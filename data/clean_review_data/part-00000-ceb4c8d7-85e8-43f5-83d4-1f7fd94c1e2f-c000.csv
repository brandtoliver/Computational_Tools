The location was handy as it was close to transportation, shops and cafes. Jon kindly accommodated our requests for a small family, and our late arrival. As a much appreciated gesture, Jon also got some breakfast food for us. The bed was very comfortable, and at least during our stay it was very quiet at night. The living room was also a good and cosy space. The wireless internet was very fast and worked with no problems. We'd stay there again, and heartily recommend it, in particular for young families."

From the moment I arrived, I could feel very comfortable and as I listen music alot, the sound system was terrific for me. Robert's house view is stunning which I can say one of top views during my travel. the transport is also very close and other supermarkets and parks as well.

Communication with her was easy, and the location and light of her flat are great -- the flat is right next to the maria torget square and one of the popular viewing points over the city.  I would definitely recommend her place for a visit to Stockholm!"
1124388,115595165,2016-11-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Very cozy, warm-feeling flat. The speakers and vinyls are awesome. Carl is friendly and easy-going. The flat is less than 15 minutes by bus to the city central."
819676,149573136,2017-05-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Vannie and Andy are really great people. Unfortunately Andy was away when we visited, but Vannie made us feel at home immediately. She helped us plan our days, told us the best grocery store to go to, and went the extra mile when we needed it. A clean place that is located right next to Gamla Stan, which is where we spent our few days. Thanks for a great stay!"

302496,77962334,2016-06-04T00:00:00.000Z,"We booked Seta's apartment for the first week of June but due to some understandable and unfortunate circumstances, Seta had to cancel our reservation. She took upon herself to arrange for a rental at her neighbor's apartment in the same building and on the same floor. We were the first guests in the alternate apartment and loved every minute of it. It is a great building in a fantastic neighborhood in an awesome city. Very easy access to transit and great restaurants in the area. If we return to Stockholm we would book either Seta's apartment or the any apartment in the building."
916806,493785889,2019-07-23T00:00:00.000Z,she's efficient on comunicating with the guest.

Tina was a friendly and helpful host, and prepared a generous breakfast for me each morning. The house was within walking distance of Stockholmsmässan, where I was attending a conference during my stay. Everything was clean and tidy, and the house was situated within a quiet, cozy neighborhood. Thanks for a lovely trip!"
954832,513378546,2019-08-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Location, location, location -- close to public transportation, quiet with a lovely community garden.  Clean with a thoughtful host."
1158893,31320055,2015-05-04T00:00:00.000Z,"It was our first experience with Airbnb. We had a marvelous stay in Stockholm, and Dany/Maria’s house was a perfect fit for our family. We were really feeling like at home, and the house was exactly as described on Airbnb site as well as large enough for our family (6 persons). Outside logistical aspect, I would like to make a standing ovation to Dany & Maria. They welcomed us in a perfect manner, and prior our journey, we had many mail exchanges with them.  Very quickly, we were feeling like we knew each other for long time. Many Thanks again, for all kindness and information provided ahead, that made adventure quite easy for us. We really recommend this place to anyone who wants to visit Stockholm."
1261445,97964221,2016-08-29T00:00:00.000Z,"This place was great! Very trendy, open plan apartment in a nice and accessible location. Great wifi, comfortable lounge area and a great size for two people. It was quite warm due to the weather but absolutely fine. Marie-Louise was a great host. Very helpful and quick to answer any questions by txt or email. Great pad for a great trip to Stockholm."

1117037,502008271,2019-08-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice stay, the appartement has everything you need. Good and fast communication with Polina. We didn't see her, but her friend Magdalena was in the appartement as well when we were there. She waited for us when we arrived late due to flightdelay, which we appreciated greatly. Quite far from city center (+/-45min with bus+/-metro), could have been faster if there was now constructionworks happening at the Metroline. We recommend this appartement for a short cheap stay near Stockholm."
242188,2380191,2012-09-23T00:00:00.000Z,Lidia was really nice and helpful! The apartment is really clean and so close to everything. Conveniently located! Loved it here.
647314,5825189,2013-07-18T00:00:00.000Z,"We spent a week there as part of a three-week trip around Sweden. The room was nice, spacious, quiet at night and with a comfortable double bed. It also has good storage and music speakers.
The kitchen and bathroom were well-equipped and easy to use.
The flat is well situated, close to metro station, restaurants, café's, parks and grocery store.
Mallika is an easy-going, kind and helpful host.

And Lidia is a very charming and warmhearted lady. I really enjoy the time I talked to her! It's quite considerate of her to give us lots of travel tips. If you're going to Stockholm, Lidia's room is highly recommended. 

房间很温馨,有独立的客厅和浴室提供给客人,周边交通便捷离老城也很近｡Lidia是位很可爱的老奶奶,非常热情,给了我们非常详尽的参观建议｡总之非常推荐｡"
164448,454995004,2019-05-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Li er meget gæstfri og hjælpsom og hun har især styr på tekniske ting.
Her er rent og stilfuldt. Stedet er meget velegnet til unge, som også har mulighed for at lære hinanden at kende."
581243,19134572,2014-09-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Great experience! Clean space, quiet enough, helpful friendly host. Very easy to get to things via the T-train or by walking. There is a shopping center connected to the building on the ground floor which was great. I'd recommend this place to anyone! Thanks Edwin!"
164448,117307729,2016-12-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia's home in Stockholm covered by far all of our expectations. The house is really near from public transport if you arrive Stockholm from Arlanda airport. It is very warm, relaxing and quiet. We spent four intense days walking around Stockholm and Lidia's house offered us the rest we needed every night. And she is so kind every moment! She offered us tea and coffee just after the arrival and spent time explaining us all kinds of tips regarding Stockholm. It remains clear she loves her home city and she loves to communicate it to visitors. The room has space enough, the beds are big, the views are nice... The neighbourhood is as quiet as cool. Really hipster area in Södermalm called SoFo. If we return to Stockholm Lidia's home will be our choice!"
299154,255035229,2018-04-19T00:00:00.000Z,Daniel är omtänksam värd och jag hade en bra övernattning.
1212891,450332014,2019-05-09T00:00:00.000Z,Très bon emplacement pour visiter Stockholm. Supérettes proches du logement. Nous avons pris tous nos repas du soir dans la cuisine bien équipée.

You can get privacy and all the comfort you’d have at your own place! And Ilona provides anything you could need! Definitely an amazing place to stay! Recommend !"
242188,146084900,2017-04-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia is absolutely incredible - the sweetest and most helpful person ever! I truly love my stay at her place! 

The bed is comfy. The room is adequate. And the bathroom is clean! 

Lidia also spent a good 30 minutes with me giving me suggestions of places to go and planning he route since I only had one day in Stockholm! She also helped me with a train ticket by calling SJ and having them send it to me electronically! She cares about her guests and helps them in any way she can!

Always offered tea and coffee, and even made me breakfast in the morning!!

All in all, stay with Lidia. You won't regret it!!

The place is also central. Easy to get anywhere in Stockholm from her place!"
1128990,468789002,2019-06-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Great location! The apartment is located in a hip nieghbourhood with many places to eat and drink. Good area to mix with the friendly locals. There is a bus stop right outside the apartment, bus #3 will take you right into the city centre and back. This was very convenient for exploring without long walks. Annette Yvonne made check in easy and comfortable. The apartment was clean and ready for our arrival and after a quick tour Annette Yvonne provided some great tips on where to go and how to get there. Very helpful!
The apartment is sectioned off in a way that makes your room feel very private. The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom is located right outside your room.

Stay here! You won't regret it.

Thank you!"
581243,216504240,2017-12-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin's place is wonderful, very clean, well located (you even have a mall downstairs with a supermarket), very good connection with public transport and if you want to walk to city center is about 30-40 min walk. We really enjoyed our stay and even though we spoke very little with Edwin he was very nice and kind. I would definitively recommend this listing. Thank you, Edwin!"
475409,2089526,2012-08-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Fantastic location, nice building and apartment, very friendly and welcoming host. They all helped to make our stay truly memorable!"
301680,43573619,2015-08-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Anitta war sehr hilfsbereit. Sie hatte leider kein geeignetes Zimmer mehr in ihrem Haus für uns 2 Personen frei und hat uns deshalb an einen Nachbarn vermittelt, dessen Haus wunderschön war und in dem wir uns während unseres Aufenthalts in Stockholm sehr wohl gefühlt haben. Der Nachbar hat uns mit wertvollen Stockholm-Tipps versorgt. Gerne kommen wir wieder her und wissen schon, wo wir uns melden werden."
299154,34060280,2015-06-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Daniel was out of town but kindly made arrangements with his friendly neighbor Rolf to help us get settled. Everything went smoothly, and the location close to the subway and old town could not have been better. It was a small studio, but one person on the sofa and one on the bed worked just fine. He left us lots of recommendations and guide books -- very helpful."
1212891,520355396,2019-08-30T00:00:00.000Z,"A very lovely host, with a very good located flat. It is a very accurated host, with amazing amenities. Everything was wonderful!"

Ospitalità ineccepibile e apprezzatissimo servizio di caffè, tè ed acqua gratuiti per gli ospiti dell'ostello (di cui l'appartamento fa parte). Molto carino anche il cortile comunitario dotato di lampade riscaldanti e coperte. Consigliatissimo!!"
624886,17560042,2014-08-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Oskar's apartment in hornstull was perfect for our family of two adults and two boys 5 and 8. We enjoyed breakfast every morning in the sunny kitchen, complemented by croissants from the cafe across the street. We ate pizza and dumplings in the neighborhood.  And we played soccer and minigolf in the large park nearby.  This is not to mention all the exploring of stockholm by bus and subway we did all week. Hornstull is a perfect location, easy access to the rest of sodermalm and the rest of the city too. The apartment was bright and sunny. Plenty of room for our family."
274876,1990783,2012-08-15T00:00:00.000Z,"We have lived in Emma's apartment for almost a week and enjoyed our being in Stockholm immensely!  Her apartment is situated very conveniently in a good area, close to bus stops and downtown. Emma gave us a lot of useful information for tourists, was very sociable and friendly! Her apartment is very spacious, light and comfortable. It is a perfect place for a family rest!"
1144069,65629398,2016-03-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Jon' apartment is very well located, best thrift store right next door! Very practical and convenient we had everything that ones could need! clean and welcoming, I would recommend his place! 
I even forgot in item that he is sending me back ☺"
647314,82482112,2016-06-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Mallika's house is clean, cosy and centrally located. It was perfect for us! We haven't seen Mallika that much, (because she was away during Midsommar weekend ) but the communication was good."
916806,62488500,2016-02-15T00:00:00.000Z,"The house was clean and furnished well(kitchen, closet, air warmer, etc.). The host's feedback was fast and kind. 

We knew that we lost our baby's bracelet there and asked Mansour, even we left the place, he gave very rapid feedback not to make us be concerned about it. Forturnately found it in our package and I appreciate mansour for rapid feedback much.
Bus station is close(3 mins by walk) and large malls were near the house. And because of playgrounds near there, my baby could spend good time there with us."
608672,112007546,2016-11-03T00:00:00.000Z,Very centrally located! We were two students traveling on break and it was the perfect size for us. Bathroom is a wet room but Karl has a great set up so you don't flood the place. Little fridge and coffee station as well. Great building!
1182616,486187477,2019-07-12T00:00:00.000Z,"You pretty much get what you pay for. The room itself is quite nice, big and clean. The bathroom was smelly at times and it can get a bit crowded if seven or eight people want to use it in the morning. The kitchen was okay, also a bit dirty so not that great for cooking, but in the fridge was some fruit that seemed to have been in there for quite a while. All in all it wasn't terrible and if it was a bit cleaner I would recommend staying there because the location is great."
145320,269848901,2018-05-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Kim has a wonderfully funky space in the heart of Södermalm!  I found her location knowledge and recommendations to be invaluable.  Kim's apartment is quiet and cozy, and I loved the small terrace with hammock."

1170766,210062985,2017-11-07T00:00:00.000Z,"One of the best airbnb experiences so far. Annika is a great host, the studio is amazingly cozy and bright. Don’t miss a chance to book a perfect place to stay."

301680,34816427,2015-06-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Preis/Leistung ist OK. Zimmer und Bett war sauber und wie angepriesen. Frühstück war \"self-service\", da die Gastgeberin in dieser Zeit (Juni) nur tagsüber da war - das war etwas enttäuschend. Lage ist sehr ruhig und genau wie beschrieben."
302496,481752340,2019-07-05T00:00:00.000Z,Stylish
581243,18185506,2014-08-23T00:00:00.000Z,"I had a wonderful experience! Edwin have great directions to his place and around the city! His place is perfectly located above a shopping center, metro, and grocery store. His place had a great view and a cozy balcony to sit and enjoy a cup of tea. The entire place was clean and bed was comfortable. Edwin was very nice and sweet! I would definitely recommend his place."
608672,19520631,2014-09-14T00:00:00.000Z,"My boyfriend and I were in September in Karl's flat. 
We got a kind welcome from Karl, he was very helpful with his explanation of the city and all his recommendations. He was flexible to check in (we arrived at 20.30)
Östermalms Saluhall was amazing!
And.... how many languages do you speak Karl???!!!

The room was nice and clean and with a mini room as a kitchen and useful bathroom even if the shower was not much uncomfortable. There are wifi.

The best advantage of the flat is its localization, very close to the city center, the main commercial street and the central station of Tbane and trains. (10min)

Highly recommended!  
If we will go again to Stockholm, we will repeat!.
Thanks Karl! :)"
1158893,175070896,2017-07-28T00:00:00.000Z,Comfortabel en groot huis met alles er op en er aan in een rustige en veilige woonwijk van een randgemeente van Stockholm. De metro en supermarkt zijn op 15 min lopen. Vriendelijke eigenaar die je van heel veel info voorziet. Goede en snelle communicatie en prima waar voor je geld in een grote stad als Stockholm waar een hotel dichter bij het centrum veel duurder en kleiner is dan dit. Echt aan te raden.
688947,48339806,2015-09-25T00:00:00.000Z,Alexandre took us in when our original host cancelled on us last minute. He replied right away and made us feel very welcome from day one. The room and bathroom is clean and the apartment smells of incense.
723539,5907445,2013-07-22T00:00:00.000Z,Mathias' apartment was a perfect place for me to stay and work while I was in Stockholm. Great apartment and in a superb location!
739726,8368302,2013-10-28T00:00:00.000Z,Sanna's flat is a really nice and cosy place to stay. We really enjoyed our weekend there! Sanna was very friendly and helpful and if i ever visit Stockholm again I would stay at her place again!
916806,28621391,2015-03-27T00:00:00.000Z,"A very nice apartment in a quiet and beautifull neighborhood! Everything was just perfect, and Mansour has been the best host ever! Thank you again to allowed us 4 to live in Stockholm, and sleep at this lovely place!"

944703,84128927,2016-07-05T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed at Christina's place for 3 nights with 3 people. It was a great stay! 

Christiana gave us a very warm welcome and was easy to approach and to communicate with in advance. Everything was well organized and prepared. 

The appartment is bright, fully equipped with everything we needed and clean. It has a nice and sunny balcony and Christina even provided a mattress for the third person. The bed was very comfy - it was hard to get up:). The neighborhood is residential, very quiet and the supermarket and metro just around the corner. It takes 15 minutes to the city centre, a metro ticket would be useful. 

Thanks Christiana for hosting us and all the best, Janine"
916806,70951813,2016-04-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Logement identique à la description, dans un cadre très calme et nature. Nous avons appréciés de pouvoir nous rendre facilement dans le centre de Stockholm ainsi que du revenir au calme le soir. Appartement très propre et fonctionnel. Adresse à retenir."
1041103,34435562,2015-06-08T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment is really cozy and absolutely perfect for a bigger group. It's close to the supermarket and public transport which was really important for us.  

Karoline and her husband were very accommodating and always at hand if we needed anything. Can really recommend staying there! 

Best,
Ibti"
647314,495649616,2019-07-26T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment and balcony are very tastefully decorated and very clean. As the room and the balcony is located to the backyard it was also very quiet, you could always leave the windows open. Mallika is a very friendly hostess and very accommodating. Key collection was very easy.
We had a very pleasant time"
1124388,26784881,2015-02-19T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment was really nice and close to the centre. Carl was very helpful, recommended us some places to see and answered every question. We had a great time in Stockholm"

299154,60213752,2016-01-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Daniel's apartment is in very good location. 2mins walk from metro, or if you want to walk from Stockholm cemtral should take around 20 mins. The apartment itself is cozy. The balcony and big TV are one of the nice feature. Daniel is also very easy to be contacted. He is very nice and helpful as well. Renting his apartment is indeed make my vacation in Stockholm even better."
954832,98082680,2016-08-29T00:00:00.000Z,Mikael is a wonderful host. Both his wife and he have paid great attention to detail in the setup of the apartment. Everything necessary is easily available. He is very responsive to questions. I would surely stay here when I come to Stockholm again. Take a walk from the apartment to the City Hall. It is perhaps one of the best things we did. Amazing views. The apartment is very well connected to the other islands and airport but still feels private.

El apartamento es pequeño pero muy bien situado, cerca de muchos restaurantes y bares, se puede ir andando a todos los sitios turísticos de Estocolmo.
El alojamiento no es el que aparece en las fotografías ya que Cor se cambió de domicilio lo comunicó a Airbnb hace meses y estos no han cambiado la información en la plataforma. 
La cama es tipo litera, con solo una cama en parte de arriba, abajo es mesa y silla para aprovechar el espacio. Cuando Cor ancle el mueble a la pared será más cómodo. 
La relación calidad precio para lo que es Estocolmo es buena.
Gracias Cor por todo."

608672,161980068,2017-06-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Superb location within Stockholm, in an 18th-century house. Karl also was a very gracious host and even went to the trouble of coming down to the street to welcome me. The apartment was very clean and functional, with everything as described, but cooking something would be a minor challenge, as kitchen section and bathroom are very small. The shower is \"nordic\" indeed (good water pressure and temperature, however!), but Karl told me that he has already applied for a building permit to upgrade it, which will make it much easier to use. I had a nice time!"
1170766,196782083,2017-09-24T00:00:00.000Z,Annika's place is simply awesome! What a lovely place. The neighborhood is one of the best in Stockholm. It is close to the old town but it is super fun and hip. One can get to most part of Stockholm easily. Annika is a great host as well.

The shower was a slightly unusual arrangement but there was plenty of hot water.  The kitchenette had enough equipment  for making  a simple meal, and there was a supermarket - and wine store - very close. We needed to wash done clothes and were able to use the communal washing machine and dryer. It is best to ask Karl in advance though as the residents have to book a slot for the use of the machine."

I really appreciated how friendly and welcoming Andy was from the very greeting he did by opening the door. Also, he kindly let me use the laundry machine :) It was also so wonderful to meet his brother’s family.

During the heat wave, Andy thoughtfully put in a rotating fan tower and also the small refrigirator in the private room also helped a lot! The private bathroom right across from the room is so modern and convenient! 

5 stars for being easy to communicate, central location ( Please try Cardamom Bread from Fabrique Bakery. I had that every morning! Soooo gooood!) and comfort of all the things offered at this apartment by this awesome host! Highly recommend!"

Vi hilste kort på Peter, han virkede rigtig rar. Det var specielt at der også var andre airbnb'ere i lejligheden, men de var alle rigtig søde, så det var en god oplevelse. 
Desuden var Peter virkelig hurtig til at svare på ens beskeder! :-)"

688947,20956944,2014-10-08T00:00:00.000Z,"The Airbnb Slogan \"Welcome home!\" totally fits at Alexandres fresh home with peace and silence. Once you arrive, you feel home, and thats for sure, especially of Alexandres warm and good-natured heart. I stayed with my best Friend for one Week and it was such an nice and peacefull experience there. When we arrived, Alexandre showed us the cosy, warm and very cleaned rooms of his small flat, and after that he had invited us to his Bandproofing near his house. It was fun, getting in touch with him and his friends very soon after arriving. And his Band is very awesome, that was a first great experience of our stay! In his cosy flat we have felt very welcomed the whole time.  The bedroom which is provided for his guests, is likewise all the other rooms very clean, cosy and you get a very good sleep in there! Erverthing as described in here. The neighbourhood is very quiet and as he described, peacefull. So you have a nice place to relax from your daily trips into the city of Stockholm. And Alexandre bothers about your needs and cares, he is an awesome guy with the heart on the right side. One evening he tooks us to his favorite jazzbar, to show us the nightlife of gmala stan and it was such a great evening there! He and his friends are so nice and pleasent, we're so happy getting to know some of them. We really miss the time at his flat, besides to a comfortable room during our stay we have found a really good friend in Alexandre, which  we already miss alot. He has such a great living philosophie, which we're taking with us back to germany. I only can recommended Alexandres home to everyone, who is interessted to a friendly and open minded guy and looking for  a peaceful home for a short or longer stay in Stockholm. Just feel welcomed at Alexandres very cosy home, with so much positive energy and gain! We will return for sure! Thanks for everything, Alexandre ! :) <3"

The facility is clean and we feel like at home. Our room is located upstair while the host live down stair. We have all the privacy as the host does not come up stair at all. She does come up to tidy/clean the place while we were out. Lidia allowed us to check out late which has been very useful as our departure from Stockholm is at 2:00 pm. The place is centrally located. Stockholm old town, major shopping areas, City Hall etc. are all within walking distance. Only one stop from the central train station. We thoroughly recommend this place to other travellers."

Daniel's apartment location is ridiculously convenient: a few steps away from the Slussen subway station, coffee, food, shopping and walking trails for a beautiful view across the Riddarfjärden. Close to Götgatan and a quick subway ride to Gamlastan. 

The apartment balcony is lovely for people-watching.

The subway, along with a good sized supermarket and a few shops, is a 2 minute walk away. Karoline was very accommodating and kind.

But i’d never met a host as kind and thoughtful as Andre. here’s what happened: Whenever i book, i book “entire place”. This time i must’ve forgotten to turn on that filter, so it was a surprise when me and my wife learned, upon arriving, that we’d rented just a room. However, andre offered to crash at a friend’s house just to give us privacy. And he did. Communication with him was fluid, he’s the kind of person we could be friends with. The place itself is big, clean, nice, and the bed is really comfortable. Loved the sodermalm area as well, full of cafes and very well connected. Highly recommended!!!"

The house was beautifully decorated with lots of space to relax and play (my 6 year old especially loved all of the LEGO!). Dany and Maria provided us with a ton of information about the house and the area, responded quickly to any questions, and left really thoughtful items for us to use (snacks and staples in the fridge) after our long flight. 

We would not hesitate to stay here again! Highly recommended."
581243,10769228,2014-03-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Although we were only able to visit Stockholm for a short time, we were very pleased and grateful for our experience at this listing.  Edwin was flexible with our check-in and check-out time and provided us with plenty of ideas of where to visit and eat.  His apartment was beautiful, clean, and exactly as pictured.  We really enjoyed the location too - directly above a shopping center that includes restaurants, grocery stores, and other stores.  Metro was minutes away and walk to center of Stockholm while a bit longer was still enjoyable! We would definitely recommend!"
164448,52130139,2015-10-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia was quite nice - she was prepared to spend time going over maps and offering suggestions for sightseeing as well as restaurants and museums. I immediately dropped off my bags and set off for a marathon of museums, cathedrals, etc., armed with spare maps and advice. 
The location was absolutely perfect. One block from the train station; checked out the nearby pub (quite nice and decent food); two cafes, both of which had excellent coffee, and a grocery store. 
I really enjoyed the stay."

624886,369091053,2019-01-09T00:00:00.000Z,Oskar was an amazing host. We stayed over the new year holiday so we only communicated via text. He responded to our questions very quickly. The flat is beautifully decorated and updated. Our boys were delighted to stay in the children's room. They so graciously left their toys around for our kids to play with all week. This was really the perfect home for our family of four.
536283,6212079,2013-08-04T00:00:00.000Z,We  enjoyed  our stay at Paolo's. His studio is very well located and we managed to find everything we needed in the neighborhood. Thanks Paolo!

The room is very cozy, location is great. Perfect place for those who would like to stay in a quiet peaceful place close to nature, but at the same time be not far from the city center.
There is a nice park and a forest nearby. Lots of birds, rabbits are running all around. Couple of times I even saw little deers! 
Very easy connection to the city center, trains and buses go regularly and accurately. The kitchen is well equipped, even more than I needed. I would strongly recommend this place."
700113,56431974,2015-12-13T00:00:00.000Z,Ilona was a very gracious and accommodating host! She was kind enough to meet me at a late hour and the flat was just as described. Strongly recommend and would stay again!

Great communication with Karin, she had some excellent tips and recommendations for us."
1182616,115018837,2016-11-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Peter was a great host, he was really helpful and flexible. The apartment was clean and cozy, well-equipped and situated really good, the neighborhood is mostly quiet and in few minutes of walk you can find metro station, many shops, many restaurants, and in 15-20 minutes of walk you can already reach the city centre. Sharing only one bathroom with the other occupiers can be a little uncomfortable, the mornings can be little busy but anyway I can recommend this apartment for everyone, I would choose it next time too."

We found the bed to be a little tight for two people and the comforter was a little too small, but otherwise the apartment was great.  It is very close to a metro station, so it was a good base for exploring Stockholm. 

I would definitely recommend staying with Gustaf!"

1124388,5953818,2013-07-23T00:00:00.000Z,"My partner and I spent a really lovely weekend in Stockholm staying at Carl's apartment. The place was very cosy, the building clean and nice, the bus stop right outside the door. Carl made us feel very welcome, helped us with directions and was overall an amazing host!
My personal favourites during the stay were the bird feeder on the window and the prettiest ever shower curtain :)"

Maud也是超級可愛,非常熱情的主人,她從早期的沙發客開始就願意接待各國的訪客,真是一位很nice的友人｡希望下次來Stockholm還住在這裡!"
739726,5860340,2013-07-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Lovely home, just as pictured with roomy lounge and nice decorations.  Kitchen has table big enough for eating AND map reading/planning.  Closest café (Il Caffé) has good coffee, sticky buns and Wi-Fi - Gilda Café nice but no Wi-Fi.  We found bus no. 76, an easy walk from apt. even with luggage, takes you to Kungstradgarden and on to St. Peters Line ferry terminal. Without luggage, walking to Gamla Stan and beyond very do-able.  Sanna a cheery hostess.  We look forward to having a coffee with you one day in Sydney.  July, 2013"

The room size is good, but a little dirty. 
Laundry place is a basement and should booking by host before use. 
Dean was nice host. That is reasonable price."
170651,1738691,2012-07-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Marie's flat is lovely. Very chilled and bohemian. The local neighourhood is great - lots of nice coffee bars, cafes and close to the water. It's a bit more alternative than other parts of Stockholm we visited - and all the better for it. Metro is 5 mins walk away, so it's easy to get to the centre. Recommend it & Marie is really nice too."
283446,46332649,2015-09-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Thanks for suggesting Ms. Vidhi's listing AIRBNB. I just felt being at home.

Definitely, will recommend this listing.

Thank you for your kindness Ms. Vidhi!"

700113,112476488,2016-11-06T00:00:00.000Z,"This was my first solo airbnb and trip in general. I couldn't have chosen a better place. Ilona is an amazing host. She was very helpful and welcoming.  The studio itself is spacious and has cooking utensils, pots, and pans now! The place is also located within an 8 minute walk from a subway station. The neighborhood has quite a few restaurants and bars which is a plus. The grocery store is 5 minutes away. The day before my departure my luggage zipper gave out on me and the luggage store was closed due to the holiday. Thankfully Ilona had a spare. She's so kind! Also on the day of my departure it snowed and she offered to take me to the central train station. If and when I return I will definitely stay here again!"
608672,424853988,2019-03-17T00:00:00.000Z,A lovely little space in an ideal location. Couldn’t be better!

Very close to the subway, grocery stores, restaurants, and anything else a person might need. The apartment is enormous and is decorated in a stylish, artistic manner. The kitchen is very well equipped and my son made great use of the laundry room!  Seta and Goran are a pleasure in person and I hope to stay at their place again in the future!"

En lineas generales el apartamento esta bien, es amplio, muy ordenado, y sobre todo muy bien situado en una zona céntrica lo que permite recorrer los puntos mas importantes de la ciudad a pie, rodeada de bares, restaurantes y comercios. 
Como punto negativo encontramos que la cama es pequeña y las almohadas un tanto incomodas y por otro lado las cortinas dejan pasar la luz de la mañana!"
242188,423132146,2019-03-13T00:00:00.000Z,Allt är guld. Li tar mycket väl hand om sina gäster och det märks att hon har stor vana av att ta hand om folk.

We were provided with everything stated in the ad, and although Peter wasn't there at the time of our arrival, our 'check-in' and 'check-out' went very smoothly."
1170766,16742248,2014-08-01T00:00:00.000Z,"We enjoyed very much our week-long stay in Annika's flat. It's a large loft-like room with all facilities and a terrace. The flat is located  in an spacious attic which has been recently modernized and equipped. It's very bright with windows in two directions (east and west). 
The building is a 3 storey building without elevator but the staircase is comfortable and we didn't find it difficult to climb the steps to the flat.
Location couldn't have been better: in the trendy part of Stockholm, Södermalm, close to shops, restaurants, and transport (buses and underground) but still quiet and near to parks and lake Mälaren. The neighbourhood has plenty of beautiful classified buildings.
Communication with Annika works very well and she is very helpful. We would definitely like to come back to her flat."
575371,191948294,2017-09-09T00:00:00.000Z,Appartamento a 20 minuti a piedi dal centro di Stoccolma ma comunque comodo per visitare la città. É andato tutto benissimo.. peccato per i vicini di casa che facevano rumore ma senza nessuna colpa dell'host.

242188,508652007,2019-08-13T00:00:00.000Z,Excelente opción si vas de visita a Estocolmo. Está a 2 minutos caminado la estación del metro y desde allí puedes moverte a cualquier parte de la ciudad. La limpieza y atención del anfitrión en los consumibles es muy buena. Y tal cual se muestra en las fotografías será lo que estará esperándote.
1212891,502889373,2019-08-05T00:00:00.000Z,La camera in cui abbiamo soggiornato si trova in una zona molto tranquilla e soprattutto dovesi respira aria molto (Website hidden by Airbnb) siamo trovati benissimo e soprattutto la metro è a breve distanza rispetto alla posizione della casa.Maud è stata molto gentile e soprattutto molto disponibile per le nostre richieste.
647314,9641843,2014-01-04T00:00:00.000Z,We had a very nice time in Stockholm. Mallika is real nice host and sharing the flat with her was very easy.

Thank you Mallika!
608672,107370142,2016-10-10T00:00:00.000Z,Karl was a very gracious host and everything was exactly as advertised.  The location is perfect for exploring Stockholm.
1182616,12765874,2014-05-10T00:00:00.000Z,"The set up and logistics getting keys and checking out was great and the apartment/room is in a great location in Stockholm, close to all public transport and the airport bus. It is a 3 bedroom apartment but note the doors to individual rooms do not have locks on them so you would not have a separate key to the room. Never met Peter but he responds to emails very quickly so there were no problems at all."
442837,7660905,2013-09-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Jo was a great host, and her place was super convenient to all points in Stockholm. I would def highly recommend staying here!"
533880,7221418,2013-09-11T00:00:00.000Z,"WOW!  If you're looking for a place to stay in Stockholm's most prestigious area, look no further.  Jarl's place is a 5-8 minute walk to the Stadion T (subway) stop.  Then it's one stop to Ostermalm, the \"Rodeo Drive\" area of Stockholm, and one more stop to Central Station, in the heart of Stockholm and easy transfers to any other subway line.  

The room is peaceful and functional.  I found the bed very comfortable.  It's basic and clean.  It's at ground level, but extremely quiet at night on his street.  For the price Jarl is charging, it's a steal.   I still can't believe the incredible value for money and feel so lucky I stumbled upon it on AirBnB.  

Jarl's place is very close to Djurgarden, the gorgeous, fairy-tale-like island in Stockholm Harbor, where the main tourist attractions are located, like the Vasa Museum and Skansen.  Do venture there and do not miss Rosendal's Tragard, a lovely organic farm and cafe, with pastoral outdoor seating areas and great food.  

Jarl is a very kind and wonderful host.   He totally respects your privacy yet is available whenever you need his assistance.  I needed to get up for an early-ish flight home and he gave me a second alarm clock so I could make sure to be up in time.  He also printed out an email I needed to show the airline on check-in.

I highly recommend Jarl's place.  Enjoy your time in magical Stockholm!"
299154,134452680,2017-02-27T00:00:00.000Z,Perfect !

She came to pick us up from the central train station when we arrived to show us the way to her house with public transportation - very nice of her and super handy! Her house is easy to find and is 30 mins from Stockholm with a bus and a metro. Our room in Margareta's place was like in the pictures: big, nice space, with a door to her balcony. We also had a private bathroom and could use the kitchen for breakfast and dinner as we liked.

It was a very nice stay and we would definitely recommend!"

Die Wohnung ist ein guter Ausgangspunkt für alle möglichen Stadterkundungen in Stockholm. Die schönsten Plätze in Södermalm, Gamla Stand und in der City sind zu Fuß zu erreichen. 
Bei kleinen Fragen zwischendurch war Karin immer zu erreichen."

The contact with Karin was really friendly and easy. 
Thanks again for the wonderfull stay and the hospitality. We really enjoyed our stay."

-Close to Fridehelmsplan metro station, some lovely restaurants and a picturesque park.
- Close to the city centre...About 5 mins from Stockholm central and 10 mins from Gamla Stan.
Cons:
-The room was dirty...Almost every area slightly inaccessible to a broom had dust gathered (below the bed, the corners, furniture, etc)
-The host doesn't live here...I was under the impression that he does through our communication but didn't meet him even once for the 3 days I was there.
-Had reached after a 15 hr flight at around 4pm to find the room wasn't ready...Had to wait until 7 pm until it was habitable. So much for a 3pm check in.
- Bathroom is shared by three (Website hidden by Airbnb) you can imagine the inaccessibility. We were lucky that the other guests didn't wake up too early but I would imagine it would get difficult at most times.
- Bathroom sink kept on clogging up...Which was pretty nauseating. The shower cabinet is pretty (Website hidden by Airbnb) only 5'11 but still found it difficult navigating the place. 
-The balcony is not really a private (Website hidden by Airbnb) divided by a curtain between your room and the next. There isn't a door for the next room but a window into the balcony which meant a person could get access to your room through this area. For this reason, we had to lock the doors at night which made it pretty claustrophobic."

• Beautiful building.

628555,6444073,2013-08-12T00:00:00.000Z,"If you are looking for a place to stay in Stockholm, look no further! Anna's home really was a wonderful retreat for us. It is really well located, being just outside the hustle and bustle of the city... it's a relaxing place to come home to after touring islands or shopping. It's on a great Metro line which links to Central Station plus the other major stops and so it's super easy to get to and back. Anna's home is a 10 minute walk (or 3 min bus ride) from the Metro and the metro itself takes 10/15 mins to central stockholm. Perfect! Anna's home is really spacious too and has a wonderful Swedish designer feel to it - like staying in a boutique hotel. Anna herself was a wonderful host. She answered everything within minutes of us texting and gave us some great tips for restaurants, islands etc. We were staying a week in Sweden - Stockholm for 2 days, then canoeing in the country and then Stockholm again. After staying 1 night in Anna's place, we decided we wanted to stay there again when we got back to Stockholm. Anna was great! She approved the stay straight away, and also let us leave our bags etc in her flat whilst we went canoeing. This saved us so much hassle on our trip! Go for it - you wont be disappointed. We want to come back!!!"

La cuisine et la salle de bain sont utilisables en toute liberté. Maud est une personne très accueillante et serviable, tout à fait disposée à donner des renseignements sur la vie à Stockholm. 
L'appartement est par ailleurs très bien placé, à cinq minutes à pied du métro et des supermarchés environnants. De plus le quartier est très agréable, avec la proximité de quais donnant sur le lac Mälar. Il est possible à l'occasion de longer ces quais à pied (environ 1h) ou à vélo jusqu'au centre historique de Stockholm, Gamla Stan."

She even bought butter, eggs and cheese for when I arrived."

Left a shelf for me in the fridge (stocked with cheese, butter, cream, PB&J, etc.)  and had a metro card I could reload (easy at the 7-11 down the street) - and had lots of great advice for things to do in the neighborhood and area.  The bed is very comfy and she has a great bath/shower too.   Very much a mi casa- su casa feel. The apartment is spacious and up one flight.  Flat was a great refuge from the conference center, and she was very friendly as well.  The location and neighborhood is fantastic, close to tons of great restaurants and bars, easy access and short walk to the T and bus."

He went out of his way and actually picked us up from the station to help us out. The apartment was quiet, clean and beautiful. We didn’t get to spend much time there as we were out the entire day. It has all the utilities you need. Nothing but good things to say. Thank you Jesper and Sofie :)"

581243,33977137,2015-06-03T00:00:00.000Z,"We spent 9 nights at Edwin's. The room was exactly as described, quite comfortable and immaculately clean, just as the rest of the apartment. Even though we did not request it, our bed sheets and bath towels were changed after the first four days. We had easy access to the kitchen in the morning, and the fact that there is only one bathroom in the whole apartment turned out not to be  an issue.
Edwin and Ladiya are extremely gracious hosts, and Edwin's directions to find the apartment are flawless. The apartment is on the 4th floor of a very well located building. The Karlaplan metro station is right below the building. Once you exit the metro station you find yourself in a shopping center with two large supermarkets, a variety of shops, restaurants, and pharmacies. Shops close at 18:00 hrs and the supermarkets at 22:00 hrs.
We did all our touring on foot, because the apartment is only about ten minutes away from Strandvagen. 
We thank Edwin and his wife Ladiya for a very comfortable stay."
1117037,290401174,2018-07-14T00:00:00.000Z,Polina is a nice host and she made sure that everything was perfectly organised. Her place is conenviently located to walk from there to Stockholmmässan. It is also next to a subway station.

1250227,246392942,2018-03-25T00:00:00.000Z,This is an excellent place with an excellent host. But BEWARE it does not have WIFI and this is a big problem since it is not advertised. This impacted our trip negatively and we had to go chasing around for some internet and could not have the business meetings we needed properly etc. Otherwise the host was great (SMS and call only) and would stay there again if WIFI becomes available. Otherwise I would NOT recommend this apartment.

Maud's apartment is very well located, a 10 minute ride from the city via the subway. Subway trains run on a very regular schedule. Despite the proximity to the city the neighbourhood is very peaceful and quiet. We enjoyed our 4 night stay at Maud's apartment. We recommend it for singles and couples on a short stay.

Overall, we think they are very inexperienced about (Website hidden by Airbnb) were disappointed, we have rented many times in Europe and really this time we encountered some problems.
No privacy drapes on living room and 1 bedroom window (we had to hang some dark cheap fabric drapes bought by the previous renter). Kitchen was not clean (oven in real bad shape) old refrigerator  toaster  ultra small old microwave all in bad conditions, furniture including sofas and rugs are very warn  sitting in front of a window without curtains, facing  neighbors, iron not functioning.
The owner replaced old pots that we had scratched clean but this was not enough to make us feel comfortable.
Some art is  extreme and too explicit, dark religious, and of sexual unnecessary display.We are liberal adults who love art but that was really too much."

The apartment is filled with sunlight, is furnished with lots of nice swedish design pieces and has a great kitchen which we didn't use much as there are great restaurants just around the corner. Calle provided us with a great list with tipps on what to see and do in Stockholm. Although we didn't meet Calle and his family in person I can recommend him and his place as he seems to be a really nice guy and a great communicator. Thank you for having us! We'd love to come back one day."

Gamla Stan and even Djurgarden are in walking distance. The location is convenient and fine if you spend a lot of time out, but the kitchen is quite cramped and dark. The bed is soft if you like that, it was comfortable enough to sleep. Daniel's apartment has lots of his things so it can feel a bit cluttered but he is a responsive and reliable host."

347192,37320400,2015-07-06T00:00:00.000Z,"We liked the flat. 

It`s pretty big especially living room, very cozy and situated very good - 5 minutes walk to metro station and only one stop to Gamla Stan. The supermarket in one minutes walk.

Matilda was very friendly - we arrive and depart late and it wasn`t any problem with it.

The only thing - the second bedroom is very small and may be not very conveniend for the second couple but if you are traveling with a child I think it`s OK. 

So we had a good time in the flat and could recomend it."

475409,131699869,2017-02-13T00:00:00.000Z,"The location is good which is only 3 stops from T-central station, very convenient for city tour. Because it is located in old town we have to take some stairs up to find the location in the street and after enter the door on the first floor, there are still stairs before finding the  room. It will be a bit hard if taking heavy luggages. But it is great that Correta helps a lot for taking good care of us, including guidance for city visit and shopping. Very good company to stay with:)"
274876,15388545,2014-07-08T00:00:00.000Z,"My family spent six days in beautiful Stockholm. Emma waited for us when we arrived and she was very friendly and helpful with recommendations. Her apartment was a perfect choice for us four as it was well furnished, stylish, clean, comfortable and really quiet with a nice neighbourhood! Our kids (18 and 20) were happy about their own bedrooms. Emma’s place was well located, close to a supermarket and public transport. All in all a perfect place for relaxing after an exciting day in Stockholm. Thanks Emma!"
313195,22048051,2014-10-28T00:00:00.000Z,"David var ett bra värd och han har en vacker lägenhet! Det var jag och en vän som bodde här och vi älskade den. Vi hade vår egna sovrum, ett härligt kök och vardagsrum, och vi var nära restauranger, kaféer, och barer. Det är enkelt att gå till Odenplan eller bara 25 minuter till Centrum. Det var snällt av David för att låta oss använder sin kylskåpet och mat, men vi var ute i staden så mycket. Det var trevligt att komma tillbaka till ett bekväm, folklig ställe att sova eller att ta en små frukost och kaffe. David var lätt att nå med frågor och visade mig runt omkring lite också. Tack!!

David was a wonderful host and has a beautiful apartment! My friend and I lived here for four nights and we loved it. We had our own beds, a wonderful kitchen and living room, and we werve very close to good restaurants, cafes, and bars. It was easy to walk to Odenplan or only about 25 minutes to downtown. It was nice of David to offer his fridge and food, but we were out so much around town anyway. It was great to come back to a comfortable, homey place to sleep and maybe have breakfast and coffee. David was easy to reach with questions and even with his busy schedule showed me around a bit, too! Thanks, David!"

862528,41571477,2015-08-08T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a fantastic stay in Arne's house with our two little daughters. The house is well-located for a journey in Stockholm area, 15mn from the city by car and close to a metro station direct to the centre. Arne was hère to welcome us and showed us kindly and quickly all what to know about the house.
The house is extremely pleasant, nicely decorated  and very convenient for à Family with its garden and its two terraces, a large living-room and opened cuisine, the 3.bedrooms and bathrooms... Arne arranged us a crib and a high chair. The Nespresso machine, the Netflix access were nice bonus. Everything went extremely well, except maybe the unconfortable king-size bed (too soft for us)... We highly recommand Arne and his house for your future stay in Stockholm!!"
1212891,58790648,2016-01-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud hat uns mit einem warmherzigen und freundlichen Lächeln begrüßt und uns alle nötigen Dinge für unseren Aufenthalt bereitgestellt. 
Das Zimmer war groß genug, damit zwei Menschen sich darin ausbreiten können. Es gab neben dem Bett einen kleinen Kleiderschrank, einen Tisch und mehrere Schränkchen mit Schubläden. In diesen befand sich neben nützlichen Dingen auch eine Mappe mit Informationen über verschiedene Attraktionen rund um Stockholm. Das Bett war mit 1,20 Meter gerade ausreichend für zwei Personen, aber super neu und komfortabel. 
Wir haben uns zu jeder Zeit super wohl gefühlt und konnten uns an allen Sachen bedienen, die wir zum Leben/Schlafen/Kochen benötigt haben. 
Auch war Maud uns stets mit Rat und Tat zur Seite gestanden, als Fragen bezüglich Stockholm aufkamen. Diese beantwortete sie sofort durch verschiedene Karten und Flyern, vielen Informationen und einem ständigen Lächeln. 
Die Wohnung selbst liegt etwa zehn Minuten von der nächsten S-Bahn-Station entfernt und die Fahrt ins Zentrum dauert ungefähr 15 Minuten.
Maud war einfach eine mega herzliche Gastgeberin, die dafür gesorgt hat, dass man sich als Gast rundum wohlfühlt und es einem an nichts mangelt!"

Una casa pulitissima, molto curata nei dettagli, comoda per 5 persone e con tutto l'occorrente visto che in realtà è una casa abitata dalla proprietaria, che è stata molto flessibile anche con il chek-out (abbiamo potuto lasciare la casa il pomeriggio dato che il volo era verso sera), inoltre ci ha lasciato le tessere da ricaricare  per i mezzi di trasporto che altrimenti avremmo dovuto acquistare...queste sono delle piccole attenzioni verso l'ospite che non trovi dappertutto, quindi grazie."

He was very prompt in responding to the booking request and later inquiries.  He clearly makes every attempt to accommodate guests. Terry's apartment was exactly as advertised.  It was clean & has all the amenities needed.  It is in a very convenient location, only 2 stops on the metro from the central station, & only a few minutes walk from there.  I can recommend Terry & his apartment without hesitation.  Thanks Terry!!"

Its conveniently located close to everything withbwonderful communications near by.  My room was neat, clean, spacious and had wonderful light.  I slept woderfully, with quiteness and comfort.  The showe is excellent, abundant hot water, great after a long day of walking.  I felt pretty much at home, Lidia made me feel immediately welcomed, helped me with asertive suggestions of ways and places ti visit, her daily opinions helped me to make the best of my time in this fantastic city.  Her breakfast was delicious, in a cozy luminious table, with everything so esquisitely arranged and presented.  i can still taste those crunchy croissants, perfect way to start a busy day!!! Those tastybcheeses, hams and salamis!!! Fruit, eggs, everything!! Thank you Lidia!!! I look forward in returning to Stockholm and to stay of course in Lidias place, she is a warm, helpful open woman offering a veryncomfortable apartment to stay!

723539,50370892,2015-10-11T00:00:00.000Z,"I stayed at Mathias' with two close friends. As this was the first time using AirBnB I was pretty nervous but it turned out great. Definitely priceworthy. 

The apartment is cozier and more personalized than I feel the pictures and description convey. The cleaning rules might seem rigid, but read once more they are really common sense. I guess Mathias, despite this, has had some negative experienced regarding checking out, hence the rules. 

If you are more than two people you must be okay with sharing beds as there are only one bed and one couch (that you can fold out into a bed). The kitchen is small but felt well planned and well equipped. We never cooked food but found everything we needed for making breakfast and snacks. It might be good to know that you are allowed to use essentials such as tea, coffee, butter, beans etc. If you are unsure just ask Mathias. 

He was reachable by phone and mail the whole stay. Unfortunately we never got the chance to meet but both check in and check out ran smoothly. The day of our arrival he called which was a much appreciated gesture. 

For us the location was perfect: central and quiet with beautiful buildings surrounding us. As an apartment at Östermalm is ridiculously expensive we felt lucky to get to live there, if only for a few days, and felt immediately at home. 

To sum it up: we were all three very happy with our stay and would love staying there again at future visits to Stockholm."
757320,515488579,2019-08-23T00:00:00.000Z,"We really liked to stay at Barb‘s apartment. The location is perfect (close to the old town and in the center of Södermalm which is a very cool part of town). The room was cosy and clean and Barb is a very friendly host. The thing we didn‘t like was that she wanted to communicate by SMS which distegards the Airbnb rules. Communication only worked when using SMS, otherwise we didn’t get a response. But still we enjoyed our stay very much!"
533880,293928255,2018-07-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Jarl is a great host.  He was away traveling during much of my stay, but he still took care to make sure I had everything I needed and familiarized me with the building. He’s friendly, easy-going and quick to reach.  His apartment is central to many areas in Stockholm, and is also close to the local nightlife areas.  The room itself is quite large, much more than I was expecting for a city apartment."

The apartment was very close to transit and Gamla Stan (be aware that people are out enjoying themselves fairly late into the night, and you will be very close to that action).

Квартира очень чистая, мебель новая, санузел в прекрасном состоянии. Порадовала также продуманность бытовых мелочей: полотенца, посуда, необходимые для готовки специи, соусы и тд. Всё это предоставлено в большом количестве. Если выйти из дома и повернуть направо, в трёх минутах ходьбы есть отличная детская площадка в парке. Поэтому проблем с тем, где погулять вечером с ребёнком, также не возникало. Там же находится пункт раздельного сбора мусора. Локация: до метро идти около 3-5 минут. Пешком до станции T centralen около 15-20 минут. Мы любим гулять и ходили пешком в музей Васа и Юнибакен, это занимало около 40 минут. Если вы любите бегать, то рекомендовал бы парк рядом с музеем Васа, до него около 3 километров от дома. Для ребёнка в квартире комфортные условия, единственно нет детской кроватки (это хозяева сообщили заранее, поэтому неприятных неожиданностей не было). Поэтому я спал в гостиной, так как втроём спать на одной кровати было бы неудобно. Я однозначно рекомендую данное жильё, оно полностью соответствует описанию, очень чистое и абсолютно новое."

1212891,524213277,2019-09-05T00:00:00.000Z,"This is a very clean, comfortable bedroom in a small apartment. The host provides well organized supplies and spaces in kitchen and bathroom. The bathroom is shared with the host and perhaps a guest in the second bedroom. The host is helpful and thoughtful. She has a nice cat named Sammy. The place is a 5 - 10 minute walk from a metro (Tunnelbana) station, so it is easy to get around Stockholm from here. Getting to know this woman was a big part of my happy visit to Stockholm!"
620848,3400450,2013-01-23T00:00:00.000Z,"We had the pleasure to stay for 12 days here in january.

IT has been a very nice stay with great flexibilty and everything in order! 

We felt very welcome and we will defenetly use this again.

The best and most cosy stay ever which we can absolutely recommend everyone."

1182616,27813772,2015-03-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Pretty nice location. 
Really easy going stay in a nice bright room!"
916806,6362304,2013-08-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Very nice apartment with a really big terrace. Everything was clean and comfortable. The kitchen has everything you need to prepare a breakfast and dinner. The apartment is about 10min far from the metro station (by foot), where you can also find a lot of supermarkets. from the metro station is takes about 20min to the city center of Stockholm. I would recommend the apartment to other guest. It is very quiet with a lot of nature nearby and it isn't quite far to the city center."
1041103,445859297,2019-04-30T00:00:00.000Z,"I stayed 1 month at Karoline's. The flat is very clean and cosy. Regarding the bedroom it's very light that is nice but if you need dark to sleep you won't manage. She tried her best to create instaneneous curtains for me tho. Karoline is very reactive when you need something. 
She lives with her son and they wake up very early in the morning (around 6am). They always try to be discrete but there is no door in the living room so you listen to the TV every time it is on. So if you are a morning person there is no problem but if you are not you might be waken up if you have a light sleep. There is also no micro wave so if you are a lazy cooker it's not easy. 
The flat is well located in a calm district not far from the center and it's quite cute. I would definitely recommend it if you want to stay for few weeks as rents in Stockholm used to be very high and there is no so much flats to book."
1262188,14612445,2014-06-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Karin's place is centrally located,  very convenient to the train station and buses, close to grocery stores and shopping. The apartment is spacious, open plan,  super clean, comfortable, windows all around for nice light and ventilation; a sitting porch, a well-equipped eat-in kitchen, a large bathroom with tub and washing machine, a bedroom and a bed in the large living space. Karin provided us with detailed and abundant suggestions on places to visit, especially tailored for our interests! She is exceedingly well-organized and thoughtful in her preparations of the apartment. Great communications. Our highest recommendations for Karin as a terrific airbnb host!"
1035775,43756021,2015-08-22T00:00:00.000Z,Nice appartement with balcony. Elevator and not far away from water.

Je recommande ce airbnb !"

Beaucoup de bons conseils et d'aide (réservations, vérification  des horaires de la ligne de bus de nuit pour prendre mon avion) et de succulents repas indiens! je recommande vraiment, des \"good vibes\" :)"

242188,72568182,2016-05-03T00:00:00.000Z,"I had a really comfortable stay at Lidia's flat. She gave me great directions from the airport, and though I arrived rather late, she welcomed me with a pot of tea and made me a map with a few places to check out the next day."
647314,2393225,2012-09-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Me and my mother stayed in Mallika’s beautiful apartment for a week. Mallika is a very nice person with a positive energy. She gave us lots of great tips for exploring Stockholm. The location of the apartment couldn’t be better, it’s in one of the coolest areas of the city with lots of boutiques, restaurants and cafes. And within easy reach of the rest of the city, since the subway is just around the corner. Highly recommended!"
688947,102229179,2016-09-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Alexandre was a great host during our 3 night stay (you can feel the warm latin vibe ;) ), he gave us nice and key advices on what was worth to visit, and we confirmed he really knows his way around! 
The house is in a calm neighbourhood and really close to the nearest train station, so in around 30 minutes you can travel to the old center and the more turistic spots.

Alexandre  had already warned us that wifi was not available at the moment, and he was kind enough to share his phone for internet when necessary."
1124388,5583172,2013-07-07T00:00:00.000Z,"This was first travel for our family (3 person) in Scandinavia and first experience stay in apartment. Carl is very friendly and hospitable host  for travelers . There were nice breakfast, fresh towels and clean apartment, good wi-fi and everything necessary. Great location in quiet place in island. For the little beach we went about  5 minutes, where bath people. Beside apartment locate little supermarket and tai-food, pizza, Indian food, fast-food cafe. About  10-15 min away from apartment to city center in Bus № 1 (Stop called “Cityterminallen”).
We really enjoyed our trip and Stockholm!
Very recommend Carl’s apartment for everybody!"
1248490,454377843,2019-05-18T00:00:00.000Z,"We spent 6 wonderful days in Stockholm, and it was the best accommodation in my life. When I was choosing the flat to stay in the city, I looked through more than 100 variants and I'm so glad to find Maria's apartment. 
For me and my family the most important criteria were quiet nearby and convenient location. So, the surroundings are very calm and the location is really unbelievable. 
About 10 minutes to get to Skanstull underground station, 4 minutes to get to Gotlandsgatan or Södermannangatan busstops, 5 minutes - Ljusterögatan busstop, from where it's so easy to go to Slussen, Gamla Stan, Odenplan, Ropsten, T-Centralen... and wherever you need. 
5 minutes to get to Coop supermarket.
2 parks are so close if you want to take a walk. 
And many cafes and shops nearby! 
People who like walking can easily get to the centre (Gamla Stan) without public transport: it'll take about 25 minutes on foot. 
For us it was also convenient because we arrived in Stockholm by Viking Line ferry (20-25 minutes by bus with 1 change). 
The flat. It's very cosy, comfortable, beautiful, stylish and spacious! 2 toilets, pretty balcony, well-equipped kitchen with fridge full of tasty sauces, jams and whatever (Maria let us take everything from the fridge). We mostly cooked ourselves, and it was easy and comfortable to cook porridge or pasta on the stove. The  design of the flat is wonderful. And the views are hard to describe! When you have breakfast or supper, you sit in the kitchen and admire crowns of the trees in the street, Sofia church and the park nearby, when you sit in the balcony with a cup of tea, you enjoy wonderful old roofs of the block. 
The equipment of the apartment is full, to my mind. Radio, TV set, comfortable furniture... and Wi-Fi, of course. 
Actually, everything was clean. 
As for Maria, who met us personally, I think she is the best host in my life. She is a very friendly person ready to help you in any situations. Answers to all my questions and hints were timely and useful. 
I wish we could come back once... 
I highly recommend this flat to everybody who wants to get acquainted with Stockholm."
1250227,318011477,2018-09-03T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment is in a nice part of Stockholm. Near to many amenities, but in a gorgeous, quiet street surrounded by embassies. It is a smart area and seems quite exclusive, so those seeking a more bohemian experience may be better heading for Sodermalm. 
All areas within easy walking distance though, including the old town.
Quality, comfortable accommodation, perfect for a couple hoping to explore.
Well recommended."
164448,184775909,2017-08-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia is a great host and she went above and beyond to make sure we had a great stay. As others have noted, there is another room rented out to guests as well but this was no problem for us at all. Although it is a shared house, everything you have a private room that opens to a guest-only living room and bathroom on its own floor, so you can really have your privacy. The location was also great for us. I would highly recommend this place and would definitely return next time we are in Stockholm."
1153177,273753486,2018-06-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Terry was a perfect host. He gave me all the directions from the airport and met me at the metro station when I arrived to show me the way. He put some food in the fridge for us so that we wouldn't have to run around when we arrived.
He was always answering promptly and everything went really smoothly thanks to that. I cannot recommend his place enough!"
299154,15255900,2014-07-06T00:00:00.000Z,"This apartment was in the absolutely best location for our visit! A couple minutes from Slussen train station and boat docks, and it was just over the bridge to the old city. It was very easy to get around to all the museums, archipelago boats, and everything in Gamla Stan. There was also a grocery store on the way from Slussen to the apartment and that was very helpful. 

Daniel really helped us with our trip. Although he was away on a business trip during our stay and we did not meet him personally, he was very responsive to any questions both before the trip and during. He arranged for a friend to be there to meet us and to be able to drop our bags off early before heading out to do some exploring. I was traveling with a work colleague and the apartment has 2 very comfortable beds—one appears to be ‘real’ and other is a couch fold-up that was much more sturdy and comfortable than regular couch pull-outs. 

The apartment is very small. I would say 2 people would be the most comfortable in that small space. There was a lot of Daniel’s stuff around and we had a hard time finding somewhere to put our basic things like toiletries, although there was a wardrobe with hangers. We could not be in the kitchen at the same time. And maybe it was just us and technology, but we could not get the TV to work to see the World Cup. That said, we were not in the apartment very much and having a kitchen for dinners after long days of sightseeing and day trips was terrific. There is a little deck that is lovely in the evenings. I would say if you just need a place to sleep, maybe prepare a couple of meals for some downtime, and want to be close to everything fun in Stockholm, this is a great apartment. Daniel did everything he could to make us feel welcome."
822497,5606457,2013-07-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Moa was an excellent host - the communication was swift, precise and welcoming. And she had put out little notes for us as guides to the flat - and had bought us milk, bread and other small stuff, that made us feel at home.
The flat was very practical for us: a family of five. Very neat and clean. Charming with a balcony where we could eat our meals out. 
The area is a southwestern suburb to Stockholm, but the tubestation is just around the corner - and trains are precise and often. It is a quiet neighbourhood - green and with good grocery shopping, cafées and good ethnique take-aways. People are nice and friendly. It didnt take long before our 10 year old son had found a boy in the area that played football and  played with him and his friends at the local school several times.
Thanks Moa - for a wonderful stay. We will be asking to borrow your flat again next time we are going to Stockholm."
206221,76631075,2016-05-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Elisabeth is one of the best host I have ever met. She is a very kind, warm heated person. She take every step to make us informed and travelled well. Plus she surprised us by serving us the best breakfasts in the morning! Highly recommend:)"
700113,228884135,2018-01-21T00:00:00.000Z,Very clean. Features a kitchenette and TV. This is the perfect set up in that you can be as separate from host Ilona as you wish or ask her for help with anything as she is literally in the flat next door.
974175,214582926,2017-11-26T00:00:00.000Z,"What a wonderful place. We stayed for a couple of nights on the way back to the UK from the north. Lovely apartment, spotlessly clean and a brilliant base for the city. Great communication from our hosts too. Thoroughly recommended."
1182616,6312481,2013-08-07T00:00:00.000Z,peter is a very helpful and flexible person. I was really fine during the period in his house. the room was big and vey clean. I hope to return.
313763,258379880,2018-04-29T00:00:00.000Z,Very nice and confortable apartment in a perfect location in the centre of  Stockholm. Close to a lot of small restaurants from cheap to expensive with most locals. Per is a perfect host.
700113,9076408,2013-12-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Pleasant, clean apartment, nicely decorated. Enjoyed a relaxing stay with Ilona, would return. Excellent location for the town centre and public transport links."
904739,512322856,2019-08-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Menaf’s studio was perfect. He left us fruit, snacks and coffee. It’s nice for a quiet retreat from the city but still close to good food, parks and outdoor activities. He arranged 2 bicycles for us to use. He was also  very helpful after leaving a shirt behind. 
We would definitely stay at his apartment again!"
556363,53013851,2015-11-03T00:00:00.000Z,"We were 4 girls staying in Lennards apartment for 4 nights and it was perfect for us. It looked like described as in the pictures and it is really central. Just across the street you find a metro station which is in the city centre in minutes. You will find supermarkets and restaurants just outside the door and the transport from the airport was really easy. The communication with Lennard was really good as well. 
My friends and I would totally recommend to stay in this apartment in Stockholm! It even would fit more than 4 people easily."
299154,43138371,2015-08-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Daniel was a really great host and gave us a really nice, clean place to stay. He even gave us an earlier check in time after we told him we would be carrying around our backpacks with us in the city. His place was modern and full of the usual amenities you would find at a hotel and more."
145320,268908833,2018-05-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Kim's home is very close to Stockholm, and it was a great place for us to stay in order to quickly reach the city on foot (about 20 min). Our check-in was a bit rough as she forgot to send us the directions to her home, but I believe that we were a special case and that this does not usually happen. The beds were quite comfortable; however, it gets a bit cold at night because the windows and doors in the home are always open. Kim allows guests to use the entire house which is very nice, and her kitchen is the cutest area. Kim is also very kind and friendly. Overall, we enjoyed our experience there and would recommend staying here for a short trip!"
299154,470427810,2019-06-16T00:00:00.000Z,"A small flat, but for an short trip perfect. The communication was very easy, and he was very friendly. The location was amazing."
688947,4552114,2013-05-12T00:00:00.000Z,Alexander is a good host. The flat was very clean and we were free to feel like at home. Great place if you want to rest after a tiring day walking in Stockholm.
1048260,17678564,2014-08-16T00:00:00.000Z,"We really had a great time at Annika's place ! we didn't meet in person, but she made everything to make us feel welcome in her home. Nice location (subway is 5 minutes from home and then you're 2 stations from sodermalm and less than 10 minutes to T Centralen), really nice balcony and everything you might need (especially if you are self catering)."
1137050,21220111,2014-10-13T00:00:00.000Z,"We, my girlfriend and I, had a great time in Stockholm and in Gabriels apartment. Everything worked superfantastic and easy. The apartment is very charming, beautiful and has everything needed. And it was absolutely clean. 
Even though we didn't meet him personaly, the communication with Gabriel was easy, he was obliging, provided all information needed and offered his help."
700113,430827774,2019-03-31T00:00:00.000Z,"Very central, clean and nothing to complain about."

Al piano superiore c'è uno spazio attrezzato con frigorifero, bollitore e microonde a disposizione degli ospiti. Molto comoda la posizione, vicinissima alla fermata del treno e a 5 minuti dalla metro."

916806,413839735,2019-02-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Julia place is a great little studio in the Skärholmen suburb of Stockholm. The T-bana is about a 10minute walk away, making it so easy to get into the city, and the surroundings are beautiful at Skärgården. The place is a little smaller than it perhaps appears in the photos, but fine for a single traveller or a couple who are have the same sleep schedule. It’s not great if you’re a light sleeper - the water pump system is quite noisy, both the one in the studio and from the neighbours upstairs, so bring earplugs if you wake up easily!"
533880,15244021,2014-07-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Fin og central placering.
Vi nød værelset og følte os godt hjemme. 
Venlig modtagelse.
Vi var lidt usikre på dele køkken og bad,men det fungerede bare perfekt.
Og alt i gå afstand var jo perfekt."

610948,6609189,2013-08-19T00:00:00.000Z,"This is a dream apartment in Stockholm! It is spacious and comfortable, and the decor is very stylish yet relaxed at the same time. We also loved the location. Sodermalm itself is a great neighborhood, and it's a pleasant walk from the apartment to Gamla Stan, the old town--or you can easily hop on the metro if you prefer. Lina was very kind and thoughtful; she made sure we had everything we might need for our stay. We had an amazing time in Stockholm, and wish we could have stayed longer in both that magical city and this wonderful apartment."
278311,1438942,2012-06-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Beautiful, clean and quiet place; nice and friendly host. Everything went well and I can really recommend this place for anyone visiting Stockholm. The train and metro stations are really close.
Unfortunately I did not have time to walk around in Farsta Strand, but something for the next time, then.
Thanks, Linnéa!"
164448,91499409,2016-08-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia was very welcoming host.  We felt right at home as soon as we walked in the appartement.  Once settled, Lidia gave us a nice overview of things to do in Stockholm which was very useful.  The location of the appartement is perfect, right next to a train station and walking distance of Götgatan where you can find everything you need.  We had a great time, we would definitively go back to Lidia's place."
442837,14206189,2014-06-14T00:00:00.000Z,"I had a great experience staying at Jo's place. It is right across the block from metro station and also the airport bus stop. There is a shopping mall and other shops also in the same block. The apartment is very spacious and has all the amenities you would require during your stay. The bedroom is small, but you get to use the great living room and kitchen area so the size of bedroom is not an issue at all. Jo was nice to arranged with her mother to give keys to me on my arrival day since she had to be away for work. Both her mother and Joanna are very helpful and nice and were eager to give any information regarding the city and my stay here.
Highly recommended!"

Edwin went out if his way to help us (even with the laundry) and gave us tips on Stockholm. The room is perfect, clean and the bed is very comfy. The flat is super tidy clean and you can even use the kitchen. The flat is in a safe area and very central located. It is above a shopping center with various stores incl groceries and three min walk to karlaplan metro.. 
We stayed twice during our sweden vacation in Edwin flat and highly recommend to everyone!"

There, you can take the underground to Mariatorget, which is just two minutes walking to the apartment. Once there, you'll find out that the apartment is located in a lively and nice area that is walking distance to the city centre.
The apartment itself is very cosy and welcoming, and it has even more than you could expect, as it is Mallika's own home. She was away on holiday when we stayed there, so we didn't meet her, but she was available by (Hidden by Airbnb) all the time."

Vannie and Andreas did everything to make me feel comfortable and at home. They were so helpful and friendly. They are also very interesting and nice people. 
The apartment and the room are great, it is very nice having your own bathroom.

And his place was roomy, comfortable, well appointed, and perfect for our needs (2 adults and 3 kids under 14). It allowed walking access to Djurgarden and Gamlastan, and easy access to the subways as well. The neighborhood was quiet and people we met there were friendly. We'd stay again for sure!"

Area is surrounded by heaps of parkland, restaurants and shopping. Room has a lovely little balcony that is great to have breakfast on in the morning.
Peter was a great host, more than willing to help with any requests.
Another couple were staying in the other room but they were excellent housemates, no concerns whatsoever. 
We would highly recommend Peter's apartment for anyone to stay."

I got tips on where I could shop for food near the apartment and which restaurants we could eat at. She even got on the subway to pick us up to show the way to the apartment when we arrived. 

The apartment was clean and towels were provided. The bed was big and very good to sleep in. There was no noise even with the window open at night.

608672,473295080,2019-06-21T00:00:00.000Z,Exactly how the apt is described.  We really enjoyed the neighborhood.  Our favorite breakfast spot was Gost — go check it out!
259722,274416587,2018-06-09T00:00:00.000Z,"It's a beautiful place in laps of nature. It's nearby to Kista Galleria and just opposite to Kista Park. So it's an ideal place if you love peace and nature. Metro station, restraunts, pubs... Everything is nearby. The apartment is beautiful and equipped with all necessary amenities. I enjoyed my stay and recommend each and everyone to check this place if living in Kista."

916806,195034352,2017-09-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Julia's flat is perfect for a short or medium stay in Stockholm. The view from the terrace is amazing and gets you into the Swedish mood when you step outside. As a host, Julia and her husband are fast to answer to questions (like we that had problems opening the door - our own fault) and offer help.

The flat has everything needed and is optimal for 2 persons. There is a bus stop close by and the metro (take a 24 or 72 hour or a ticket for one week - it saves money) is either a walk or a short drive away (if you don't want to go uphill you can park at Skärholmen center for 50 SEK a day - very cheap). 

Talking about parking. It is easy to get guest parking from Julia. For us we had some problems because of a second car from our son that visited from Norway. The app for parking is not available on (Hidden by Airbnb) Play when you have a non Swedish phone. But you can find the APK from the parking company online ( (Hidden by Airbnb) ) and solve the problem with installing manually (just a tip).

We love Stockholm and the area around and when we come back we will look into this flat again. Highly recommended. Thanks for having us."

The area is very quiet and clean, with nice cafés and a wonderfull bakery, the next supermarket is just around the corner. Mallika was very friendly and everything looked exactly as on the photos.

I was a little nervous because this was my first time using Airbnb, but she made me feel right at home.  The apartment is clean and neat, and the furnishings are very warm and inviting.  The kitchen and bedroom have a great view of the bay and the cruise terminal – it doesn’t get any better than breakfast with a view!  I didn’t use the kitchen much, but it seems very well-equipped and modern, and it has a great coffee maker.  The bathroom has sufficient counter space, and the shower has great water pressure.  Wifi was speedy.  The apartment is located in a quiet residential area, and it is within walking distance of the bus and t-bana (underground).  I would definitely recommend this room, and I would love to stay here again if I come back someday!"

в которой была бы не модная современная обстановка, а настоящий шведский стиль и домашний уют.
эта квартира полностью оправдала наши ожидания! 
а забота хозяина, сделала пребывание мега комфортным и позволила иначе взглянуть на Стокгольм.
надеюсь вернуться осенью, чтобы насладиться красотой парков и такой изменчивой погоды-)"

There was only a problem when we arrived. Because some friends showed me the neighbourhood and walked me to Barb’s house, Barb got disturbed and did not provide the key to the appartement. Wich is a pity because I had to text everytime I was going back to the room ! Too bad that I had to give her all my official documents in order to reassure her that I and my friend are not a risk for her. Anyways, it could have stopped at this, but she told me that she had to call the police, which is not a problem for me because i felt secured.
After this little problem, barb was polite and offered us tea and coffee and she let us use the kitchen."

They are a charming, warm, friendly, and engaging couple who make you feel very much at home. They are also extremely discreet and respectful people. They take the time to meet you and get to know you. That makes a trip a little special. We were extremely gratified to arrive at the apartment with a very well stocked larder and fridge. During our four day stay there was very little we needed to buy in the way of provisions, which was a real bonus and very much appreciated. We received immediate replies on the few queries we raised. I even got a weather update and words of support from Thomas the day before I ran in the Stockholm Marathon, which again was much appreciated. 
The apartment is in an idyllic location, being located near a beautiful lake, with an historic cafe/restaurant just a few minutes walk away. There is also another cafe located by the lake just 15 minutes walk away. The lake is definitely worth a walk/jog around. The bus stop is just a few minutes walk away, with the buses running frequently to Fruängen metro station. The walk to the station is pleasant and takes around 20-25 minutes. So you can definitely get to the centre of Stockholm in 30-40 minutes. 
We were a party of 4 and were accommodated comfortably.
We can't recommend this lovely apartment enough."

The couple is very sweet and helpful, helped me with all the bus numbers, routes and timings. Vidhatri ji made me the indian stuffed bread in breakfast, which was just delicious as any of the best indian restaurant. It was most comfortable stay. Even when I had to catch the bus at 2 am , Bala ji helped me finding the bus stop at that awkward time, which is so nice of him.

It is an easy walk from two different metro station- no more than 10 minutes.  If you want to walk down to the water or to old town you can walk it in about 30 minutes. And very easy to get to and from the airport as you can take the city metro or the Arlanda express.  The flat is close to grocery stores and great restaurants.  We walked everywhere from the flat.   You can easily get to all of the sites from here. The studio is large enough for two people and is very quiet.  There are lots of nice touches -  even a lint brush and snacks!  We loved it and I would definitely stay here again.  There is also a lovely park across the street.  Overall it was a great place to stay.

975364,316042661,2018-08-30T00:00:00.000Z,Max is a nice host. He wasn't there often but if we had some question he always replied quickly. The flat is very central in Södermalm. There are bus stations and a metro station near by. The kitchen is the heart of the flat. There you have much space to prepare and enough place to sit and eat or enjoy with some tea. In the bedroom you also have much space. The bed is big but there is only one blanket. You have a couch but it isn't very clean. The closet is big enough for two people but very dusty on the ground. The room door is very loud and the curtains are transparent so it was very bright in the room every morning. The bathroom ist really small. The shower is very nice but after you took a shower the whole ground is wet. For us it was very practical to have a supermarket near by :)
776012,92228131,2016-08-08T00:00:00.000Z,"The appartment is very nice with a great view. We enjoy localisation that can't be better. Majken provided us good advises.
Great place to stay in Stockholm !"
1153177,7461616,2013-09-21T00:00:00.000Z,"We were three on a business trip and stay at Terry's apartment. Terry is very friendly, helpful and welcoming. Terry very surprised us when we arrive,  he prepare dinner four us. The apartment is very nice, bright, clean, spacious and well equipped. It is located in a quiet part of Stockholm. The apartment is near T-Ban station from which you can easily and promptly reach your destination. 
Excellent place to stay in Stockholm, we highly recommend Terry's apartment!"
873383,43489118,2015-08-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Isabelle et Dan ont été des hôtes fantastique, voir l'hôte parfait. Je suis partit seul en vacances à Stockholm pendant 12 jours. Isabelle a toujours été là pour me conseiller:
-quelles activités je pouvais faire 
-quels lieux à visiter. 
Dès que je posait une question elle s'empressait de se renseigner si le lieu était ouvert, si oui combien était l'entrer etc. etc.

De plus, elle m'a proposer de l'accompagner à plusieurs reprise afin de prendre un \"Fika\" (\"apéro\") avec ces amis. 

L'appartement, en plus d'être très propre et bien équipés (TV, wifi, netflix etc..) il est aussi très bien situé, à une centaine de mètre de la station de métro. Il faut compter environ 15-20 min jusqu'au centre de Stockholm. Chaque matin Isabelle proposait un copieux déjeuner, selon les envies que je pouvais avoir. 

Je ne peux que recommander Isabelle si vous souhaitez avoir un séjour à Stockholm. C'est l'hôte idéal qui fait tout pour que l'on se sente à l'aise et chez soit :)"

Die Lage auf Kungsholmen ist sehr gut und gleich um die Ecke gibt es einen guten Bäcker und ein guten Italiener.
Ich kann die Wohnung von Mikael wärmstens empfehlen!"
916806,253135107,2018-04-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Joli studio au rez-de-chaussée dans un joli quartier de petites maisons colorées. Nous avons particulièrement aimé l’équipement du studio et la réactivité de notre hôte, même si nous ne l’avons pas rencontrée. Ils n’étaient pas là et nous avons fait un self check-out qui s’est très bien déroulé. Petit bémol pour le quartier aux alentours du métro qui n’est pas très accueillant ainsi que pour le bruit à chaque utilisation de l’eau. Si vous êtes sensibles à la lumière le matin prenez des cache-yeux, car le soleil se lève très tôt et il y a beaucoup de lumière le matin."
1182616,107784677,2016-10-12T00:00:00.000Z,Peter went way above and beyond. I left my suit at his apartment and he contacted my friend's uncle as well as delivered the suit to this uncle so he could deliver it to me in Malmö.
533880,3042315,2012-12-08T00:00:00.000Z,"I stayed at Jarl's room for two days during a business visit to Stockholm. The location is very nice, close to public transport and just a couple of minutes away from nice restaurants, bars, shops etc. Even though my flight was delayed Jarl made it possible for me to arrive in the middle of the night. Thanks again for that! The bed was comfortable, clean bathroom and Jarl is a great host and company."

1248490,16823374,2014-08-03T00:00:00.000Z,"We've been delighted by our stay at Maria's home. The place is very well located, 10 mn from the metro, next to nytorget, which is the lovely central place of the famous area of SoFo. There are everything at hand reach: restaurants, shops, supermarket opened 8-22, playgrounds for kids.
The apartment is comfortable and perfect for a family.
Maria was very welcoming and we would definitely come back there if we go to Stockholm again with our two boys."

The house is very nice and clean and has a lovely garden.
It is located in a quiet neighborhood with the metro and supermarket within just a few minutes walk.  
The host,Jacob was very kind and friendly.
He prepared a lot of toys for my daughter,and first breakfast,welcome us.
We were able to spend a fun time thanks to his help.
I thought I was good to choose his house.
We want to go Stockholm and his house again soon!"

la localisation était bonne, très facile d’accès par les transports en commun. Le studio contenait tout ce qu’il faut. Le seul bémol rapporté par mes parents qui ont occupé le logement est que le lit était un peu trop étroit (120cm) ce qui pour 2 est un peu juste."
871262,6697113,2013-08-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Lotta has a wonderful apartment in the heart of Stockholm.  There are plenty of cafes and restaurants in the area, as well as easy access to the public transit network.  Lotta was a very flexible host and was very helpful in offering suggestions on the city.

688947,21303557,2014-10-14T00:00:00.000Z,"I and my dad visited Stockholm for a few days and had the chance to stay at Alex's place. His apartment is definitely as pictured in the description, peaceful, clean and very well-located since there's only about 20 minutes to get to the centre town ! Alex is a friendly guy, he gave us some tips and as I told him, he's a great promoter of Sweden ;) Besides, he's a fine music connoisseur, which highlighted for sure his apartment's great vibes. I highly recommend him !"

The location of the apartment is very close to the central area of the city. It's just a 10mins walk to old town. 
Bed and bathroom were clean and totally suffient. The room was a little bit light and you could hear some noise from the street, but we didn't have a huge problem with that. I guess only people that are sensible might have some issues with that. 
We felt very comfortable all the time and Barb was also providing us some leftovers for breakfast. 
We had a nice time, thanks again Barb!"
259722,322939380,2018-09-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Marcelo is a wonderful host. He is very professional with allocating the space you need for your groceries, laundry, trash, etc. and labeling them. It makes you feel very comfortable. The room isn't big but's it's perfectly reasonable for a single tennant. I's right as pictured, with a wardrobe and studying table. The lighting is very good, many different lamps and the room gets good amount of sunlight. Since it's ground level it's easy to access. It's located very good as well, one bus stop or 6 minutes walk from Kinsta centrum, where there's subway and all the stuff you need; great shopping center. From there you can go to city center or anywhere else you want thrpugh public transport. There's also a park nearby the house. Good location, great host, perfectly clean and tidy house... Definitely recommended."
299154,309595632,2018-08-18T00:00:00.000Z,I can highly recommend Daniel's flat. The location is superb. The flat is very cosy and has a cute balcony. The streets around have lovely cafe and shops and you are in very close to a central underground station. You can walk into old city and are in the middle of trendy area. Daniel is quick in responding and very helpful. We would definately come and stay again. Thanks for everything!
819676,454980965,2019-05-19T00:00:00.000Z,"The location is the best part, as it is very close to Slussen tunnelbana. Also, the room and private bathroom are at the entrance of the apartment so you can come in and go out, without disturbing the hosts. Comfortable little room with a great heated bathroom."
974175,115916376,2016-11-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Sofie was welcoming from the moment we booked this stunning apartment - she helped us with recommendations for places to eat & drink, even shop and she was there to welcome us/show us around her stylish apartment on arrival. Everything we wanted and needed was there, Sofie even left us some milk in the fridge, she was super thoughtful! We loved this apartment, it was even better than the listing had suggested, beds were extremely comfortable and the kitchen gadgets had us gasping in awe - such a great find! 
Highly rated places to visit/eat/drink - The Brunch Club, Phil's Burgers, The illuminated Reindeer at Nybroplan, Vasa Museum, Svenskt Tenn for a pot of tea and a great shopping experience, Lagerhaus for discount homewares and curious gift ideas, Fotografiska in Södermalm at night followed by dinner at Meatballs for The People, Pharmarium for a crazy cocktails in Gamla Stan, Coffee at johan & nyström, Breakfast pastries at Fabrique (many different bakeries around the City to sample their treats!) - it snowed too, so we got to wear our snowboots and enjoy a cram-packed long weekend in Stockholm! 
This apartment has great wifi access, comfy beds, a homely living room of which we enjoyed watching Netflix and curled up under blankets one evening, the bathroom is a joy to shower in (even towels and hairdryer was provided), the kitchen is well stocked and we loved drinking wine from the glasses provided - a well- thought out apartment/home. The artwork is great to look at and the addition of a new fire burner was welcomed - we didn't use it in the end, but Sofie showed us how to use it if we fancied a real fire - a very unexpected & pleasant addition!
Thank you so much to our hosts, we didn't want to leave! If you are looking for somewhere to stay in Stockholm, this couldn't be rated highly enough - it's easy to get to/explore from, a great base to explore a fun City!"
242188,6273050,2013-08-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia is a great host -very sweet and friendly! It was really great to have a separate large bathroom for guests on the 2nd floor where the rooms are located, plus a fridge and area for preparing coffee & tea in a common living room area. Thanks for the additional travel advice and free maps and allowing me to stay longer in the afternoon due to an evening flight!"
897584,7890783,2013-10-07T00:00:00.000Z,"I stayed at Viveka's place with a friend for a couple of days. She has been very helpful, superfriendly and welcoming. Her apartment was very clean and comfortable and she did a lot of effort to arrange everything we needed. The huge patio and the park right in front of it where also a big plus to relax in the sun after a long day of sightseeing and running around the city. All of that combined made our trip just awesome and unforgettable. A big thank you to a perfect host! Till next time."
338470,989514,2012-03-11T00:00:00.000Z,"This place was great! Perfect for anyone who likes art. Very close to metro, 10-minute walk to trendy / hip restaurants and bars area. 

Gustaf is a very nice and charming host. He gave us handpicked guide and made some useful notes. I will definitely recommend this place to my friends!"

Though we did not meet Cecilia was super helpful with good comms throughout my stay and superb directions to get me there in the first place.

Recommend."
368952,1651516,2012-07-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Stockholm is a beautiful city with soooo much to see and do.  Madeleine became family almost instantly.  She is truly an openhearted and loving person, not to mention a fantastic host.
My son and I had a wonderful time at her place and great conversations regarding the world and Sweden.
I can hardly wait to come back and visit my new friend."
533880,5801169,2013-07-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Jarl left me the best bread I ever had in Sweden! Although I didn't meet him, he arranged everything perfectly and answered all my questions about getting around, laundry, etc, promptly. The room was clean and spacious and only a 5 minute Metro ride to the old town. There's a 7-11 at the corner for your late night ice cream craving and a good cheap Thai takeaway 5 minutes walk away. If you know how expensive things are in Sweden, you'll know this is a Godsend. Last but not least, the shower is hot and has strong water pressure. The apartment has a good feel about it. I highly recommend it."
1124388,71027523,2016-04-23T00:00:00.000Z,"This host was very nice, a very good welcome the day of our arrival. A lot of catalogs of what to do in Stockholm and in its nearest areas in different languages. The island were is the accomodation, is a bit far from the center but there is still buses to go, and by walking there is a beautiful point of view (if we follow the mälaren sea) of stockholm and the city hall (very nice with the sunset). There is everything necessary in the appartment, even a vinyl reader to listen ABBA for example"
875505,267895805,2018-05-23T00:00:00.000Z,Very conveniently located Appartment (10 walking min to central station) with laundry machine and dryer inside the apartment.
302496,1504713,2012-06-18T00:00:00.000Z,"We came to Stockholm with four adults and our small son and the accommodation Seta and Göran offered us could not have been better. They gave us a warm welcome in their wonderful spacious and bright apartment and prepared everything so nicely for our one week stay in Stockholm. The two were very helpful and willing to answer all our questions. I especially loved their collections of modern artworks and literature as well as the antiquated elevator of the house, too. 
You can find plenty restaurants, at least three supermarkets, a nice bakery, a kiosk or a bank branch in the closest neighborhood, so that the everyday requirements could easily be satisfied. Several bus lines with stops right in front of the house connect you directly to the city center.
We thank Seta and Göran very much for everything and not least because of them we will keep fond memories of Stockholm."
1212891,80265251,2016-06-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud was a very good host. She had maps and books and showed what we wanted to see. The room is cosy and very fresh, like in the picture. She kept the cats out of the room which was good because i was allergic, but didn't feel it. Another plus was that she had towels for free and schampoo etc was also free to use. clear and easy instructions. I do really recommend Maud! Thank you!"
1182616,241465159,2018-03-09T00:00:00.000Z,"We had no trouble finding Peter’s accommodation.  Public transport was easy, 3 blocks from metro and bus top was around the corner.  We reached city hall using bus no 3. Vasa museum and Gamla Stan was easily reached via public transport. Peter was nice enough to buy a weight scale so that we won’t have a problem in the airport with heavy luggage.  I used the kitchen for cooking breakfast eggs.  Grocery and restaurants were all around. All in all a good stay and very responsive host.  I would not hesitate renting this space again."
299154,352348841,2018-11-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Daniel was beyond accommodating and helpful for check in and helping us store bags. His place is in the PERFECT location from the metro station being a block away to old town being within a 10 minute walk! There is a great brewery even a block away. Just loved the location! (Get the 24 or 72 hr transit pass and you can catch a metro or bus from within of a block of his place to anywhere, saves time and money for sure)"
206221,465269378,2019-06-07T00:00:00.000Z,The host canceled this reservation 10 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
541875,15076863,2014-07-01T00:00:00.000Z,"I booked Martin's apartment with less than a day's notice and he was very accommodating and even provided someone to pick me up at the station and bring me back to the flat; however, a major issue arose and Martin's handling of the situation was at first, understanding, but then quickly turned immature and unreasonable. After the second evening I found BED BUGS. I had a simple itch after my first night, but I attributed it to maybe a food allergy because I ate a lot of fish. After the second evening the bites were all over my arms and body and I stayed at a friend's apartment. I returned to Martin's flat in the morning and found, in the sheets, a dead bed bug. I immediately called and texted Martin and sent him photos of the dead bed bug and the 70+ bites on my body. I left the dead bug in his flat for evidence. He called an apologized and stated this never happened before and I understand that things happen. We discussed potential solutions and he seemed open to talk; however, after I requested a refund he denied it and acted immature and kept saying that I brought the bugs and there are no bugs in his place. He also stated that it was inconvenient for his friend to pick up the keys at my hotel. Really? I'm sure that is WAY more inconvenient than having your body eaten alive by bed bugs. My stay in Stockholm was completely compromised and miserable and I had to spend an extra amount of money to stay in a hotel, cover my medical costs, and do laundry. I was sleeping most of the time due to the antihistamines and when I was awake I was constantly fighting the urge to itch my entire body. I have disputed the charge on my American Express and have asked them to step in. Martin has good reviews and I understand things happen, but I judge a host on how they handle a bad situation and Martin failed miserably with this issue. This should have been a very simple thing to refund my money and call it a day, but he denied by saying it's not his fault and I'm the one who brought the bugs. I would NOT recommend staying in his flat. You can stay at the Elite Hotel Stockholm which is downtown, provides a free breakfast and is only about $30 or so more expensive than Martin's apartment that has paint peeling off the walls and, during my stay, was infested with bed bugs. Rent at your own risk. My stay was June 25th to the 30th for 5 nights, but I left after the second night due to the bugs."
368952,105237548,2016-10-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Ich habe vom 15. August bis zum 30.September bei Madeleine gewohnt. Meine Unterkunft war ein umgebautes Gartenhaus, ca. 20m² groß. Es gab zwei Herdplatten, eine Mikrowelle, Besteck und Geschirr. Allerdings nur eine Art Plumpsklo, keine Dusche und kein fließend Wasser. Für eine Dusche, oder um die Wassergefäße zu füllen, musste ich in das Haupthaus, indem Madeleine mit ihrem Sohn, ihrem Hund und ihrer Katze lebt. Des Weiteren muss man relativ weit zu Fuß zur nächsten Bushaltestelle gehen (10min). Das Gartenhaus ist gemütlich, direkt am Wald und sauber. Da ich auch einen Schlüssel in das Haupthaus hatte, war Duschen, Abspülen etc. kein größeres Problem. Das Internet war sehr schlecht, auch die Ausstattung erschien mir etwas sporadisch. Also insgesamt mehr ein Camping-Erlebnis, aber das ist ja nicht schlecht. Madeleine ist eine sehr nette Person, sie hat mir den Aufenthalt sehr angenehm gestaltet (ich konnte zum Beispiel mein Auto noch zwei Tage länger auf dem Grundstück parken)"
242188,76294867,2016-05-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia is so lovely and kind, a great resource of excellent information about the city and very attentive to your comfort. I'd highly recommend! The location is ideal, with easy access to all the cool spots Sodermalm has to offer, plus proximity to public transport to easily reach city highlights that are further away."

We were picked up from the metro and given hints and tips about Stockholm as well as invited to try some Pakistani breakfast! 
It proboably takes about 20 minutes from the main station by metro. We would recommend the place for 2 people. 
Thanks for these comfortable three nights, 
Klara, Elena & Lisa"
581243,49302246,2015-10-02T00:00:00.000Z,Edwin is a c very good host. And i will definitely book his room if I come to Stockholm again.

343925,5634970,2013-07-09T00:00:00.000Z,Our stay in Stockholm was amazing and a great share of it was due to Annika's super cozy flat and wonderful hospitality. The apt was clean and equipped with everything one needs to feel at home away from home. We were very suprised that Annika even picked us up from the train station and then took her time to tell us a lot about the city and where to go. Would definitely recommend to stay with her!
1119738,17087242,2014-08-07T00:00:00.000Z,Nice house with free parking 10 minutes from metro. Ideal for families visiting Stockholm with a car. And Anna is a great host. Recommended.

819676,315990608,2018-08-30T00:00:00.000Z,"I usually do not write reviews about air bnb I stayed. However, this place was wonderful in many aspects. First of all, it was very easy to communicate with the host and access to his place. Even though I needed to check-in a bit early, he helped me to check in and bring my luggage in. Secondly, it was only 5 min walk away from Slussen stn., so there was no need to spend lot of energy finding the accommodation. The size of the room was little bit smaller than I expected, but enough for single person, and wonderful view from the room and private toilet explained everything. If you are considering to stay at this place, I definitely recommend it so don't miss it!"
536283,5733048,2013-07-14T00:00:00.000Z,"While we never met Paolo in person, he was very friendly and communicative over email and text. His apartment is in a perfect location--right in the middle of all of the action in Sodermalm, but enough off the main drag to be relatively quiet on busy weekend nights when you'll inevitably have the windows open to stay cool. It is a short walk to the subway and main ferry terminals, and a pleasant walk to the Old City (Gamla Stan).

The kitchen is well equipped, and there's a grocery a block away, a movie theater, as well as many trendy, nice restaurants and shops (Sardin, Sneakersnstuff, etc.) nearby. The apartment is simple, but bright and comfortable. Paolo was kind enough to lend us olive oil for cooking and to not blink an eye when a windy evening blew over and broke his plant pot (sorry about that!). We would definitely return to Paolo's!"
1132208,47358443,2015-09-18T00:00:00.000Z,"The communication with Emma was easy and simple. Her flat is really nice and it´s easy to travel with public transport. I went for a jogging trip twice, there is a beautiful small island just close to the flat and it was great. 
There is everything in the kitchen you need. So I can definitely recommend her place!!!"
897584,17595146,2014-08-14T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a lovely 3-days stay at Viveka's very charming flat - a comfortable, quiet, well equipped and well decorated place just a few minutes away from the metro. We hope to be back soon!"
608672,18887225,2014-09-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Wonderful experience!  Karl was a great host, giving us some good 'insider' tips, providing a map for our usage, and letting us arrive early on a Sunday morning.  The apartment has everything you could need - tea and coffee, hair dryer, and even an iron!  The bed was the comfiest I slept in during my 2-week trip.  Spotlessly clean.  Neighborhood was very cozy and just next to the main shopping drag."
581243,65635545,2016-03-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Really great experience in Stockholm. Edwin's instructions were very clear & the place was at a very accessible location in a nice, friendly neighbourhood on top of a shopping mall (with restaurants and grocery retailers inside). Would come back if I were to visit the city again!"

242188,49336926,2015-10-03T00:00:00.000Z,"This place worked out well. It was about 5 minutes from the commuter train (handy for coming from main train station in Stockholm) and 10 to 15 minutes to the Metro (a bus stop was closer if you preferred.) It's also about 15 minutes to walk to SoFo, Stockholm's hipster area, if you like trendy restaurants etc. There is also a street that is closed to traffic that has fashion clothing stores like Gina Tricot (similar to H&M), about 15 to 20 minutes walking distance.

The room was small but cozy and comfortable. There are other rooms so you will meet other guests and hear their them in the shared common area but overall that wasn't an issue. 

Lidia was very helpful with maps and suggestions of things to do, and tips about public transit."
647314,122244406,2016-12-22T00:00:00.000Z,great place in a very hipster-cool part of town. mallika was very helpful in helping us get to her place and around town and her two cats are very cute and happy to socialise. would recommend

The room was comfortable and clean, and the location was very good, next to the subway and a 10-15 minute walk from the center.
The bathroom, though small, was ok.
My husband and I enjoyed our stay and would go back for sure.
Thanks, Karl! :)"
1124388,4852953,2013-05-28T00:00:00.000Z,The flat is exactly how it is described. Lovely and cosy. Great location. We really enjoyed the walk into the city centre. I would definitely recommend Carl's place. Thanks for the breakfast it made a nice start to the day!

442837,4720826,2013-05-21T00:00:00.000Z,"This was my first trip with Aribnb, and it was wonderful. But you all know that already. So, few words about Jo's apartment: first of all, Jo helped me with all the travel details, itinerary, etc., that made it easy to find my way around. The apartment is in a good location well connected to major transport arteries. Downtown just 10 min by metro. The flat itself is very cozy, warm, with lots of light, and you have your privacy. Jo is a great host who loves traveling herself! A recommended shelter."
259025,8053741,2013-10-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Ali is a kind hearted person. The house is warm and quiet but a little bit far away from the center. If you choose to leave here, it is highly recommended buy a 24 hours ticket. Please ask the ticket office about the address when you get off the subway to void missing."

1182616,9435236,2013-12-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Peter was out of town, but he has a great way of transferring keys to arriving guests. There was another set of guests in the flat, but it is definitely big enough to be no problem. We never ended up meeting Peter, but he is a nice host, and even left some chocolate for us! 
The only problem that I could see is that we couldn't figure out how to lock our door when we went out (but maybe we just didn't get something), so un-trusting guests might prefer to take there valuables with them..."
1124388,64280583,2016-03-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Le logement de Carl est sur une petite île tranquille à stockholm facilement accessible en autobus. Il y a une épicerie juste en face ce qui est très pratique.

Carl a été un excellent hôte. Avant notre arrivée il a toujours été disponible pour répondre à nos questions sur stockholm. À notre arrivée le logement était impeccable et il a partagé avec nous beaucoup d'informations sur la ville. Il nous a laissé un carte avec les attractions principales et nous a bien expliqué le fonctionnement des lieux.

Le logement est cosy et à été parfait pour 3 personnes. Le lit supplémentaire était très confortable. La cuisine chez Carl est très bien équipée pour des gens qui désirent faire à manger en voyage. Carl nous a également laisser les essentiels pour cuisiner (huile, épices etc.) ainsi que café et thé pour le petit déjeuner. 

Je recommande fortement le logement de Carl et y retournerai avec plaisir à ma prochaine visite à stockholm."

La casa es amplia y confortable. Y el barrio es muy tranquilo.
Estas a 20 minutos andando del centro y con la parada de metro Stadium a 2 minutos."

This is a lovely, comfortable and quiet apartment in an excellent location for reaching the centre of Stockholm on the metro (2-3 stops). It has everything you could need including an all mod cons designer kitchen, and laundry facilities. There are shops nearby, and we went to 2 great very local restaurants (Stockholm Brunch Club and Smorgastarteriet). Highly recommended"
1124388,62237094,2016-02-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Appartement très bien situé et très pratique car proche des transports.
Notre hôte à été très arrangeant pour les horaires d'arrivés dans l'appartement.

1212891,27445937,2015-03-04T00:00:00.000Z,"My mom and I would like to thank Maud for the warm welcome. We were exhausted in our trip since we visited Stockholm for 2 days only, arrived in the evening and left early! Overall, Maud is very accommodating and totally a good host. She has kept her place tidy and organized! She has clear instruction and house rules which were very friendly and easy to follow, of course in order to keep her place neat for the next guests. Maud also provide maps and some useful tips, I would recommend to install 'stay' app as it helps us navigate the city - good for tourist really! The walk from Maud's place from the metro station is at least 10 mins, if that helps."

608672,17511302,2014-08-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Karl was a great host and the apartment was nice. There was a nice bed and a tv, along with a private bathroom and kitchen. Karl even helped us do laundry partway through our stay, and gave us a jar of delicious caviar as a treat. The only challenge was a small shower that required some floor squeegee-ing. Other than that, we had a great stay."
1182616,33626971,2015-05-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Abbiamo prenotato una stanza per tre e il terzo letto era un materasso per terra, rendendo anche difficile i movimenti nella stanza. La camera era poco pulita, un sacco di polvere sulle mensole; sporchi anche bagno e cucina. Infine nell'appartamento ci sono tre stanze da tre persone ognuna, ma un solo bagno. Non lo consigliamo."
1124388,6201152,2013-08-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice little appartement, on a pretty little island.
Everything you need is there, and Carl e-mailed us all the details.
He even let us use a free city bike card (which is a must have in Stockholm). Bikes are available next to the bus stop, cards are sold a little bit further tho.

The island is cool and quiet, you can jogg around it, and even swimm if the water is not too cold!

Too bad we didn't have a chance to meet Carl, but i recommend him as a host, as everything went fine!"

Nevertheless, the neighborhood is calm and offers a lot of green spots, even if the city centre is in walking distance. Probably one of the best adresses to be in Sweden's capital!"
608672,13352504,2014-05-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Karl hat uns sehr herzlich empfangen. Er hat sich Zeit genommen, uns einige Sachen Stockholms zu erklären. Als wir ankamen, war es sehr heiss. Karl hat uns eine grosse Flasche Wasser in den Kühlschrank gestellt. Das war sehr nett.
Das einzige, was uns gestört hat, war die Dusche. Das Bad war anschliessend überflutet. Aber wenn man bedenkt, dass diese Location sehr zentral ist, nimmt man das Bad auch in Kauf."
628555,264070116,2018-05-13T00:00:00.000Z,The location of the property is very good and on the best metro line (Red) for all the sights and main neighborhoods.

But when I saw the room and the flat my concerns were gone. Everything was like shown in the pictures and Jarl was a good host, even though he wasn't there all the time. He is a really nice person and answered to my questions by mail very fast. The flat was clean and I felt in good hands. Thank you for that, Jarl, I will definitively do airnbnb again!

Everything you could possibly need was available ( including an excellent Indian restaurant in the apartment block!). We had space to hang clothes, a comfortable bed, the balcony would have been lovely (had it ever stopped raining!) and the public transport links from the local bus stop and metro station were perfect - straight to central Stockholm. Should we visit again, I would have no hesitation in asking Magnus to be our host . Highly recommended - and next time it would be great to meet too!"

It was also great having two bathrooms.  The house had everything you need, including a washing machine and dryer and overall was comfortable.  Dany was extremely helpful before our stay providing tips for our visit and advice about various attractions.  His instructions for finding the house and to get to and from the tube were really good and overall, he could not have been a more helpful host.  Thank you Dany."

As other reviewers wrote, there’s no shower curtain so be prepared for everything to get wet. I didn’t receive any check in instructions so it was hard to find the apartment at first and get the keys, but it’s in a nice location with a subway stop close by."

We got a perfect and quick explanation how to reach the flat from the airport.
We got a warm welcome from the owner Gabriel and he showed us directly all rooms and how to use the facilities. Everything was cleaned and in good order and condition. Gabriel was very polite and friendly!
From our point of view was Gabriel's flat the perfect place to live in the center of SoFo, we loved it!
We didn't see the neighborhood and we didn't hear them at all. The nights were  really quiet, which surprised us for such an area, and bright for a German. :o)
Our conclusion: We loved to stay in SoFo, we like to come back and just in Gabriel's flat of course!  --Many thanks again--"

The home is a real gem and we took away some great ideas for home decor. 
The area is very quiet and most of Stockholm's sights can be reached within 45 minutes , we barely needed public transport. 
Internet was great and we appreciated the Apple TV with Netflix for some relaxed evenings. 
I stayed in the \"children room\" and my parents in the main bedroom-both were fantastic.

It is located in a really nice part of the city, with a great Mexican restaurant down the street, a lovely café not far from that and a short walk to the nearest metro station. 

One concern we had, travelling with a small child, was about accessibility - but it wasn't a problem, since the apartment building has an elevator. The apartment is also quite child-friendly and safe."

The apartment had everything I needed. Good location for walking around Stockholm. I didn't use public transport because it wasn't necessary. Really recommend Sima's loft. 
Stockholm is really beautiful city."

688947,6731622,2013-08-23T00:00:00.000Z,Alexandre`s apartment is in a quiet and beautiful district of Stockholm. We stayed there for three nights and we totally recommend his appartment if you are going to visit splendid Stockholm! :)

700113,13908432,2014-06-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Anfitriã simpática. Vale a ressalva de ser uma suíte compartilhada dentro de seu apartamento, e não dois apartamentos separados como sugere o anúncio. As fotos lhe darão uma impressão de ser maior do que realmente é, mas é realmente confortável e bem equipado. 
A localização também permite que vc conheça tudo a pé, embora fique a duas quadras do metrô para distâncias maiores.
Pelo preço da estadia, vale a pena numa cidade cara para este fim."
1170027,35501368,2015-06-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Very clean apartment, well furnished, 5-6 minuts from metro which is 12 stops (20 minuts) from central station.
Quiet neighborhood, not lively but for the price it's a better value than hotels (which are expensive in Stockholm).
Excellent contact with Diana.

Recommended!"
1212891,48716199,2015-09-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud was a truly wonderful host! She was as experienced with AirBnB as you can get. She had notes everywhere, towels ready to go, water on the bedside table, Stockholm travel book on table, etc. She has a great system for checking in and out where you can come any time using a code. She is very friendly and easy-going and makes you feel very welcomed in her home. 

This was our first visit to Stockholm and Maud's place initially caught our eye because of her relatively very low price to others, even though she's on the outskirts of the city. Because we didn't know the area, we didn't realize that we'd be taking taxis/ubers/the Metro to get back and forth to the City and Gamla Stan so frequently, and that it probably would have been the same if not less expensive to stay in a more central location. It's something to consider and research ahead of time and take into consideration with the price when planning your trip. 

However we have no regrets staying with Maud and really enjoyed meeting her and staying with her in Stockholm! She is by far the most professional and organized host we have stayed with yet using this site."
1182616,9513710,2013-12-31T00:00:00.000Z,"A really cosy accomodation, in a really nice and confortable flat. It has been really nice staying at Peter's: he's really good at organizing the hosting in a really smart way!"
1303522,35341725,2015-06-17T00:00:00.000Z,Cosy and quiet studio flat in a really nice area of Södermalm. Camilla was very friendly and easy going and I felt really at home in her place.
1124388,7643503,2013-09-28T00:00:00.000Z,"It was just an one day stay at Carl's place but we really enjoyed it. Carl was so thoughtful to prepare fruits, bread and milk, and eggs for us for next day breakfast.  Thank you very much, Carl, for your kindness and wish you all the best!

Pawel and Anne"
647314,128029506,2017-01-22T00:00:00.000Z,"My girlfriend and I love Mallika's place. The photos and description on the advertisement are accurate. The flat is clean and well-maintained. The location is near the metro and convenience stores (in case you get hungry at night). Mallika herself was very accommodating and welcoming. She is a lovely person. And last but not least, Mallika's cats are fun to lounge with. :)"
581243,213620099,2017-11-22T00:00:00.000Z,Edwin is a great host and his apartment is impeccable. In addition it has an excellent shopping center and supermarket right next door. I had a great time and I will be back whenever possible!
299154,74934855,2016-05-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Leiligheten var sentralt plassert på Søder, og var liten, lett, overmøblert, ren og perfekt et kort opphold. Daniel var en glimrende og grei vert."
283446,201305217,2017-10-08T00:00:00.000Z,"It was very clean! The family was extremely welcoming and helpful! They gave great recommendations and made great meals for me! I absolutely loved the area, the bed, and the family. They are full of love and it was wonderful to be around! Couldn’t give enough praise."
1182616,523224729,2019-09-03T00:00:00.000Z,"The flat is nice and minimalistic. It's located near the metro station, stores, and restaurants. It's about 30 minutes walking to the historic city center — Gamla Stan.

Please, keep in mind that you're going to live with travelers from 2 additional rooms. This means a queue to take a shower or make breakfast or dinner. We used to wait for about an hour while other people were taking a shower. However, you have complete privacy in your room.

The balcony is cozy, but not very suited for breakfasts — it's just a bonus.

A huge plus is that you can check-in and check-out on your own."
763407,195136625,2017-09-18T00:00:00.000Z,"We could not have picked a better place for stay in Stockholm. It was the perfect size for my two kids and my husband and I. The location is perfectly central to everything but on a nice quiet street. There are restaurants and stores and parks very close by and it was very easy to walk out the door and just go. Gabriella's communication, tips and recommendations were spot on and thus, a perfect host when coming to a new city. We would happily stay here again the next time we come into town and highly suggest it to others for a wonderful stay."
757320,218344855,2017-12-12T00:00:00.000Z,"L'appartement est très bien situé, proche de commerces, restaurants et à côté d'une station de métro. La chambre était propre et accueillante.

723539,29412008,2015-04-07T00:00:00.000Z,Very nice and clean apt in a super central location. Saluhallen and Sture Gallerian right around the corner and only a 5 min walk to the waterfront. Communication and organization worked perfectly. Thank you Mathias for the good accomodation.
763407,6707789,2013-08-22T00:00:00.000Z,"My partner and I had a great stay! The apartment was perfect, very clean, fresh, well equiped and ideal location. Gabriella was the perfect host, always keeping in touch with us prior to checking in and gave us some fantastic local recommendations... highly recommended :-) !!!"
