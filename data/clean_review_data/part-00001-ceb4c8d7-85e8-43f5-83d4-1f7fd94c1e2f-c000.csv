The Hostess Gabriella is a very nice Person. Uncomplicated and very helpful!

We will definitely come back =)"
1182616,78623636,2016-06-07T00:00:00.000Z,"The location is good and the room is like it's written in the description, it's big and comfortable but it's not clean. Dust was everywhere on the furnitures and on the floor. We had to clean it ourselves to put our stuff. The bathroom is awful, smelly, not clean and what is worse is shared with all the people in the house, which can be 7 or 8 (it depends) and this is NOT clear in the description. We never met Peter but the communication with him was prompt. He rents the whole house to AirBnB guests, means 3 rooms totally 7 or 8 people and this is not in the spirit of Airbnb. Usually we go thru Airbnb to meet the owner of the house, talk to him, enjoy some common experiences and especially get infos about the city where we travel. This is not the case at Peter's place. The kitchen is big and you can have a nice breakfast there, but again it is not clean. Everything is left to the guests, so if you are lucky to find other guests who are clean, then it's ok, otherwise pity for you.... I think the owner, even if he doesn't live in the house, has to come and clean (at least the bathroom) and check if everything is fine, otherwise it looks like you are in an hostel. The smelly bathroom has a shower which is at the same level of the floor, so water is everywhere when you take a shower and you need to dry the pavement by yourself. This is my first bad experience at Airbnb after so many years! I don't recommend this appartment."
763407,8374503,2013-10-28T00:00:00.000Z,"I stayed this apartment two days with two friends. It is the very stylish, clean, and comfortable apartment.

Gabriella is so kind that she helped me a lot  before I stayed here and gave me much information about sightseeing and restaurants around there. I and my friends had great time here.

I highly recommend the apartment and Gabriella as host."

819676,232216927,2018-02-04T00:00:00.000Z,This was such a great we! The host was wonderful and We really appreciated the accommodation for a late check in / letting us store our bags on the day we checked out. This room is perfect for exploring Stockholm - located in such a great part of the city (which is very walkable).
916806,74923848,2016-05-17T00:00:00.000Z,We absolutely loved it here! It was clean and in such a beautiful area. It's close to the lake and the town square. Thank you!
368952,1422485,2012-06-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Great host!  I had a tremendous time here.  \"Modern villa\" is an understatement.  You feel like your in the Royal palace with all of the adornments.  The place is very clean in a comfortable setting (especially the bed).  The place is better than the pictures provided. Mrs Bohman was very kind and helpful.  It was very easy to feel at home here.
    You are about 300 meter from the bus stop which takes 26 minute (according to the schedule) to get to the southern most main station of Stockholm. The neighborhood is a modern upscale residential suburb.  There is a separate cottage in the rear of the house that has one small room with a very comfortable bed.  This place comes highly recommended!"

164448,359558503,2018-12-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Li is indeed a super friendly host and her flat is a nice, cozy place where one feels welcome and like at home. It is clean, comfortable and quiet. It is also well connected to the public transport. A warm recommendation."
541875,298291138,2018-07-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Great location, small place but with everything you need. Martin was away but very easy to communicate with. Great apartment."
1149820,36781771,2015-07-01T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a great time at Klara's- the place is as beautiful as the pictures in the listing. We often had coffee at the Rio Pio theater, and enjoyed the market by the water on Sunday morning. We walked home every day from other parts of the city along the top of Sodermalm, watching the sun get closer to the horizon along montelius vagnus, then making our way to a view point with bald boulders, just over an old factory tower. One other bit of advice: if you see large groups drinking by the water, you should join them! Our favorite days ended at bars and beer gardens along the canal."
510398,525919717,2019-09-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Je recommande cet hébergement. Il est bien situé, au pied du tram. La chambre est confortable, il y a un grand lit, un dressing, une terrasse et une salle d'eau privée. De plus, Ric est un hôte sympathique, cultivé et accueillant."
283446,80881235,2016-06-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Vidhatri and her husband are very good hosts. They are nice and friendly people who believe in making people comfortable to the most.  The description was absolutely correct and the food she offered was really tasty. if you are looking for a small, comfortable, homely place with home made delicious food , this will be a wonderful experience in stockholm! We loved it.:)"
1041103,6955516,2013-09-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Alles in allem: zusammen mit unseren Freunden aus Italien hatten wir einen tollen Aufenthalt in einer tollen Unterkunft.
Karoline war sehr freundlich, hilfsbereit und zuverlässig. Ich konnte sie jederzeit kontaktieren und bekam schnell eine Antwort.
Die Lage der Wohnung ist optimal. Sehr nah an der U-Bahn Station. Gleich daneben hat es einen Supermarkt, der bis 23h geöffnet hat. Man ist mit der Tunnelbanan sofort im Zentrum, von wo aus mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln alles leicht erreichbar ist. Die Wegbeschreibung zur Wohnung ist sehr gut, wir haben es sofort gefunden. Die Schlüsselübergabe hat super geklappt. Vor der Abreise durften wir sogar unser Gepäck dort deponieren.
Die Wohnung sieht so freundlich aus wie auf den Bildern. Hübsch und einladend eingerichtet. Wir haben uns dort zu Hause gefühlt. Sauber, grosszügig, mit drei abschliessbaren Zimmern mit grossen Betten. In einem Zimmer hat es ein riesiges Bett, in dem 3 Personen schlafen könnten. Ein zusätzliches Bett steht im Wohnzimmer. Das Bad ist etwas klein, aber ok. Es hatte immer warmes Wasser. Die Küche hat alles, was man braucht, auch Gewürze. Und eine „Moca“ (ital. Kaffeemaschine), die super Kaffee macht. Karoline hat uns sogar erlaubt, ihren PC zu benützen. Sie sagte zwar, er sei sehr langsam. Wir fanden ihn nicht langsam. Jedenfalls waren wir sehr froh darüber. Unsere Tagesrouten hatten wir auf einen Stick gespeichert und so mussten wir nicht alle Unterlagen mitschleppen. Jeden Tag haben wir nach dem Wetter geschaut. Und auf „ (Hidden by Airbnb) map“, um rauszufinden, wo genau die einzelnen Strassen sind. 
All in all, together with our friends from Italy, we had a great stay in a great accomodation.
Karoline was very friendly, helpful and reliable. I could contact her at any time and quickly got a response.
The location of the apartment is ideal. Very close to the metro station. Right next to it there is a supermarket, which is open until 23h. With the Tunnelbanan you are immediately in the center, from where everything is easily accessible by public transport. The indication of direction to the apartment is very good, we found it immediately. The key handover worked great. Before leaving Karoline allowed us to deposit our luggage there.
The apartment looks so friedly like the pictures. Pretty and inviting. We felt at home there. Clean, spacious, with three lockable rooms with great beds. One room has a huge bed where 3 people could sleep. An extra bed is in the living room. The bathroom is a bit small, but ok. There was always hot water. The kitchen has everything you need, even spices. And a \"Moca\" (Italian coffee maker), which makes great coffee. Karoline has even allowed us to use her PC. Although she said it is very slow. We didn’t find. Anyway, we were very pleased. We checked our daily routes we had stored on a flash drive, so we did not have to lug all the documents. Every day we looked at the weather. And \" (Hidden by Airbnb) map\", to find out exactly where the roads are to individual."
763407,7034265,2013-09-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Gabriella is a caring, interested and reliable host. She was always there when we had a question and provided us with special information for Stockholm. 
The apartment is besides the great design in avert good shape and extremely clean. 
The location is great, you can walk to the metro and there are nice shops and restaurants in the street.
We had a good time!!"
608672,145387924,2017-04-18T00:00:00.000Z,Karl's place was exactly as advertised. He was very easy to communicate with and gave me detailed instructions on how to get to his flat from the airport. Very clean and cozy place. Very close to the main pedestrian street but just separated enough for quiet at night. I would definitely stay again.
954832,91056037,2016-08-03T00:00:00.000Z,"We had an amazing time at Mikael's apartment, probably the best with air bnb!! The apartment is so beautiful: clean, bright and it has everything you need from the shampoo to the coffee machine!! Also it's in a very good location: central but very quiet at night! The metro station is less than 5 minutes walking, so brilliant! And last but not least Mikael was incredibly kind, responsive, reliable, very helpful, he waited for us even though we took a late flight and showed his flat and gave us lots of tips and information about Stockholm!! He also was very flexible about our leaving time since we had a late flight, he kindly let us leave our suitcases in his home so we could go to visit Stockholm even on our last day and then take them back when we wanted!!
So he made our stay the best trip ever! We will certainly come back to Stockholm and with no doubts we are going to stay in this wonderful flat!!"
581243,246281869,2018-03-25T00:00:00.000Z,"I and my friend really enjoyed our short stay at Edwin's room in Stockholm. He was kind and nice, especially about the booking, he responded to me very  quickly. Room is clean and he kindly offered enough amenities."
313195,2605837,2012-10-14T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a very comfortable stay at David's place! The rooms and beds were comfortable and warm. The shower worked great as well, and the minimalistic furnishings were all we needed - as we were out and about most of the time anyway! The kitchen is nicely set-up in case you need to cook or store your food, etc, we only needed to boil some water for tea so it was perfect for us! Though there is a supermarket just around the corner and metro station just about 5-10 minutes walk. The neighbours had drilling in their apartment for 2 of the 4 days we were there - so it was an early morning call for us on those days! But that is not within anyone's control, and we still had a thoroughly happy stay. :) Thanks David!"
620848,13809626,2014-06-05T00:00:00.000Z,"This apartment was ideally located for us as I had a conference at the Stockholmsmässan, just the other side of the train station. It also would have normally been ideal for my wife and toddler to pop into town each day on the excellent train service, however the train lines were being maintained while we were there.
Hanna helpfully contacted me days before we arrived alerting us to this and giving alternative ways to get to the apartment and from there to the city via bus/metro. She even came out to the flygbussarna station in Liljeholmen to help us make our way by metro and bus from there and was extremely friendly and helpful.
I would think that when the trains are running as normal this would also be an ideal base for those exploring the city as it is only a very short train ride to the city centre, although Älvsjö itself is rather uninspiring.
The apartment was well equipped, spacious and there were several places to buy groceries and takeaways nearby, which was perfect for us with a small person.
Hanna was also happy to meet us much earlier than the listed check-in time, as we travelled all the way from Wellington and this was greatly appreciated.
Also appreciated and unexpected was that Hanna provided some basic groceries for us on arrival, making this more like a self-service B&B experience. 
The only small complaint was that we found the apartment needed a vacuum and my wife did this on arrival. However, in fairness, I think this was largely because we arrived early and despite going for a walk after dropping our bags off, may have rushed Hanna in her clean-up. Also, the previous tenant stayed 2 months, and I would have thought someone staying this long would have done some basic cleaning themselves. So we were not unhappy with this overall, and pleased we could check in on arrival in Sweden.
I would recommend future guests consider taking a bus from Arlanda airport to nearby Märsta station and the commuter train from here directly to Älvsjö if they want avoid the expensive Arlanda Express train service. We did this in reverse on the way to the airport when the trains were running again and it was less than half the price.
Many thanks, a very pleasant Swedish experience."
533880,8049868,2013-10-14T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a very good stay and experience with Jari.  The room was good, the bed was just barely wide enough for two but we managed.  Jari was very helpful and friendly.  It is a short walk to the subway for a short, two stop ride to the city center.  
We were able to walk from the Tallink ferry terminal, but the trip from the train station is longer and would need the subway.
We had a very good experience her and recommend this place."
451155,71455304,2016-04-25T00:00:00.000Z,I really enjoyed to be at Malins beatiful house at Stockholm. There was no problems. I saw wild deers on the yard. Wildlife in the middle of city!
1124388,101092115,2016-09-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Wir waren zu zweit für ein Wochenende in Stockholm und Carls Wohnung war als Unterkunft ideal. Einfach zu erreichen und gut an die Innenstadt angeschlossen. Da wir tolles Wetter hatten, sind wir meist zu Fuß bis in die Stadt gelaufen - immer am Wasser entlang, einfach toll.
Vor unserer Ankunft hat Carl uns mit allen notwendigen Infos versorgt, damit wir problemlos zu ihm finden. Das war super und hat sehr gut funktioniert.
Die Wohnung selbst ist klein, aber gemütlich. Alles, was wir brauchten haben wir gefunden und würden sofort wieder dort übernachten."
608672,358139934,2018-12-13T00:00:00.000Z,"So many good things about the stay at Karl’s place! Quiet street, beautiful building, comfortable space (for one at least), Karl was responsive to email. Shower situation is a little awkward. Otherwise really enjoyed my visit."
1251466,7843830,2013-10-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Dean and his wife were very helpful and friendly. the room is nice and clean and has a large soft bed and it makes you wish sleep in in the morning:)thank you, Dean!"
954832,343973187,2018-11-02T00:00:00.000Z,Thank you SO SO SO very much for an outstanding stay. Our trip to Stockholm was exponentially better with Mikael’s help and guidance. The apartment was so clean and the bed was so comfortable after a long day of sight-seeing and “meeting” the city. Thank you again for everything- you are the best!
1212891,33454614,2015-05-28T00:00:00.000Z,Maud var en perfekt värd. Personlig och vänlig. Vi kände oss mycket välkomna i hennes hem. Återkommer gärna.
757320,110779211,2016-10-28T00:00:00.000Z,A very comfortable place with a big bathroom and well located near the old town and subway station. Barb is a nice host..
581243,362434054,2018-12-26T00:00:00.000Z,very clean
915013,469205039,2019-06-14T00:00:00.000Z,Alexander’s place is close to the city center in a more residential area. I stayed here for three nights when in town for work. Alexander was friendly and the place was nice and convenient.
1182616,90636490,2016-08-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Peter is very kind and informed us very well to get from the airport to the city etc..... but unfortunately we never meet him..
We spent a Weekend in Stockholm for 3 nights and we were 3 persons. 

Appartment/Location:
It was a very lovley appartment in a good Location in the City. You can get to everything easily. The room in the appartment had enough space for three persons. There are two other rooms in the appartment where other persons are renting, so it could be that you will meet other travelers =)
When you are a relaxed person and don't expect a high class Hotel with a bathroom for every single person this is a nice opportunity for visiting Stockholm.

It was very nice for our weekend in this area!"
533880,22630111,2014-11-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Jarl is a very friendly host. He is really knowledgable and always available when I have questions. His room is nice and cozy. The place is located in a convenient position. It takes a 5-minute walk to the metro station and bus stations which are connected to most of the places in Stockholm. There are good restaurants around too. To sum up, it was a great experience staying in Jarl's place and I would highly recommend his place to everyone."
954832,24070279,2014-12-19T00:00:00.000Z,"I lived almost 3 months in Mikael' s appartment during the first period of my Sabbatical. Chosing this appartment was an excellent decision. Mikael is a very friendly, helpful and caring host and neighbour. The communication was very good, he had worthful advice and answered questions always promptly e.g.via sms. The appartment is clean,cosy and equipped with a lot of useful things. It has easy access to puplic transportation and shops. I have already recommended it to friends! Tack så mycket!"
581243,127985044,2017-01-22T00:00:00.000Z,Edwin is as welcoming and charming as discret. So we had everything we need but totaly independant.nice balance. Thank you to Edwin who contribute to our really Nice Journey in Stockholm !

L'appartement de Nettan est bien situé, proche du métro et du centre-ville. Il est aussi très confortable et bien équipé.
Je n'ai pas vraiment eu le temps de parler avec Nettan, étant à l'extérieure la plupart du temps mais elle est très sympathique, arrangeante et le résultat est qu'on se sent très à l'aise chez elle. Je recommande :)

Nettan's appartment has a good location, close to subway and city centre. It's very confortable and it has everything you may need.
I didn't have time to really have some talk with Nettan (I was outside most of the time) but I can say that she is a kind and easy-going host. She made me feel at home. I truly recommend her :)"
776155,3620242,2013-02-26T00:00:00.000Z,"We had the pleasure to stay at Ann-Sofie's beautiful apartment for a weekend in February. Ann-Sofie was a great host, very friendly and helpful. The apartment is just as nice as in the pictures, stylish, comfortable and well equipped. The bed was a dream! We really enjoyed the location, very central and close to the subway, nice restaurants and cafés, yet quiet and relaxed. 

We can highly recommend this place, we had a great time and would love to come back someday."

Nice and clean appartment, well equipped with even an Italian Mocca, Karin left all necessary information about keys, WIFI ecc. The only thing we struggeld with was the stove as we use gas and not electric ones, but we made it eventually. There are two grocery stores close by and also bars and restaurants, We really enjoyed and felt like real Stockholmers."
763407,54765035,2015-11-23T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment was lovely, cosy, tastefully done and really kept nicely.
Around 10-15 mins walk to the city centre and buses outside so it was very convenient. Gabriella was out of town so coudlnt meet her but she had really made sure everything was taken care of to the small details. Even some nice breakfast in the fridge. Overall great stay."
1124388,148530664,2017-05-01T00:00:00.000Z,Great place - ~20 mins by bus to the city centre. Quiet area with a couple of nice restaurants/bakeries on the island itself. Comfortable.

776155,4645007,2013-05-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Ann-Sofie's apartment was wonderfully situated in a fantastic walking neighborhood very near to the metro, so we could easily get everywhere we wanted.  It is a very safe and nice neighborhood.  The apartment itself was just beautiful, like a rustic and open penthouse, on the top floor of the building. It was spacious with a really nice outdoor space to enjoy the cool air and just sit and relax.  Ann-Sophie was so lovely and very easy to communicate with both via e-mail prior to our arrival and during via text. The only bummer is that we didn't cross paths at all!  I would rent this apartment again in a heartbeat and recommend it to anyone looking for an airy space to relax, cook themselves a meal and enjoy Stockholm.  Perfection!"

We didn't get to meet Klara, but she was very helpful. Maybe some more instructions in the usage of the apartment might be useful, for example where we can bring away the trash... ;)"

301680,32076300,2015-05-13T00:00:00.000Z,"I loved staying at Anitta's home! It is clean, cosy and comfortable with everything you need. Anitta is very welcoming and helpful and happy to answer any questions you may have, you will be well looked after. I have moved to Sweden temporarily and Anitta was an amazing help with many other things such as more permanent accommodation after my stay, which made my transition incredibly smooth. It is such a short walk around the corner to the 144 bus stop, and only a 10 minute bus ride to Fruangen T-bana. Långbro is gorgeous, with a lake and a forest nearby, and it's a great idea to stay here if you want to experience a quieter and typically Swedish area, it's very pretty. You will feel like a local and I would highly recommend staying here to anyone, thank you very much Anitta!"

Scott was very nice host, he provided us with a very comfortable stay at his apartment with access to parking etc.

Nous avons particulièrement apprécié l'accueil et la disponibilité de Mikaël, qui a largement contribué à la réussite de notre séjour.
Dès la réservation, nous avons reçu un descriptif sur l'appartement et le quartier. Lors de notre arrivée, Mikaël nous attendait pour nous présenter l'appartement et pour répondre à toutes nos questions. 
Pendant le séjour, il restait toujours disponible (mail, sms).
Je recommande vivement!!"

Остались очень довольны гостеприимством хозяина, он все доступно и четко объясняет, и посещением красивого города!"

536691,11538829,2014-04-07T00:00:00.000Z,Lovely flat...lots of personality. Sødermalm rules :-) Greetings from Magnus and Torsten in Copenhagen :-)

P.s. the cats were amazing"
1182616,14980083,2014-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,"It was great staying at Peter’s apartment. Clean bathroom, fully equipped kitchen with huge fridges, bedroom with balcony and large comfy double bed (perhaps too soft for Spartan as I am). Well-located - close to the city center (about 20 minutes by walk). We really enjoyed our stay here. Would definitely highly recommend Peter’s place. Unfortunately we didn't met Peter, hope we can meet next time."
206221,242570342,2018-03-12T00:00:00.000Z,"We got a very nice, clean room in an accomodation with typical Swedish flair. Elisabeth is a very gentle, hearty, communicative person and so we nearly felt being at home. We unreservedly recommend staying there during your Stockholm trip!"

954832,44275165,2015-08-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Wir haben Airbnb zum ersten Mal genutzt und sind begeistert. Mikael hat schon im Vorfeld sehr freundlich geschrieben und uns mit allen nötigen Informationen versorgt, so dass wir uns sehr willkommen gefühlt haben. Dieser Eindruck hat sich auch während unseres Urlaubes bestätigt,
die Wohnung war sehr sauber und gemütlich und nur drei U-Bahnhaltestellen vom Zentrum entfernt, trotzdem weit genug, dass man auch mal dem grössten Trubel entfliehen konnte. Gute Einkaufsmöglichkeiten und eine sehr gute Pizzeria gleich um die Ecke.
Ein rundum gelungener Urlaub, vielen Dank nochmal an Mikael, wir können die Unterkunft nur weiterempfehlen."
1096827,83963027,2016-07-04T00:00:00.000Z,"The flat is amazing. Cozy, quiet, feeling like home. We appreciate the help from Anita! She left some breakfast for us, and even though we arrived late, she still waited until we got there and gave us some travel advices. Anita is a very lovely and friendly host! The apartment is close to the metro and easy to find. We enjoy our stay very much! Definitely recommend it!"
581243,493870727,2019-07-23T00:00:00.000Z,Edwin is a kind and helpful host. I was allowed to drop my luggage early in the morning just after reaching Stockholm. Edwin was very helpful in planning my further journey. I can definitely recommend him as a host.
1244657,152970231,2017-05-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Warm and friendly hosts, A+ location near the trains, buses, and ferry to Skeppsholmen. Many cafes, bars, and restaurants in the neighborhood. The room is basic but it is larger than it looks in the pictures... a pleasant surprise! I would stay with Nic and Usha again."
541875,6822591,2013-08-26T00:00:00.000Z,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at Martin's lovely studio. The apartment is very well appointed; Martin set out bathrobes for us, a fruit basket, and had many interesting books, records, and movies to entertain. The apartment itself was impeccably clean, with a very comfortable bed.

The apartment itself is well located, close to many lovely parks, and is within walking distance to the old city and all the attractions. 

Martin was also incredibly friendly and kind. Our flight did not get in until very late at night and Martin waited for us until well after midnight. Martin was easily reachable, gave excellent directions to and from the apartment, and was very kind and communicative - a wonderful host.

This is a great option for staying in a very expensive city. We loved our stay here, and would highly recommend it."
1304431,15313472,2014-07-07T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a lovely time in Madeleine's apartment. Great setup for our Aussie family of 4, with everything we needed, including a garden with swing, which got the big thumbs up from our daughter! Really enjoyed the neighborhood, lovely tapas restaurant at end of road and we felt like locals at the Italian around the corner. Close to transport and a great place to stay. Cheers, Hilary"
974175,160430934,2017-06-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Jesper & Sophie were so kind and informative. Their apartment is beautiful and modern. It's very spacious and we felt very comfortable. It's a couple blocks from public transportation and walking distance to restaurants, bars, shops & all parts of Stockholm. Would definitely recommend staying here."
475409,9840950,2014-01-13T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a lovely stay at Corettas apartment in Stockholm. The apartment was clean and had everything we needed. Coretta was a fantastic host very helpful and supplied maps and top tips on areas to visit. This was very helpful as we were only there for a flying visit. I would highly recommend."
900043,114021027,2016-11-15T00:00:00.000Z,Everything great! Enjoyed it immensely!
536283,5597068,2013-07-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Great apartment in a lovely part of Stockholm with plenty to do in the neighborhood. The apartment was clean comfortable. Very close to transit and the city center as well. 

We slept very well and it was the perfect little home base for our stay in Stockholm! We even had a chance to do some laundry in the building which was a great plus."
1124388,110227060,2016-10-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Carl was a great host. Everything was as shown in pictures and he was very easy to contact. He gave us a lot of advice on commuting to the place before hand and was very willing to help when we had question. He also offered multiple guide packets to Stockholm. Overall we had a great stay.  His place was clean and had everything we needed, transportation was very convenient as well."
608672,135072672,2017-03-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Karl was fantastic! Extremely helpful-- a perfect host. 

The space was smaller than I thought. But that doesn't matter when you're out all day anyway. 

The shower is the only issue I had. It's not a \"real\" shower, but a hose connected to the wall in the bathroom. There was a metal barrier provided that would contain the water. But it didn't work well so most days our bathroom flooded and we'd have to squeegee it out. 

*Also, the bathroom smelled heavily of smoke. Just the bathroom, though."
299154,32360980,2015-05-17T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment is really well arranged and spacious even for 4 grown ups. It has all the things you would need including a cozy balcony perfect for chilling late in the evening after a busy day.

The location is perfect for walking around the most hip parts of town. It was actually the main reason for choosing it over everything else as, not only you save up money from the public transportation, but also are close to lots of pubs, cafes and restaurants.

As for the host, Daniel was very friendly and flexible with the checkin/out times. Getting the keys and leaving the apartment was smooth. My friends and I had a great time here."
259722,105051552,2016-09-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Jeg følte meg veldig velkommen hos Marcelo. Han er blid og imøtekommende, og fikk meg til å føle meg som hjemme :) 

Jeg hadde fri disposisjon til rom, stue og bad, og leiligheten lå veldig sentralt til 

anbefales absolutt videre :)"
283446,2523715,2012-10-06T00:00:00.000Z,"It was a very pleasant and home-like stay with Vidhatri and family. From the first day itself, they treated me like house member. The room was tidy and good sized, with internet access, and even DVDs were offered with some interesting short films. :)  They also served fantastic dinner and we had quiet interesting conversations over the table with their family. Home cooked breakfast was a perfect start for day as well in Stockholm. Overall a very pleasant stay and highly recommended."
1234960,21100545,2014-10-11T00:00:00.000Z,Bra för flera. Trevlig och schysst värd. Lungt område. 5 min till globen.
1261445,148876958,2017-05-01T00:00:00.000Z,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
164448,160883999,2017-06-16T00:00:00.000Z,Linda was warm and courteous  while having us in her cute bnb. She was always quick to respond to our queries.
347192,24195208,2014-12-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Well-located out of the \"tourist hub\" of Stockholm. Clean towels and clean linen on arrival although apartment and bathroom could do with a clean. A comfy living area to \"feel at home\" and enjoy a cooked meal with friends. Better for families with small children than four adults as second room is small. No cupboard space to unpack. Mathilda was efficient and available for any questions."
242188,100414817,2016-09-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Ottima accoglienza. Lidia mi ha fornito tutte le informazioni necessarie, mezzi pubblici, musei etc.  Appartamento carino e comodo. Tutto ben organizzato. Un po' piccola la mia stanza, ma letto comodissimo. C'è tutto il necessario per farsi un caffé o un té, e anche un forno a microonde a disposizione degli ospiti."
357012,296541780,2018-07-26T00:00:00.000Z,Calle’s light and stylish apartment is in a great location on Södermalm - within easy reach of the centre but also close to the Mälarstrand waterfront and the wooded Island of Långholmen (good swimming). We did not meet Calle and family but communications were excellent. I can highly recommend Calle’s place. We hope we can return.
819676,110888107,2016-10-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Andy and Vannie's place is very nice. Conveniently located in a cool neighborhood and a few mins walking from the Old town. The hosts were friendly and helpful arranging check in and check out. Perfect for one person, room is maybe a little bit small for couples but still ok for short stays."
1182616,473861318,2019-06-22T00:00:00.000Z,Die Unterkunft ist toll gelegen. Zentral und alles fußläufig zu erreichen. Mehrere Einkaufsläden im Umkreis der Wohnung kann man für den Einkauf auswählen. Es können drei Zimmer gemietet werden. Bad und Küche wird mit den anderen Bewohnern geteilt. Die Sauberkeit und Betten waren in Ordnung. Peter hat zügig auf Fragen geantwortet. Wir hatten einen tollen Aufenthalt in Stockholm.
1182616,10177271,2014-02-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Great location, and Peter is a very welcoming and communicative host."

259025,2615213,2012-10-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Me and my girlfriend had a nice 9 day stay in Ali´s house. The house is situated near to the subway and there are some supermarkets nearby. Ali is very helpfull and hospitable to his guests.

Best regards from Germany"
608672,34744387,2015-06-11T00:00:00.000Z,"I enjoyed my stay in Karl's apartment very much. Karl is a very personable host. He gave me great tips on what to do / see in Stockholm. The apartment is located in a very nice neighborhood, <15 min walk from the main train station and the old city center. It is tiny but cosy and tidy. You will find there everything you need for a short stay in Stockholm."
1212891,300078061,2018-08-01T00:00:00.000Z,Maud was really nice and relaxed We felt immediately welcome and enjoyed our stay at her cozy place.  Especially the big kitchen is nice for cooking and sitting.
242188,1423161,2012-06-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia was an exceptional host and my stay was made extremely comfortable. Lidia was very accommodating even though I arrived late, and she even fed me a snack because all the stores were closed! The location of the apartment is superb, and I could not have asked for a better experience with this host. Conversations amongst tea and coffee were always pleasant! Thank you Lidia!"
748847,31221641,2015-05-03T00:00:00.000Z,"I didn't have the chance to meet Heath since he had to catch a train before I arrived, but the communication was excellent, the apartment is really in a great location, the interior courtyard is cozy, and the apartment is just as described. There's nothing like stepping out of the shower unto a heated bathroom floor. He even kindly left my friends and me a bottle of wine. I would certainly recommend this place. Thanks, Heath!"
916806,101189241,2016-09-12T00:00:00.000Z,"First things first: everything was at its place and absolutely clean and also new. Checkin without problems. Communication was quick and very customer centric. Location is a good bargain for a two adults \"city hopper\" setting.

Unfortunately we arrived with 2 adults and 2 little children. Therefor it wasn't the right fit. I recommend to:

1) not rent appartment for more than two people or 2 adults & 1 child. Especially if you plan to stay longer than 3-4 nights. Room is not 50sqm, 1-room-appartment, Windows only at the frontside, very small bathroom without window,...

2) not stick 100% to text and images of description. Appartment is rather a refurbished souterrain/cellar than first floor. Hence a drain pump is needed for each wastewater transportation, which ends up in loud noises while working. Additionally you will hear each and every activity of people living in the appartment above. Both is particularly disturbing at night and in the evening hours while kids are trying to sleep. Pictures and description where made from a strong marketing perspective.

3) not expect too much from surrounding. It is okay, but less \"fantastic\" and \"unique\" as written within description. Please find more about Skarholmen itself at Wikipedia, aso.! Beside the calm and child friendly small chain house area you will find a lot of concrete, e.g. if walking to train station. 

4) make sure you are willing to travel a bit into the city center as appartment is some kilometers in the suburbs (as described by the owners)."
274876,312240065,2018-08-23T00:00:00.000Z,"A lovely appartment in a quiet neigbourhood with very handy shops and restaurants in the vicinity. Ideally located and with excellent transport links to the city, with bus stops almost at the building door. Highly recommended for a little family."
299154,25693798,2015-01-23T00:00:00.000Z,"This was a most amazing hospitality I saw, actually never seeing the host. We kept meeting little notes here and there, which explained everything we needed to know about the apartment, Stockholm, Sweden and the whole world. Well, kidding about the last one, but, really, the lore was comprehending, we will now check out the bookstores for his Stockholm Guide, so much worthy his guidelines about life in Södermalm's region are. I skip the delicate part of how flexible he is as a host about various aspects any traveler might want to flex. And being most generous towards our egotistic manners was just one more precious quality of him, amidst whole a lot. Besides, we learned a couple tricks, which let us enter civilized society from now on,  so no more leaving the key under the floor mat, after all. Stockholm in Daniel's edition is great, what more can I say?"
916806,199115899,2017-10-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Amazing place with awesome panorama view, apartement was nice and clean. Everything was exactly as i desired."
1158893,64772757,2016-03-08T00:00:00.000Z,"this is a really home in my long vacatio. everything is good, more than image.
thank you, deany! I will back on summer .
超级可爱有品味的一栋房子,4间卧室,两个浴室和厕所,离车站有点远,走路15-20分钟,车站边有个不小的超市｡比起瑞典的高房价,这个价格对家庭旅行者来说不能更赞,从一开始房东就非常友好的推荐我当地的玩乐和美食｡
厨房里锅碗瓢盆调料咖啡茶包一应俱全,还有太太亲手准备的各种说明｡唯一的缺点大概是洗澡烧水一次最多两个人,人多了就要等等｡浴室甚至有桑拿房｡"
451155,19644528,2014-09-15T00:00:00.000Z,Malin is so nice!!!! I really love Malin's house. It's very spacious and clean. Thank you!! I will definitely recommend this house to everyone
647314,12487360,2014-05-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Mallika was a very nice host and we had a great stay in Stockholm! Thank you for having us, it was a pleasure meeting you!"
442837,4603246,2013-05-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Jo's apartment was very nice, clean, modern as you can see the pictures! Unfortunately, I was not able to meet Jo since she was in vacation but I was very glad to meet Jo's mom Lidia. She is such a lovely mom! She advised me where I should visit, also how to get the airport :)
The apartment is very nice and I love the terrace! Very convenient to the central station. If you are still looking for the place to stay, definitly recommend Joanna's apartment!
Thank you again to Jo and Lidia :)"
1182616,43279424,2015-08-18T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed one night and it was ok! The bed is extremely comfortable! Maybe for long term stay one toilet for 3 rooms could be a problem but except for that the house, the location and the host are perfect!"
145320,273792504,2018-06-07T00:00:00.000Z,"The main advantage of Kim's home is the excellent location. It's in hip and trendy Södermalm, but in a quiet street, so you'll get a good night's sleep. Also Petrus bakery, which makes the most delicious cinnamon buns, is right around the corner. Kim was - once she was home -  a very good host full of helpful tips and information. As it says elsewhere in the comments, the flat is lovingly decorated and exudes the air of a place well-loved and lived-in. However, if you want fancy and stylish accommodation this is not it. It's perfectly serviceable for a few days though and we'd still recommend it."
581243,18665676,2014-08-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Had a good stay with Edwin, excellent location, nice room."
763407,18810311,2014-09-01T00:00:00.000Z,Gabriella was a nice host. We arrived late but she was still waiting for us. She introduced shortly the sourrounding and left her number for us. We could asked her everything. So she was great. The apartment offers a lot space for everyone and is really nice located in the center. The equipment was good as well^^
819676,172123944,2017-07-20T00:00:00.000Z,"I enjoyed my stay at Andy and Vannie's clean, comfortable, modern apartment. It is close and convenient to public transportation but located on a quiet side street. The cheerful bedroom is light and plenty of fresh air is available through the window. Andy and Vannie made my stay easy and I would stay here again."
755843,131987679,2017-02-15T00:00:00.000Z,Très bel emplacement dans un quartier proche du centre et bien desservi par les transports publics. L'appartement situe dans un immeuble ancien est très cosy et on s'y sent très vite comme à la maison. Les commerces sont situés à proximité . Nous remercions notre hôte pour la gentillesse de son accueil. Nous recommandons vraiment cette adresse
1096827,469771833,2019-06-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Wunderschöne Altbau-Wohnung im skandinavischen Stil, die viel größer ist als es auf den Fotos wirkt. Es ist alles da, was man braucht, und trotz der Lage etwas außerhalb ist man durch die nahe U-Bahn superschnell im Zentrum. Anita und auch eine Nachbarin, die wir getroffen haben, sind sehr nett und hilfreich bei allen Fragen oder Problemen, die man als Stockholm-Besucher so hat. Wir wollen wieder kommen!"

Wir haben uns in dem Appartement sehr wohl gefühlt, es ist alles da was man braucht, es war sehr sauber und auch Kinderfreundlich eingerichtet. Unsere Tochter ( 2 Jahre ) hat sich ebenfalls sehr wohl gefühlt. 
Das Apartment ist, wie beschrieben, sehr schön und praktisch gelegen. Es ist sehr ruhig und nur ein paar Meter entfernt befindet sich ein schöner See und ein sehr nettes Café. Uns hat es sehr gut gefallen!"

Upon arrivals, Dany and Maria provides us plenty of helpful information about Stockholm and the area nearby. Communication was swift and they're always ready to help when we'd questions."

647314,83628298,2016-07-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Mallika's apartment is in a great location to walk or bike to almost any sight in Stockholm. Her neighborhood was peaceful and charming, but only a block away from great cafes, restaurants, and boutiques. Her apartment was clean, spacious, and inviting. Mallika was a very warm host, who gave us great tips and even helped us with booking a day trip to the islands. We also loved her cat, Ramses, who made the experience even more fun."

Neighbourhood is really nice too and Alex has a nice garden. Just to avoid confusion, maybe it should be added that when you leave the metro station, you go 600 m (3 blocks) to the RIGHT. Place is not hard to find, it takes you 25 minutes to Central station. If not there, Alex will be available to you via his phone number all the time."

299154,13645330,2014-06-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Daniel was a very generous host. He met us and gave us plenty of information about the apartment and the neighborhood. While it is a small flat, for the two of us it was perfectly serviceable and its location made it a great choice. 5 minutes walk to the old city, 10 minutes walk to the Sofo district of bistros, cafes and night life. Public transport was within easy reach.  We spent one day wlaking around the old town and the northern area and then back to \"home\" without getting tired. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom quite large and the balcony was an excellent place to cool off. Certainly would recommend it to a couple visiting Stockholm."

822497,477899256,2019-06-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Moa’s apartment was perfect for our needs.  It is located just a short walk from the subway which easily got us to the center of Stockholm as well as the Central Station for day trips out of town.  There is also a grocery store within walking distance of the apartment.  The kitchen was well stocked with anything we needed and Moa generously encouraged us to use the spices and seasonings.  We also found the main bedroom to be comfortable.  There were just 2 of us, so we can’t comment on the other beds.  However, there was a second smaller bedroom which would allow privacy for additional travelers, and additional sleeping options in the living room.  We’ve had the experience of renting apartments that are cluttered with personal items, bric a brac, toiletries, etc.  However, Moa’s apartment was free of clutter, tastefully decorated, and allowed us to feel like the place was truly our own for our 10 day stay. Overall, we would recommend this apartment and will likely look to rent it again in the future!"
164448,83652827,2016-07-03T00:00:00.000Z,Lidia was an absolutely amazing host. She greeted us warmly every time we entered the house! The bed was very comfortable and the room was a good size for my husband and I to share. The location was amazing and very walkable. If my husband and I go back to Stockholm we would stay here again.
1231897,511215090,2019-08-17T00:00:00.000Z,The place is near a metro station so it's very convenient to get to the old town and city center. The area feels safe. The apartment is clean and quiet. I slept very well. Alex is a nice and friendly guy. Highly recommended!

He even had a bottle of champagne for us in the fridge! You should know that this is not an anonymous vacation apartment, but his real home, so we were very grateful that he let us stay in it. The location is very convenient (close to restaurants, shops, buses, and the water) and we felt very safe and at home. We can highly recommend this apartment, and we will try to stay there again next time we are in Stockholm."

The bedroom is a decent size with a comfortable size, the bathroom though small has a wide range of toiletteries for the use of the guests.
  Although another long term guest was using the other bedroom, we were not really inconvenienced.
  Maud's accomodation is very handy to the metro line, and the supermarket is within walking distance. Maud gave us some good tips on sightseeing, which proved to be very useful."

220851,74377479,2016-05-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Fredric was a great host for my girlfriend and I, and has a lovely apartment in a great area just north of Kungsholmen in Stockholm. There are plenty of cafes and bars in the area, as well as shops for vintage items and home decor. Fredric was very non-intrusive and friendly, always accommodating us as best he could. While we didn't spend that much time together (we were only in Stockholm for the Eurovision Song Contest) Fredric gave us good tips on the area and communicated with us well both before and during our trip. The room is spacious, bright, and the bed is incredibly comfortable. The room perhaps becomes a little light in the morning as there are only blinds over the windows - that's our only real criticism. Otherwise, a great, calm stay in an apartment with a really minimalist, soothing atmosphere."

When I arrived, she served me tea and shared with me tips and advices on where to visit, provided me with brochures and maps to assist. 

The location and accommodation was same as described - Nice cozy room in a central location. The apartment is clean, and neighbourhood is safe enough to walk in the streets at night. 

I stayed at Lidia's place for 5 nights, and often we find ourselves engaging in hour long conversations around many topics, ranging from travel to politics. 

Thank you for the interesting conversations and hospitality during my stay."

It was a very friendly welcome and in the forefront I got all the information I needed to find the house. He also reserved the room for me, because I had problems with my credit card.
Everything is extremely clean and I enjoyed every minute in my room. The bed is really warm, comfortable and fluffy. There is a lot of free space in the room to stow all your clothes. The Wi-Fi is fast and you also have a TV with a couple of stations in Swedish and English. Also the fully equipped kitchen can be used.
Like all the other guests I would highly recommend this place! Everything five stars."

It is much larger than the pictures show, is extremely well equipped and in a lovely neighbourhood (for those that don't know Stockholm it is also only a 15 minute walk to the waterfront but located in a very traditional and smart neighbourhood). Seta and Goran are both delightful and very helpful and generous too. We could not have stayed in a  better place and could not recommend their flat more highly."

Having the bathroom opposite the bedroom was a plus and there was ample space to get ready. The location of the flat was perfect as it was close to the T-bana if we wanted to take public transit, but it was so close to great bars and restaurants, Gamla Stan, and even the city centre, that we often chose to walk everywhere. Would definitely stay again!"
608672,166940959,2017-07-05T00:00:00.000Z,Very simple and comfortable flat in a central area of Stockholm. Karl was a nice and helpful host. Has everything you need in a historical building and safe area!
385701,88226320,2016-07-23T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a wonderful stay in the stylishly decorated and quiet home of Alex. The house is located in a wonderful green park, with nice neighbours and an all-pedestrian path to the playground, the beach, the metro,… It sits about half an hour from the city centre (walking + metro) but offers a very green surrounding and we had a great time changing city time for trips in the area, f.i. going to farsta strand or hellasgarden.
The house is well equipped and Alex was a kind host, responding to all our questions promptly and although we did not meet in person, we experienced his helpfulness and quick help when we had a small problem with the codelock."

Besides, he described the directions to his apartment vividly, and thus I could find the location without any problems. Most important thing of all is the location is perfect, just across from the metro station.( It is hard for u to miss) I dropped my luggage early in the morning and he even let me leave my luggage in his apartment when I wen to another city, so I could travel light without dragging heavy bags, which really saved me lots of trouble.

The location is central, right near a metro stop, and it's about a 10 minute metro ride, or 15 to 20 minute walk from the central train station.  There are many cute restaurants and cafes right near the apartment.  And it's very easy to get to all the major Stockholm attractions.

Gustav is an excellent host.  He was in touch before our arrival and greeted us right when we got to the apartment.  He gave us great recommendations for places to visit and restaurants to try.  He also offered us the use of his and his girlfriend's bikes in case we wanted a quicker way to get around the city.  We ended up walking all over the place because we prefer to see the city that way, but it was very nice of Gustav to offer and good to know that the option was there.  Check in and check out were a breeze, and we enjoyed our stay there tremendously."

862868,17667804,2014-08-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Pernilla was an extraordinary host, both responsive and welcoming.

The apartment was spotless and fully-furnished, and was home to an impressive personal library (including a few on Stockholm). Great lighting throughout, and in the rear of the building lies a private, tree-lined courtyard. 

The building is surrounded by array of shops, restaurants and cafes—with an Espresso House around the corner, opening soon! The tunnelbana is directly across the street, and T-Centralen only a stop away.

This was my first experience with AirBnB, and couldn't have been happier. I'd recommend Pernilla's apartment without hesitation."

Bathroom was a great size (much improved over some of our other European apartments with tiny bathrooms) Electra met us to check in and was a great host and easily reachable via messaging.

The room is quiet & she keeps the apartment very clean; we didn't use the kitchen except to eat the (very tasty) breakfasts she prepared for us, so I'm not sure if cooking is OK, but I'm sure you could ask her.

One note - there are two single twin beds in the room against different walls, so if you're a couple you'll sleep separately. But everythings very comfortable."

Terry provided easy communication while we arranged our visit and on our arrival he had kindly made a delicious chicken soup for us. The apartment was exactly as described and the perfect size for 4 adults and a baby. Terry even had a pink cot for my daughter! We'd recommend this place to anyone wanting to explore Stockholm as you can explore most places on foot. We'd definitely use again if we returned!

The place is clean and tidy.

Only thing I can give a heads up on is the host lives next door and the apartment is basically attached to his. Seems like it was once all one apartment and was renovated. There's not much space but is generally good."

The flat is super central and we could reach everywhere walking. The flat is very nice and comfy. They gave us a few good recommendations as well. Definitely will come back!
819676,131435484,2017-02-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Andy and Vannie 's place is perfect, located very centre of city , 2 min from the station , you can go everywhere easily by metro ,buses,ferry or walk . Accurate descriptions and pictures. But most thing I love is Andy and Vannie themselves . I caught a cold and Vannie take good care on me , they are super warm person and I feel
Very Welcome. They invited me to dinner and taco night and we spend some nice time on musics , foods , movie and talks. I had a 8 night long stay comfortably. If you do like privacy it's perfect for you too, I stayed a lot of Airbnbs but first I ever see a inner lock inside the guest room. overall it's the best experience I ever had , recommended !"
283446,47166272,2015-09-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Direct connection to the center of Stockholm via metro/ tunnelbana, quiet neighborhood, large room with a comfy bed.
Many thanks to this wonderful family for treating me like a good old friend, for the delicious dinners, for all the suggestions regarding what to do in the city, for their warm and welcoming attitude during my short stay at their home. It really felt like HOME. This is really a place of light and kindness."
1124388,307437648,2018-08-14T00:00:00.000Z,"This apartment is perfectly located and had everything we needed when we arrived, and Carl was great - very communicative to make sure we found the apartment easily and accommodating even though we arrived earlier than expected! Highly recommended."

274876,1195155,2012-04-29T00:00:00.000Z,"I would definitely recommend staying in Emma’s apartment if you want to make the most of your stay in Stockholm. It’s extremely comfortable, bright and well-equipped. We loved the heated floor system in the bathroom and the Internet connection was lightning fast. Having an iPad at our disposal was a great plus to check the weather forecast every morning. 
The location is perfect too: within walking distance of Gamla Stan. If you prefer, bus n°2, which stops right next to the building, will take you to the city center in a matter of minutes. There are plenty of restaurants and bars in the neighbourhood and a rather large supermarket close by.
Emma was a lovely hostess and gave us many good tips. We felt very much at home in Stockholm."
1304431,286061014,2018-07-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Madeleine’s place is conveniently located to explore Stockholm. We had a rather late checkin due to SJ rail but Madeleine stayed in constant touch with us and guided us through a remote checkin. We were traveling with a 4 month old infant and when I requested a late check out (again due to SJ rail), she graciously obliged.
The apartment is centrally located and close to lot of trendy eating joints and has all the conveniences you would expect. A great  courtyard facing balcony for your morning coffee. 
We would recommend her place to our friends."
688947,87658536,2016-07-21T00:00:00.000Z,It was not so nice cuz we rent a home and accepted that the check in was already late and then he kept dilaing it then if the home is for sharing so it  must be changed on the site from( eget hus) own house cuz not everyone gonna have time to read all this introduction about it especially when it's so long and then 2 words about he is  gonna come shower and cook anytime or sleep in a tand in the yard

Un petit commerce est situé juste en face de la résidence pour les produits de première nécessité."
1212891,94033253,2016-08-14T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed at Mauds's cozy apartment on two separate occasions, and are so glad we got to book with her twice! She has such a warm and inviting personality and her home is the same. Everything is clearly labelled so your stay is easy. The room was perfect, very clean and cozy. The kitchen is lovely to eat in and watch the neighbourhood outside. We absolutely loved the neighbourhood where Maud lives. Short walk to the transit station and so many great restaurants by the water to check out. Maud was also extremely helpful in answering any questions we had. And of course, the cats were adorable and made the stay even better. We highly recommend Maud's place to stay in Stockholm and would definitely return in the future!"

Upon my arrival Li greeted me with a warm cup of tea and a map of Stockholm where she gave me an overview of places to visit and see. The room was just as advertised: clean, warm, spacious (I'm from NY, everything seems big) and a solid WiFi signal. I'd definitely stay with Li again if I travel to Stockholm."

She offered us tea and coffee after we entered, and proceeded to provide us lots of detailed information on both Stockholm and the local area. We had everything we needed for the stay (hair dryer, towels, etc.)

A few guests were staying in the other rooms but it didn't seem too busy in terms of sharing the washroom or common spaces. Overall the apartment is quite large as it spans two floors.

The neighbourhood is very convenient for exploring Södermalm and is close to the Södra station for easy metro access. (We recommend trying pastries from nearby Fabrique!)"
628555,129134426,2017-01-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice place to stay! We arrived late in Stockholm, Anna arranged a taxi for us, she also arranged something to eat and half a bottle of wine!"

The flat is positioned about 3 mins from the bus stop and a fantastic transport system that can take you anywhere round Stockholm. (we got the weeks travel card - and downloading the app is a must).
Lovely little island with fantastic views and amazing bakers (wonderful cardamon buns!!) and a small supermarket just across the road in case you need anything.
Already planning our return trip!!"
1182616,316978319,2018-09-01T00:00:00.000Z,The price is not worth the stay.
1261445,36533689,2015-06-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Man sieht, spürt, fühlt, dass Marie-Louise Wert auf die Liebe im Detail legt. Das ruhig gelegene Appartement (mit angenehmen und beruhigenden Ausblick) war ästhetisch eingerichtet; mit vielen spannenden Objekten. Wir teilen diese Vorliebe und haben uns deshalb außerordentlich wohl gefühlt.

Ansonsten teilen wir alle bisherigen Kommentare.
Danke!!!"
647314,196949285,2017-09-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Thank you Mallika :) 
We spent a nice stay at your home. This last one was tastefully decorated and very well situated (ver close to the centre- 15 minutes on foot) and in a very vibrant district (Sodermalm). What we really appreciate was the flexibility offered by Mallika when departing: our last day we were allowed to leave our luggages in the entrance and pick them up later, before taking our filght in the evening. Such a joy !  Thank you for that !! Great value comparing the others airbnb, I recommend it !! If I had to restrain a negative point: I would say that we just regret the lack of privacy (perhaps more suited to friends than for a couple). But more positives than negatives !"
904739,508148617,2019-08-12T00:00:00.000Z,Great little apartment! Menaf went to a lot of effort to make sure there was plenty in the fridge and the stay was super comfortable.

The host was willing to share her stories to us. She was happy in the morning, but sometimes sad at night. She better be more polite to the guests and not to shout at us."
647119,6386255,2013-08-11T00:00:00.000Z,We had a wonderful time in this fantastic flat. It is decorated with a lot of love and you are living in the center of södermalm. The comunication with Mallika was without any problem. The rooms are full of atmosphere. A nice place to stay.
299154,107567778,2016-10-11T00:00:00.000Z,"I spent two nights in Daniel's apartment. He is a really nice guy, being very cooperative and informant, and replies to your message promptly, and even prepared a detailed guidebook about the city, which is so helpful. The apartment is cozy, fully equipped, in a good location, close to metro, supermarket, restaurants. A wonderful experience!"
688947,18505486,2014-08-27T00:00:00.000Z,"My name is Tatiana and rested with my husband Artem in Stockholm at the end of August. We stayed in the apartment of Alexandre. His apartment is located in 20 minutes by subway from the city centre. Access is very easy. Alexandre friendly musician from Brazil. His apartment is very cozy and clean. Everywhere the spirit of South America, which makes its own intrigue. We were very comfortable and welcome."

It's a little on the small side, but was nevertheless perfect for two people. It's right in the heart of Stockholm, close to bars, restaurants, shopping, and the historic old town."
904739,26068283,2015-02-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Menaf's home was beautiful, well-kept, spacious, cozy, well-stocked, and very conveniently located. My travel partner and I were thrilled from the moment we walked in the door, and coming back home each day was a pleasure knowing we were returning to such a wonderful spot.

The apartment was better than imagined, more than was advertised. Cozy furniture, all the appliances necessary for basic cuisining, fast WiFi, a coffeeshop next door, spare towels and sheets; honestly all of our needs were anticipated and met.

Speaking of which, Menaf was an indescribably warm and thoughtful host. Fresh fruit in the fridge for us, very clear instructions of how to get to and in the apartment, checkins to make sure everything was going smoothly. If I ever become an AirBnB host, Menaf will be my role model!"
1096827,520284725,2019-08-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Great location if you like a quit green environment. Close to Tele2 Arena and metro (5 min walk) Will take you to city centre in 15 min.

Karin n'était pas présente sur Stockholm lors de notre séjour mais elle a été disponible et joignable en cas de besoin."
916806,506983721,2019-08-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Im Grunde genommen ein schönes Apartment. ABER: Dreck in der Dusche, eine viel zu laute Ablaufpumpe und Lärm von der Wohnung darüber haben das Gesamt gedrückt. Auf den Bildern viel schöner und größer als in echt!"

The apartment was spacious and had all the amenities we needed.  The location was central and easy walking to interesting areas.  The food hall a short walk away was unbelievable.  Would definitely recommend!!
897584,6365704,2013-08-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Fuimos con dos niños a Estocolmo y el apartamento de Viveka fue perfecto! Es pequeño pero amplio, con todo lo necesario, tanto para dormir como para comer. Además, está exquisitamente decorado, lo que lo hace especialmente acogedor! Tiene una terraza preciosa que da a un pequeño bosque en el que vimos un cervatillo. 
Tiene una parada de bus delante mismo. Para ir en metro, está un poco más lejos, pero lo bueno es que al lado tiene un supermercado que abre hasta las 23h, ideal para comprar la cena y el desayuno del día siguiente. 
Viveka es muy atenta: nos vino a recoger en la parada de metro para enseñarnos cómo llegar en autobús a casa. Nos ofreció incluso comida que tenía en la despensa. 
Un 10."
1149820,85045971,2016-07-10T00:00:00.000Z,"I stayed with a friend at Klara's apartment and it was perfect for two people. Communication was always excellent, Klara gave us a lot of good tips both before and during our stay. The apartment is very clean and quiet, the bed super comfortable, we slept very well. The area has lots of great records shops, second hand shops, nice places to eat. I highly recommend Klara's place for your visit to Stockholm!"
954832,191059378,2017-09-06T00:00:00.000Z,"We really enjoyed our stay at Mikael's place. It was bigger than expected, plenty of room for 2 adults & a 2 year old (after a little toddler proofing). Mikael was a fantastic host - very clear communication and able to help with lots of things from providing maps & brochures to collecting mail. He even had a teddy bear and cars waiting for our son! The place is very warm inside so no need for heavy pjs. The location is fantastic - just a short walk to the metro and local shopping/eating. Highly recommend a stay here."
785218,291767415,2018-07-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Het huis van Fredrik is een prima uitvalsbasis om Stockholm te verkennen.  Het huis is ruim genoeg voor 6 personen en alle voorzieningen zijn aanwezig en van prima kwaliteit. Tijdens ons verblijf was het heel warm, door de nabij gelegen snelweg is buiten zitten op het balkon eigenlijk geen optie. Geen probleem, de nabij gelegen zwemgelegenheid is een perfect alternatief."
700113,116903764,2016-12-04T00:00:00.000Z,Perfect small central apartment for a weekend in the city.
624886,250194765,2018-04-04T00:00:00.000Z,"We loved so much about this place! We are a family with two young kids and it was a perfect set up for our family with a great playground and park down the street and easy access to the Hornstull tbana as well as bus options. Oskar thoughtfully recommended we use the Flyggbussarna airport bus from Arlanda. What a convenience just a few minutes walk from the flat. We enjoyed exploring the neighborhood (if you are looking for a grocery store the somewhat hidden Hemkop in the mall at the Hornstull tbana had a huge selection of all kinds of goods, way more than the ICAs around.) We enjoyed some of the local restaurant options and getting a feel for neighborhood life. Transit wise, the Hornstull stop offered such great and easy  access to all of Stockholm, just 10 min or so to Gamla Stan. Our only advice would be to make sure you have lots of details about finding the apartment in terms of address and floor since we had some trouble finding the place. All in all a highly recommended location for a city stay in Stockholm, especially for families!"
1124388,90367871,2016-07-31T00:00:00.000Z,"Нам понравился Карл, он был очень открытым и гостеприимным, и постарался сделать все, чтобы сделать наше пребывание комфортным, обеспечивал нужной информацией, и был всегда на связи. Карл очень интересуется русской культурой, много знает о нашем кино - было здорово с ним пообщаться на эту тему. Книг великое количество - на всемозможные темы! 
Еще, нам понравилось, что нет телевизора - зато такая классная аудиосистема, мы постоянно местноеьрок-радио слушали по утрам, а по вечерам пластинки. Романтика:)
Квартира маленькая, но там есть все, что нужно, все очень функционально! Нам не хватило только микроволновки, но и то пару раз всего.
Район очень тихий и маленький - обошла его весь за 20 минут вокруг. Окружен водой, приятный для пробежек. Рядом магазин, где есть все.
Удобно добираться до любых мест, езды минут 15 до Гамла Стана. 
В общем, рекомендуем.
Спасибо, Карл!)"

He's in London when I arrived Stockholm, although I've not read the house manual carefully so I met some troubles, Menaf still very patient to tell me about the house. The house is cozy and tidy, really proper for tourists which are 1 or 2 persons. Briefly, I strongly recommend Menaf's house."
624886,499212013,2019-07-31T00:00:00.000Z,"We travelled as a family of 5, with three kids ages 6,4 and a baby. Oskar’s apartment was perfect for us! Good sized space for a city apartment, cosy feeling and cool decoration. Large fridge and well equipped kitchen. Location was great, very near Hornstull underground station and near a large supermarket and shops. The playground across the street was amazing in hot weather as it had a little pool for the kids. Oskar was super helpful and responsive quickly to any questions. Would definitely return and recommend."
1212891,241457233,2018-03-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud's place was great! Maud was very friendly and helpful - and the location is really nice!  The apartment is in a quiet neighborhood, but very close to the metro and easy to get to anywhere in Stockholm!"
1251466,66246315,2016-03-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Dean was very nice and friendly. He picked us up at the metro station when we first arrived. His place is quite far from the city but its not a problem for us since the metro station is just a few minutes walk from his house. Overall, we had a nice and comfortable stay at Dean's house!"
242188,94641936,2016-08-16T00:00:00.000Z,"I spent 4 lovely and relaxing nights in Lidia's single room. 

The rooms are located on the upper level of her 2-story apartment. There is one single room and 2 double rooms. There is one bathroom for all three rooms. There are locks on all the doors and a common area equipped with a mini-fridge, hot water heater, eating utensils and a microwave. Great wifi and quite clean.   Had no problem with the other guests and with sharing a bathroom. Great experience. 

Room: cozy and cute. I didn't spend much time there so the size of the room did not bother me at all. Lidia was great and made sure the trash was emptied every day. I had enough towels, a water glass and she even made my bed. :). There is a desk in the room with 2 lamps along with an overhead lamp. The room faces a playground area/park so sometimes you will hear kids playing soccer but it was not a problem for me. It does get plenty of light (I actually had sunshine during my trip to Stockholm) so it made me wish I had brought my eye mask.  

Location: Great location. Public transportation (T-bana & bus stops) around the corner. Near yummy bakeries and delicious coffee houses. I had an early morning cruise on the Viking Line. It was an easy 30-min walk to their harbor. She lives on the 5th floor of her building but there is a great elevator. 

Lidia is a great host and she wants to be a resource to her guests. She gave me great directions to her apartment from Arlanda. Once I arrived, we had coffee and she talked to me about Stockholm and all that it has to offer. She was very kind and you can tell she enjoy hosting us tourists. It was nice to come home to a friendly face -- she even remembered some of my random Stockholm travel plans!  Thank you, Lidia."

Ilona was very helpful and was able to accommodate a late evening check in when my flight was delayed! The flat was only a few minutes walk away from multiple types of transit, including airport commuter train, airport bus, local metro, local bus, etc."
776012,498820963,2019-07-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Majken and Emil's place is in an ideal location, right in the center of the historic district of Stockholm.  It's near the Palace, the main square, restaurants, anything you might want is just steps away.  There's a narrow circular stairway (about 73 steps ; ) leading to the top floor apartment, which has a lovely view over the rooftops of the old town.  Majken and Emil kindly met us when we arrived and showed us around the apartment.  It's absolutely charming!  So authentic and with lots of character.   It was lovely and clean and had everything we needed (although my 6'2\" husband did have to slightly duck going through doorways).  Majken and Emil were perfect hosts and provided a useful list of local restaurants.  We loved walking around Gamla Stan early in the day when the streets were quiet, before the tourists converged.  We used the Slussen ferry to get to neighboring islands.  It ran frequently and was very convenient. We particularly enjoyed the photography and Vasa museums, Skansen and the Palace.  We tried half the restaurants on Majen's list and they were all great!  Although maybe not for everyone, I liked running (well, maybe a fast walk) up the stairs to get my heart rate up - a nice little interval workout. All in all, we had a wonderful week in Stockholm! It's a beautiful city with lots to do.  But my fondest memory will be how incredibly nice everyone was, including our lovely hosts, who made our stay just perfect.  Thank you so much!"
442837,24628232,2014-12-31T00:00:00.000Z,"Although I didn't actually meet Jo, her mother was more than accommodating and checked me in with loads of tips and suggestions for exploring stockholm. I really felt at home here and had everything I needed for my short stay in Stockholm, but I imagine this would be a great place to stay longer as well. The location couldn't be more convenient coming from the train station and even getting to the airport. I had a great time and would recommend this space to anyone."
1182616,167545767,2017-07-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Very close to public transportation, right next to grocery store, shops, and restaurants. There were also a few nice parks nearby. If you like to walk, it's only a half-hour walk to Gamla Stan and lots of museums.  Peter was very nice and accommodating. The check-in/check-out process was super flexible and easy.  I would definitely stay here again."
1041103,13812275,2014-06-05T00:00:00.000Z,"This was a great place to spend couple of days in Stockholm, with nice access to transportation via metro line and bus. Neighbourhood was quiet, with a supermarket nearby, and 15 minutes from the city center. The apartment was exactly as described, fairly clean with a fully functional kitchen, wireless internet, etc. The only things missing was actually a hair dryer (might be a problem in the winter) and microwawe oven (which isn't healthy after all). Some might say it was a little bit cluttered with stuff, but that's what you would expect from a place where a whole family lives when there are no guests. This can even add to the feeling of being home in a foreign city.

Our hosts, Karoline and his husband were great, they welcomed us when we arrived quite late and was happy to help when we required some assistance.

Overall this place is great for a couple of people heading to Stockholm for a congress (like our party), or for a family looking to spend some time in this nice city."

The location was great as the metro was only a few blocks away. If you are looking for a good place to eat in the area I recommend The Greasy Spoon for brunch and Jim & Jacob for dinner. Both were excellent and within a close walk."

Ali was very friendly and answered every mail I wrote him very fast and helpful. I would stay there again, but only together with somebody, because it's a kind of suburb, where are more men then women on the street and I felt kind of watched, especially at night.

313763,183357941,2017-08-17T00:00:00.000Z,Martin was a great host and the apartment was just as nice as it looked on the  photos. He had some nice tips on things to do and see in Stockholm.

Really central yet very peaceful. If it is free, I would wholeheartedly recommend a stay in this apartment. Go for it!"
954832,82462144,2016-06-27T00:00:00.000Z,We stayed at Mikael's place for 9 days. Mikael was welcoming and helpful! The apartment was clean & bright. The location was very convenient to explore Stockholm & the surrounding area. Excellent host!

1212891,198406025,2017-09-29T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a great time staying at Mauds. She was massively helpful in getting us from the airport to her place, and it's located very close to a well served metro station. It's also quiet enough whilst also being close to shops. The flat is very well organised and we had a great time using it as a base to explore the city or just spending the evening in cooking and eating. Also, Sammy is a great host cat!"
206221,153463947,2017-05-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Please add us to the list of those with many kudos for Elisabeth - she's warm, engaging, cultured and will tell you all the best places to visit in stunning Stockholm.  We enjoyed the spacious, quiet bedroom and fantastic breakfasts.  And it was nice to have an elevator.  There's one bathroom with a bath and one of those shower heads on a flexible hose, but it's also spacious and there was never a problem sharing.  The T-bana (Metro) is nearby (0.6 km) but we enjoyed the pretty walk to the Royal Palace (2.2 km) and downtown (2.8 km) areas.  It's an expensive city so check out the lunch specials during the work week and invest in the Stockholm Pass if you like museums (there are many good ones) and boat trips."
739726,19033058,2014-09-05T00:00:00.000Z,Thanks Sanna for a great apartment - it was exactly as described - with very clear directions on how to find - wonderfully located and within walking distance of everything - I only used public transport to go to the archipelago. The apartment is beautiful - very quiet even though so well located. I am already planning a return trip.
164448,2114849,2012-08-27T00:00:00.000Z,"This was the first time using airbnb, we were very impressed with Lidia.

Lidia is a well educated women whom you feel exstremely comfortable with, could not have been better, thank you. 

Ps The internet was very strong and breakfast was well worth the money."
608672,1978665,2012-08-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Great apartment, very clean, nicely decorated and centrally located in Stockholm. Karl was very nice, helping us find our way in the apartment and the city (with a city map). There is a entrance to the room, separated from the rest of the house. The room is furthermore separated from the house by doors that are blocked."
647314,61637633,2016-02-07T00:00:00.000Z,"The location, with just a few steps away from a underground station, was perfect to explore Stockholm. The whole apartment is cosy and quiet, perfect to chill out after a strenious day of sightseeing. Södermalm is a charming neighbourhood full of bars, cafés and small shops. Mallika was a helpful host and made sure everything was good."
647314,189314144,2017-09-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Mallika's flat is in a really nice area of Stockholm, close to restaurants, pubs, subaway and rail station. During my stay she was out of town but we've been always in touch for every needs.
Recommended"
1124388,16974102,2014-08-05T00:00:00.000Z,"We were 3 people staying for 10 nights in Carl's apartment. We found everything very comfortable, and the location is perfect since with the bus n. 1 you can reach the central station and the underground.
We had enough space to cook and eat and to sleep, even if we found the room slightly small for 3 people... But it is enough comfortable to stay in just for the night and other few moments. We are sure that for 2 people is even better.
Carl was very kind to us and gave us precious infos to reach the house.
It has been a great experience and we all thank Carl for it."

She even helped us to work out the best way to travel from the airport and to a Mumma Mia restaurant we visited one evening.  Although we didn't meet Marie-Louise on the first day, we did meet her daughter, everything in the apartment was explained in detail and we felt at home immediately.  They had even bought some staple foods as a gift (milk, eggs, cheese, ham, butter, chocolates and crisps) it was a lovely thought and really helped us the first morning.  The area is lovely with a great supermarket nearby, its a short walk to a tube station which is only 5 stops from the town centre and there is a fantastic tapas bar at the end of the road.  I would not hesitate to recommend this appartment to others, even we want to return already!"

The house is fantastic, a real cozy oasis where it is easy to feel at home and relaxed.The weather was wonderfull, so we spent a lot os time in the cozy garden - a true adventure for our kids with all the things to play with.

1244657,184279727,2017-08-19T00:00:00.000Z,"La habitación está genial, es amplia y el apartamento en general está muy bien. La ubicación es inmejorable, se puede ir a pie a casi todos los museos y sitios de interés de Estocolmo. Justo en frente hay una parada de autobuses y a unos 300 metros una de metro. Nic y Usha son unos anfitriones estupendos, amables y te ayudan para sentirte como en casa... Repetiré!!!!!"

608672,31759131,2015-05-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Karl ist ein sehr sympatischer Gastgeber der uns früh das Zimmer reserviert hat (was andere nicht bereit waren zu tun) und uns eine tolle Beschreibung gesendet hat. Die Lage ist perfekt in der Nähe einiger netter Restaurants,Bars und Läden. Auch der Rest ist in Gehweite oder super mit der Metro (quasi vor der Haustür) zu erreichen. Das Zimmer war gross genug für uns 2 Cousinen, mit einem gemütlichen Bett. Die Dusche ist nicht top,aber es geht (alles wird etwas nass,trotz der Vorrichtung). Wir haben eine Flasche gekühltes Wasser bekommen, sowie eine Büchse Kaviar :-). Danke Karl für die tollen 2 Tage!"
1261445,19266202,2014-09-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Marie-Louise and her daughter were at the apartment when we arrived and gave us a very warm welcome.  They explained how everything worked and where to find things.  They even left bowls of chips and sweets for us and also fruit, which I thought was very thoughtful.

The apartment was small but bigger than a hotel room and very charming.  The bed was a queen size and very comfortable.  The bathroom with the Stockholm shower was a little awkard but adequate for our needs.

We choose the area to be near relatives in Stockholm but would like staying there regardless.  It was close to the tunnelbanna, shops and restaurants.  The street was quiet considering it's central location and even the bells from the church opposite did not disturb us. It is a very nice area and just a short walk away is Langholmen where there is water, a beach and parkland.  We had a family picnic there.

I would have no trouble recommending this apartment for it's character and location.  Marie-Louise was a charming host and the apartment was very clean and comfortable."
533880,10610016,2014-02-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Jarl was relaxed in de omgang en met het beschikbaar stellen van de sleutel, afhandelen van de kamer (mochten tot in de avond de kamer gebruiken), nam de tijd om onze vragen over Stockholm te beantwoorden en was sociaal. Kamer was ruim voldoende om te overnachten. Het was schoon genoeg en we hebben ons niet beperkt gevoeld door zijn dagritme en aanwezigheid."
755843,448401268,2019-05-05T00:00:00.000Z,Pär is very friendly and has provided us with very useful information. I recommend to all
299154,18789179,2014-09-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Daniel was a friendly host, the location of the apartment was ideal (seconds from the T-Bana, walk to Gamla Stan and the Djurgården ferry). We were in town for a music festival and being able to come back to a comfortable bed and hot, powerful shower was the best!! Oh and the balcony was perfection! We ate out there every day!"
451155,6453671,2013-08-13T00:00:00.000Z,Malin's house is very nice and comfortable in a beautiful and quiet neigbourhood. Great for a family with little children. Downtown Stockholm is quickly reached via the nearby metro station where you also can find a supermarket. Recommended!

442837,346315397,2018-11-08T00:00:00.000Z,Jo’s place was right on top of the Metro station. Close to Liljeholmen shopping mall. A pleasant stay altogether.
875505,46662495,2015-09-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Like many of the other reviews mentioned, the location of this apartment is really ideal and extremely centrally located. Close to everything you might need/want for Stockholm!

Electra met me upon my arrival (which was late) and she was extremely nice and accommodating. The apartment is very nice and the pictures are accurate, though she has upgraded the bed to a sleeper/sofa that is very comfortable and converts to a chaise lounge when not a bed. As Electra mentions, it's extremely quiet for it being so centrally located as it's on a smaller side street. 

I highly recommend this apartment and Electra as a host!"
242188,26256763,2015-02-08T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment is located in a quiet part of Södermalm and very accessible to the public transport, near to the train and metro, but also near to Sofo, the area of this island full of restaurants and good atmosphere.
Lidia prepared us nices breakfasts in the morning and gave us great tips for visiting. She was pleasant, well informed about Stockholm and talkative in general culture, so we had really good conversations.
Very comfortable accommodations, with a nice common room for the guests. Highly recommended. I felt like home and enjoyed the city a lot. Thanks!"
536691,80343649,2016-06-17T00:00:00.000Z,Everything was prepared for us - we didn't meet Cecilia but the keys were left with all the information we needed. The flat and the location were incredible - the flat is spacious with little balconies front and back to get the sun at any time of day - and it's within walking distance of Gamla Stan though the metro is so close and so good you don't need to worry about walking. We had a great time and would certainly go back there.
1234109,41305091,2015-08-07T00:00:00.000Z,The host canceled this reservation 78 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
278311,788488,2011-12-16T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment is very well connected to the center of Stockholm. Within 15 minutes Pendelstag (suburban train) and 25 minutes by Metro, with no changes to the T-Centralen. The apartment is comfortable and has access to the subway, train, bus and supermarket nearby.
Linnea is a woman comfortable that makes you feel at home. It was a complete success for choosing this apartment in my stay in Sweden."
1212891,34762687,2015-06-12T00:00:00.000Z,"This is my first airbnb experience, and it is really great to have Maud as a host. I really feel like being at a friend's house, clean and easy. Maud is very nice and helpful. The small kitchen is also perfect because I can cook for my self everyday. The metro station and supermarket is just nearby, and the best part of the community is that the waterfront is in 3 mins walking distance. I walk along the waterfront every evening and feel really peace and relaxed. Because of this experience, I am sure I will use airbnb as a first choice for future trips."

1251466,75653083,2016-05-22T00:00:00.000Z,The host did pick us up and told us some information about direction. The neighbourhood was very nice and clean. The flat is a couple of minutes walk from the metro station
581243,83126903,2016-07-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin's place was very easily accessible on public transport, with the complex right outside a train station and bus stops. It seemed like a nice area and the apartment was secure in a swipecard access only area. 
I was out a lot but when I was home Edwin was very friendly and asked if there was anything he could do to help me with my sightseeing plans or to make ,y stay more comfortable. The apartment was spotless and very comfortable, with a nice bathroom and large room."

The apartment itself is exactly as pictured, the bedrooms are comfortable, the kitchen is incredibly spacious, the bathroom is amazing, and the living room is incredibly inviting. Madeleine has amazing taste, and it shows in all the beautiful accents one finds in each room. Madeleine was also very easy to communicate with, and made our stay very welcome. She also did a great job leaving information about the apartment and things to do in Stockholm. Thanks Madeleine!"
723539,43966124,2015-08-23T00:00:00.000Z,The listing was exactly as described.

The location of the apartment itself was ideal, right on the north end of Sodermaln (quite close to Gamla Stan and T-Centralen).

I was given separate cupboard, freeze shelf, towels and bed. The owner is the nicest person you ever can meet. You will feel like home away from home. The vicinity of T-banna and shops made the whole experience better."

757320,12344424,2014-04-29T00:00:00.000Z,The room and bathroom was very clean. The bed was comfortable. The location of the apartment is perfect. We were a little surprised when Barb opened the door to our room one morning without waiting for our response ... we were still in bed .. Otherwise the stay was perfect!

This was my second stay here and going to Stockholm I would never stay anywhere else, highly recommended!"
916806,113323749,2016-11-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice studio flat in a safe, friendly neighbourhood. Supermarkets, shopping centre nearby. Accommodation had everything you could want for a short stay, description and photos were accurate. Would definitely stay again."

700113,52897356,2015-11-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Illona met us at her house when we arrived. Was planning to go to Stockholm alone, but after I made the reservation my mom decided to come along. Illona offered ut a spare bedroom for just a small extra cost. 

The studio apartment was convenient; The kitchen was big enough for making a small en easy breakfast to the two of us, but it wasn't well enough equipped so I would consider it more as a «tea-kitchen» - but no problem for us as we went out for dinner every day. The bathroom was reasonable sized and more important; very clean. The living room / sleeping area had a lot of space and it was very nice to be able to open the balcony door during the night, if it got very hot. Even though the studio is very centrally located, it's placed in a street next to one of the main streets (Sveavägen) and therefore very silent by night.

The bedroom was in Illonas own apartment, but that wasn't any problem. We were glad to have separate sleeping areas, and the bedroom was big and comfortable."
155685,36681998,2015-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Robert made us feel very welcomed.  He was flexible and made arrangements for key pick-up without us having to meet him.

Vidhatri sent us  very exact and detailed instruction to get to their home. They show us a great respect by preparing a homemade breakfasts and coffee every morning. We could choose and we used a chance to try Indian food. We loved it! This was our first Airbnb experience and it was very good one.

She helped us out with places to eat and things to do / see as soon as we arrived so we were able to maximise our time in Stockholm. Her flat is in a great location with enough restaurants and trendy cafes to suit every taste. We were easily (within 10mins) able to walk to both Gamla Stan and the unique fashion shops and bars of Södermalm. The ferry stop to the Vasamuseet is also a short walk away. Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable stay in a lovely flat with a top-notch hostess."

Lidia was the best host ever: she was very flexible with the times of arriving and leaving, she gave us plenty of information on how to reach her house in the most convenient way and also about what to do and see around Stockholm, but at the same time she wasn´t intrusive at all. She is one of the kindest lady I have ever met, I really hope to come back one day!"

I made my itinerary based on her advice and I loved the experience :) I only stayed for the weekend so I don’t have enough time to visit everything.

Les alentours ont l'air magnifiques."

Nettan war bei der Planung meines Aufenthalts in jeder Weise unterstützend. Ich war mit dem Auto in Stockholm und hatte Parkprobleme, weil das Parken in Stockholm sehr teuer ist. Auch für dieses Problem hat Nettan eine Lösung gefunden. Insofern kann ich sie voll weiterempfehlen."
608672,120286437,2016-12-09T00:00:00.000Z,Karl was a thoroughly lovely host.

Thomas is a friendly and welcoming  host, giving good information, picking us up from the public transport terminal when we arrived and making sure we had a well-stocked fridge. From the apartment, it's easy to get into central Stockholm by bus (3 mins away and very frequent) and then a short train journey. 
Thanks for a great stay!"
954832,247322662,2018-03-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Mikael’s place is clean, spacious for a studio apartment, great value and also in a really nice and quiet location in Stockholm.  It is not too far from main attractions / transport in the city. There are also nice restaurants and cafes around the area. 

Mikael was also an excellent host and was always quick and available to communicate. We even had two delayed flights and arrived much later than we had planned. He stayed up for us and made sure we got in safely. I would most definitely stay here again in Stockholm, but you do need to walk or take a bus to get closer to the city center if that is what you are expecting."
1153177,47034844,2015-09-15T00:00:00.000Z,Terrys lägenhet i Östermalm är perfekt att upptäcka Stockholm. Det går bra att sova i lägenheten med familj med 3 barn. Lägenheten är nära Djurgården och nära T-bana. Det är faktiskt perfekt!
242188,166269383,2017-07-03T00:00:00.000Z,I had a great experience at Li's home. I can understand why she is a superhost. She let me know on on my way in that the commuter train was out of service and gave me an alternative route to get to her home. She also went over places for me to go in Stockholm. The room of course was in great condition and in a quiet neighborhood. I had the privilege of sitting down and talking with Li and a family member during my stay which just added to an already memorable experience in Stockholm. Would definitely recommend Li's home to anyone travelling to Stockholm.

Check-in was super convenient; he was waiting at the flat when we arrived. Communication was impeccable; I got responses to all my messages within 10 mins pretty much (certainly within 30 mins). He even answered questions throughout my stay about restaurant recommendations and other tips (his recommendations were stellar!). He also helped me print my boarding pass. The place was very clean, with all the basic amenities. There is nothing not to like about this place. 5/5 across the board."

The apartment is very nice, just as it looks from the photographs. Area is quiet and very nice with lots of open space and green for the kids. 

We thought from the map that it would be further from downtown, but it ended being closer than we had anticipated. In the end we just walked everywhere and didn't even take public transport any single day.

Highly recommended apartment and host."
873383,156403363,2017-05-30T00:00:00.000Z,"I stayed during one month at Isabelle's place. She was a fantastic host, very friendly and easy going. She gave me many advices and invited me multiple times to join her and her friends. I was in stockholm to work at karolinska institutet. The place is well located with quick access to metro in a very calm neighborhood. She has two lovely cats. I highly recommend Isabelle's place for your stay."

Madeleine provided that to us not only through her beautifully and tastefully curated home, but her attention to detail, constant communication and information about the neighborhood. She helped us to acclimate without missing a beat. For the 5 days that we spend here, we felt like it was our home. From having breakfast in the kitchen with the morning light shining through the windows to the ease and accessibility of markets, restaurants and the subway in one of Stockholm's coolest neighborhoods. Upon our departure, one of the things we would miss most is this apartment in Sodermalm. Thank you Madeleine for making our trip so memorable."
581243,2650666,2012-10-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin was a great communicator and even met us at the metro stop to help us find his place. Good local knowledge, giving us some great restaurant advice & transport tips. He even lent me a laptop while mine was being repaired!

The apartment is very well located with excellent rail and bus connections, and within walking distance of central Stockholm. The apartment was absolutely spotless and the facilites were all as listed.

I definitely recommend staying with Edwin if you're coming through Stockholm!"
916806,303458070,2018-08-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Julia’s apartment was the perfect base for our week stay in Stockholm.

As Julia has clearly stated, this is NOT a central Stockholm location - it was about 15 to 20 mins on the metro but this was ideal! Everything is close at hand. There was a shopping centre with a big supermarket located within a 5 minute walk of the apartment and it was lovely and quiet sitting out on the terrace at night, enjoying the views and a glass of wine.

The apartment has everything that you’ll need for a comfortable stay - we were able to cook for ourselves for a couple of nights and the washing machine was really handy too!

We would thoroughly recommend this apartment for a single traveller or a couple looking to explore the wonderful sights of Stockholm.

Thanks Julia!!"
581243,8653079,2013-11-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Staying at Edwin's was great. He met us as the metro station and was very welcoming. He made us feel like part of the family during our one night in Stockholm. The room was comfortable and clean, as was his flat. The area is out of the city centre but accessible everywhere in 7-10 minutes so very well situated. Can't recommend staying here highly enough - he was a super host."
1261445,73729798,2016-05-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Marie-Louise was a great host and her home is fabulous. The apartment is well designed and very functional. Lots of good towels and soft bed linen. The bathroom is small but that's not a problem, you can still have a good hot shower. Little touches like flowers and bowls of fruit were really appreciated. Hornstull was a good base, close to the tube and the bus frm airport stops about 5 minutes from apartment. Will definitely go back next time we visit family in Stockholm."
1117037,277932614,2018-06-17T00:00:00.000Z,Polina's place is very clean and spacious. Polina was very friendly and welcoming. The room is big with a comfortable bed. It was ideal for my trip as in walking distance (30 minutes) of the conference centre Stockholmsmassan. Also very easy to get into Stockholm city by train from Hogdalen.
1251466,20270436,2014-09-26T00:00:00.000Z,Dean was a very nice and polite host. We had our own room and an own key and were free to use the kitchen for cooking. We enjoyed our stay very much :)

608672,81729508,2016-06-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Although my stay here was short, I enjoyed it very much. Karl was an extremely welcoming host. Even when I got lost after a very long day of traveling and was a few hours late to check-in, he came outside to meet me and took my suitcase (which was broken) up to the studio. The apartment was clean and cozy, and the neighborhood was beautiful, quiet, and as the listing mentions, in a great location!"
819676,142637951,2017-04-09T00:00:00.000Z,Andy and Vannie are a sweet couple. Both were really welcoming and nice. The apartment is located perfectly to explore the city. Only a few walking minutes to the hot spots of Stockholm. Everytime again!

Super friendly and well communicative."
1182616,125181239,2017-01-04T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a nice stay, the check-in and check-out were really easy. Wifi was good as well. There's a metro station around the corner, which I took to get in the centre, its just a few stops but walking is definitely too far."
608672,95029079,2016-08-18T00:00:00.000Z,Jättetrevligt boende. Bra bemötande och Karl gav goda tips på aktiviteter i Stockholm. Boendet var mycket mysigt och absolut perfekt vid en visit till huvudstaden. Toppbetyg från oss!
608672,9461681,2013-12-30T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed at Carls place for a few days at the end of december 2013. As we were told in advance, Carl was on vacation, but his son Gabriel welcomed us very friendly. The bedroom was clean and fairly furnished, just like the pictures show. The bed was comfortable, with a super soft mattress. We never used the kitchen, because it's too small for two, but it would be fine to make coffee and simple snacks. The shower takes a bit getting used to, since there is no water basin, but it's bearable. We just didn't like it, that the bathroom door would not lock. As guests you need to consider that the apartment walls are thin like paper. We could hear quite well when there were people talking text-door, but we didn't feel disturbed. In fact we had a really nice stay and can absolutely recommend this place! Not to forget, the location is great."
1041103,4942894,2013-06-03T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a great stay at Karolines apartment. It is easy to get to the city (by bike or by metro), well equiped, clean, perfect for our group and very child friendly.  And on top we had a very warm welcome, including breakfast for the next morning. Thank you!
Beside the metro which is just around the corner, there are also some restaurants, a supermarket, a bakery and a really good coffee place just across the street. We rented bikes and enjoyed cycling in Stockholm."
164448,529210012,2019-09-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Li was warm and welcoming with a cup of tea when I arrived and gave me a run down of the local transit, points of interest and navigating in Stockholm. The place was clean, cozy, and quiet. She was easily available, but also gave me space and privacy. There is one other room she rents out, but I hardly noticed the other person and this didn’t district my stay at all. This was well located and near groceries and transit. I was able to easily get downtown and to my conference at the south of the city without issue. Would stay here again if I am ever in Stockholm. Thanks Li!"
541875,6997179,2013-09-02T00:00:00.000Z,the small studio was very clean and had all what we needed for the 5 days we stayed (Website hidden by Airbnb) is very well situated and  close to Metro and bus lines. Martin was very kind and waited for us at the main train station and brought us to his flat. By drinking coffee with him he gave us some good tips for stockholm.I can definitely recommend him and would go there for another time.
819676,529206622,2019-09-14T00:00:00.000Z,"My boyfriend and I stayed at this apartment for three nights. The location is great! Sodermalm is a fun area which also has a good connection to the rest of stockholm via metro. Andy was home during our stay and we spent two evenings chatting with him and getting local tips. The apartment itself is very clean and has a nice interior. The room is small, but perfect for a short stay, and you have your own bathroom. Would definitely recommend this place to my friends! Thanks Andy!"
755843,444525008,2019-04-28T00:00:00.000Z,We really enjoyed staying his apartment!! Great location and spacious room!  We are not able to see him this time but his instruction was really clear and helpful. We had a wonderful time at Stockholm. Highly recommended.

1048260,442785219,2019-04-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Great place for a solo traveler or couple! Annika's place was spacious for a studio, and was in a great location - right down the street from Gullmarsplan station where you can catch 3 different train lines + buses to wherever you need to go! Annika was extremely responsive and easy to communicate with, I had no problems with check-in despite being one day late due to a cancelled flight! Would definitely recommend."

Anette greeted us the day we arrived and graciously showed us around her home which was perfect for me, my wife, and our daughter during our week-long stay in Stockholm.  It is within walking distance to many great restaurants/bars, two grocery stores, and a train station -- what more could we ask for?"
533880,53772742,2015-11-12T00:00:00.000Z,Jarl was a great host. He has arranged my arrive and my stay so nice and smoothly. The apartment was very clean and the location was  perfect. Jarl was very friendly and nice to talk. Excellent stay in the town!
533880,6401277,2013-08-11T00:00:00.000Z,The flat is not far from the metro station and the center of the city. Jarl is very nice and his bicycle cards were useful. So I recommand this address.

Edwin's wife was kindly waiting for us for check in, and we're very thankful for that. Property is VERY CLEAN and it was a pleasure to stay in Edwin's room.

1231897,44733761,2015-08-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Experience was Alex was great.  Getting to Alex's place from Stockholm Central was relatively straightforward.  Alex has a nice clean room and bed.  The bathroom was clean and the shower was hot.  Best part of the experience was meeting Alex, and checking out Stockholm through his eyes.  Alex was also great with organising a washing machine and dryer so I could do laundry.  If you're coming to Stockholm, I'd recommend Alex's place!"
1212891,79298434,2016-06-12T00:00:00.000Z,Maud is very helpful. The house is nice.

299154,257234074,2018-04-25T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment was in our favourite location in Stockholm, near all the best bakeries and venues. Daniel was also very accommodating with flexible check-ins and check-outs. Would definitely stay there again!"

Location: very central in Stockholm. There's tons of great restaurants around.

Interior: nicely and very functionally decorated.

Communication, etc.: Very good. Gustav waited for me at the apartment, we had a nice chat (he recommended me a terrific Swedish restaurant), and then left me to enjoy the apartment."
608672,268556488,2018-05-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Eccezionale accoglienza oltre ogni aspettativa, anche nel proporre escursioni che a noi, non del luogo, sarebbero rimaste totalmente sconosciute.  Parlando perfettamente l'italiano (essendo vissuto diversi anni in Italia), il Sig K. è stato un ottimo filtro fra noi e Stoccolma. I problemi relativi al bagno, di cui eravamo perfettamente a conoscenza  da altre recensioni , sono stati facilmente superati con un certo spirito di adattamento. Il Sig. K. ci ha spiegato del resto che nel palazzo in cui è presente l'appartamento, essendo storico,   non è possibile ottenere facilmente permessi di  modifica o ristrutturazione dallo stato iniziale. In ogni caso giudizio nettamente positivo che ha reso il nostro soggiorno a Stoccolma, città meravigliosa,  ancora più gradevole."
974175,59146101,2016-01-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Wir haben uns bei Sofie & Jesper sehr wohl gefühlt. Die Wohnung ist für 5-6 Personen komfortabel, die Betten auch für Erwachsene wunderbar. Dass es nur ein Bad bzw. eine Toilette gibt, erfordert ein wenig Koordination, aber die Vorteile der Wohnung machen dies wett. Die große Küche mit Esstisch lädt mit vielen Highlight zu gemütlichen Abenden ein, an Ausstattung hat man alles was das Herz begehrt. Der große Garten und das Haus waren sehr gepflegt. Die Lage der Wohnung ist optimal, um Stockholm zu erkunden. Bus und Metro fahren nur wenige Meter entfernt ab, ab der Haltestelle Odenplan erreicht man alle wichtigen Punkte meist sogar ohne umsteigen. Wir würden definitiv wiederkommen!"
581243,111495958,2016-10-31T00:00:00.000Z,"Highly recommend. The room was clean, comfortable and ideally located. There's a bus stop ~ 2 min away and a subway station 5 min away. Short walk to sites like Historiska museet and Nordiska museet. Also, Edwin is such a nice host. Quick to respond, very informative and super sweet and nice. Would definitely stay again."

The apartment: very clean, nice, beautiful, carefully decorated with many amazing detailes. We got everything we need. Comfortable bed and sofa. Almost looks like my dream home :)

The location: on the best island - south island. very close to metro station. couple of mins walk you can reach the water, we did a evening walk there and the view and sunset was amazing.

Communication: Marie-Louise is super nice. Waited us at the apartment to give us the key. Very easy to communicate and always ready to help and respond. 

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
1204621,265511008,2018-05-17T00:00:00.000Z,Mycket bra boende! Trevligt bemötande och bra läge. Allt toppen!
283446,37230139,2015-07-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Vidhatri and her family are incredibly friendly and treat you like family; the hospitality was amazing and the energy is full of mirth. You definitely will start your days in the mornings with a full stomach!  I have learned lots of Swedish culture and how to make South Indian food, and without staying at Vidhatri I believe I might not have had such an amazing experience in Stockholm. 

The location is VERY convenient! Only a three minute walk to the train station, and you can take it directly into the center of the city! The windows are huge and inviting in the kitchen area so you can have a morning stretch while looking at the stretches of nature before you.

Overall: very pleasant! I believe it is the ideal place to stay during your visit to Stockholm.

Thank you, Vidhatri! I will return again soon."
1048260,131672338,2017-02-13T00:00:00.000Z,We had a great stay in the apartment and Annika is a nice host!

514210,33502854,2015-05-29T00:00:00.000Z,I stayed with my wife and my 6 months old child at Margaretas place for 5 days. All three of us really felt at home there because Margareta and her children made us feel very comfortable. Moreover Margareta is a great host.  Whenever we had questions Margareta helped us out. The room itself is very clean and nice to stay at. A few minutes walking from the house you have the centre of Sköndal where you have a supermarket and a bus going to a big Metro station that leads you to the city. In total you need less than 30 minutes to get to Stockholm centre. We definetely recommend a stay at Margaretas place when visiting Stockholm if you want to stay at a very comfy place with great people in a quiet city near Stockholm.
1182616,17771967,2014-08-17T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment is located on a good location. Contact with Peter  went pretty smooth. Although we agreed that my friend and I had to make up our own beds upon arrival (because Peter could not be at the apartment, something Peter let us know the day before arrival) we noticed that the room was just exactly as the previous guests had left it: with their used linnen stil on the bed, towels and so on. After we contacted Peter about this, he sent a friend to clean the room and from then on, everything was okay."
581243,109832996,2016-10-23T00:00:00.000Z,"the room was extremly clean, location is perfect, communication with Edwin was so easy, I highly recommend it."

She was extremely friendly and helpful and tried to make our stay as nice as possible. Her cat Sammy is very friendly. Maud rents out two rooms, the \"green room\" with a twin bed and the \"purple room\" and puts up screens around her bed in the living room at night. Sharing the bathroom was never an issue. The \"purple room\" has a nice big window, pretty orchids, a desk and area for hanging up some clothes, and a bed that's 120 cm wide (a standard full bed is about 135 cm). It's a pretty cozy room for two but certainly can work, especially for couples. We enjoyed our conversations with Maud and appreciated her kind and warm demeanor."
608672,206383880,2017-10-25T00:00:00.000Z,"L'appartamento di Karl si trova in un edificio storico, ben attrezzato e molto vicino alla metro e, se si vuole raggiungere il centro storico (Gamla Stan) a piedi si impiegano circa quindici minuti. L'interno dell'appartamento è semplice ma curato e pulito, unica pecca il bagno piccolino con la doccia scomoda (il proprietario ci ha informati che a breve farà dei lavori per sistemare il problema). Karl è stato gentile e disponibile, ci ha accolti personalmente nonostante fossero le due di mattina, e ci ha inoltre spiegato come visitare Stoccolma. Consigliato per il rapporto qualità-prezzo, considerando i costi elevati della città."
1124388,94935423,2016-08-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Великолепная квартира в отличном районе. Легко добраться до центра на автобусе, а в хорошую погоду можно прогуляться к достопримечательностям пешком.
Карл был очень гостеприимен. Он заранее проинструктировал как добраться из аэропорта и оставил всё необходимое для комфортного проживания."
1231897,189293174,2017-09-01T00:00:00.000Z,Everything was exactly as expected. We were moving between houses and stayed a bit more than 2 weeks. It's close to everything and perfectly connected to the city center through buses and subway. He is a very nice host and very flexible. Mega recommended!

I stayed for a long weekend with my husband and t suited us perfectly - it's a great base from which to explore Stockholm as you can get around very easily from the tube station that's very nearby.

We didn't meet Klara as her boyfriend met us at the station to drop off the keys, but she was in regular contact and gave us very clear instructions for how to find the apartment as well as tips for the local area.

I would recommend this apartment to anyone. We had a lovely stay!"
700113,317359604,2018-09-02T00:00:00.000Z,Excellent location. Clean place. Nice view of park. Dog nextdoor did bark nonstop for a bit one afternoon but think that was an aberration. IIona was very friendly and kindly allowed me to store my bags there until my flight later on the day I checked out. Highly recommend this place for your base to explore Stockholm!

954832,167036036,2017-07-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Would highly recommend Mikael's place. He was a very helpful and kind host with great communication. The apartment was spacious and had everything we needed. The kitchen area is not huge, as explained in the posting, but we did not cook so it didn't bother us. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was also very nice. The location was great. There are lots of great restaurants and cafes just a couple minutes walk from the apartment. It was about a 20 minute walk to the city center, with a lot of restaurants and shops along the way. The road is quite busy, so it is a little loud at night, but it is okay if you close the door. Mikael was also very helpful with reserving us a time slot to do laundry at the last minute and we really appreciated it! He also provided detergent. Very full service :) Overall, the listing is as shown and is very clean and comfortable in an excellent location."
916806,312882890,2018-08-24T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a really nice stay at Julia's place. It was exactly what we wanted. Close to the nature and not too far away from the city center (you'll have to count about 20 minutes with the subway + 10 minutes to get to the metro). The view is really nice and it's only 15-20 minutes walking distance from a wonderful beach. We also happened to meet a squirrel just in front of the house and a leveret and Bamby while walking in the woods (this made our little boy very happy).
The house has all you need and the washing machine is a plus. We didn't have the chance to meet Julia but she was easily reachable. We would definitely come back again."

536283,4450338,2013-05-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Paolo might be slightly disappointed but we did used china and we did slept on bed sheets) When we entered the apartment we found it absolutely lovely, clean and cozy so we just tried to return it back to Paolo in that initial look. The apartment suited us perfectly. Indeed, it is perfect in all possible senses: spacious enough for two, fully equipped, has a great location and Swedish charm. And when it comes to the charm, the old elevator in the building worth to be mentioned, too. It has a great location especially for those who'd like to stay in Södermalm, perhaps the most vibrant area in the city, during their visit to Stockholm. The Metro (Tunnelbana) station, supermarkets, pharmacy and variety of restaurants, cafes and pubs are all nearby, within 5 min walking distance. We also found a superb bakery just two blocks away. On the other hand, the street where apartment’s located is very quite. We were not disturbed by any noise neither from neighbors nor from the street during the night. 
Paolo is a great host as well. He answered to all requests with no delay, was precise and clear in his comments.  We tried hard but found nothing to complain about either the host or the apartment itself. Oh, wait, there was one thing: having found any possible kitchen stuff, including torch for creme brulee, we could not find but one small kitchen knife which was a bit difficult to use, especially with the bread. Next time when we come we’ll ask Paolo for one of his beautiful Japanese knifes we are sure he has somewhere!"

757320,102829886,2016-09-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Overall we had a bad experience at Barb's house. Before our arrival she was really confused and quite rude to give us directions about her house and when we arrived (it was quite late but we had told her the time of our arrival when we booked the room) she seemed really unhappy to receive us. The other day we asked her if we could use the kitchen as it was announced and her answer was \"a little bit\". Moreover, the wifi did not work really well and the room was quite noisy during the night if the windows weren't shut, since the apartment is located in a big avenue. 
To be entirely fair, she warmed up to us towards the end of our stay. Despite all these facts, the room was clean and the bathroom was good."

Sam was very knowledgeable but most importantly shared information that is interesting and not dry about the history of the area. We learned lots and the Library of Congress was our favorite- so beautiful!

There was the food for breakfast for the few days. The neighborhood is quiet and pleasant, very close to downtown using the subway. Also easily accessible by car. We did not meet Melissa in person, but she was indeed available and nice and when we needed information :-)
Thank you Melissa."

Diana is a kind person; was very responsive and answered all my questions during the booking process. 
At the day of arrival, she welcomed us in the apartment, left the key and also some food for breakfast. Then, at the end of the stay she came back to pick up the key, at exactly appointed time.

The apartment looks just as described and shown in the pictures -  small, but well organized; fairly clean and the internet connection worked out perfectly. It is well suited for two persons, and a kid would fit perfectly :) (Yes, I missed my little son a lot, there was a spare bed in the room and a wonderful playground in front of the building). The apartment is located in a nice surrounding, 3min walk from the subway and about 20min ride to the city center.

Stockholm is a fascinating city. I will surely visit it again and I won't hesitate choosing Diana's flat again."

Die Küche hatte alles was man braucht, uns hat lediglich ein Wasserkocher gefehlt. 
Von den Nachbarn und der Straße hat man in der Wohnung nichts gehört. Lediglich die Fenster waren ein bisschen schwergängig zu schließen. 
Von der Wohnung aus war man schnell bei der U-Bahn-Station und war mit der Linie 14 schnell in der Innenstadt um diese zu erkunden. 
Die Kommunikation mit Anna war sehr einfach und unkompliziert. Sie hat schnell auf all unsere Fragen geantwortet und uns eine gute Anfahrtsbeschreibung vom Flughafen zur Wohnung geschickt, wodurch die Anfahrt keine Schwierigkeiten darstellte. 
Wir haben unsere Woche in Stockholm in Annas Apartment sehr genossen und können jedem nur empfehlen dort zu übernachten. 
Wem die Bilder von der Wohnung gefallen sollte auf jeden Fall mit Anna Kontakt aufnehmen."

The apartment is in a quieter part of town, but still walking distance or a short metro ride on the green line to Drottninggatan, Gamla Stan or Södermalm.  Ilona is a welcoming and friendly host, and the place is nice, comfy and clean. Very much recommended."
974175,9587527,2014-01-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Sofie's Stockholm apartment is beautiful. It really is a nice place and I couldn't recommend it more. Everything is modern and up to date and it is just very nice. Sofie was easy to deal with in all respects. The apartment is completely as described. The location is in a seemingly professional suburb. Generally, the area is devoid of grafiti or any kind of shabby appearance. Leaves a great first impression of Stockholm. The apartment is a two minute walk from the Odenplan subway stop and getting round Stockholm by public transport is easy. One caveat to all this is that we stayed as a family with two boys aged 12 and 15. I'd think twice about taking my boys to this apartment again because they can be less than graceful and the apartment is SO NICE we were on pins and needles much of time worrying they were going to break something. But overall, you'll love it. Best apartment we stayed in in three cities this time. And Stockholm is terrific !"

There is no door on the downstairs bedroom, which for some families may not be a big deal, but when you are traveling with friends or people you aren’t related to, it can be a bit odd. Other than that, the house was easy to get to by public transit and Jacob was very accommodating."

It is a very compact apartment, with a tiny kitchenette that has no running water or sink, which makes washing dishes rather laborious. The bathroom is also very small, with the shower flooding the floor. The bed is comfortable."
776012,167332159,2017-07-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Majken's place was perfect.  Central and so easy to access.

Die Gastgeberin ist über airbnb immer sofort  für alle anfallenden Fragen zu erreichen und  sehr entgegenkommend.
Wir haben uns dort sehr wohl gefühlt."

Ric is just the perfect host, he is pleased to tell you everything about the extremely nice neighborhood and suggest you good restaurants nearby. During my stay I was living in the upper floor, with an own bathroom, a nice bedroom and a balcony from where you have a beautiful sight of the waterside. Furthermore I was able to make full use of the kitchen as well.
The apartment is located in the beautiful area of Hammarby Sjöstad, it's perfect for walks arround the waterside. And you have the tramstation right in front of the house and need approx. 20 minutes to get into the city center.
I can fully recommend staying with Ric!"

I mis-read our arrival time and we got to the apartment hours earlier than I had communicated, and Marie-Louise was so gracious and kind about our unexpected arrival. Her flat is warm and cozy; a perfect retreat after spending hours in the cold, exploring the city.  She also provided so much food (and homemade jam!) that proved to be quite useful late in the evenings when it was too cold to go out. We would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Stockholm!"

The location is excellent.
One thing that I really felt terrible about this appartment is the bathroom, which we had to 'sweep' the water and mop the floor after shower.
After shower, again got wet with the sweat!
Wondered why Karl didn't do something effective for the bathroom for the guests."

242188,445887074,2019-04-30T00:00:00.000Z,Lee met me with all hospitality and gave me very useful advices for the city. Her house is in a beautiful  silent place and around 3 min from commute train station. So getting to the city center takes around 5-10 minutes. Also her house quite near to the hipster part of Stockholm around 10-15 min walk.  So you can easily access great pubs and venues where you can spend evening.

Perfect location, very well-connected to other parts of the city, nice and extremely cozy flat (what you see in the pictures shown is even better in the reality) with – really – ALL THE THINGS you need.
Pär is a very thoughtful host, he was amazingly helpful throughout the whole process and gave us the warmest welcome ever in Stockholm as well as all the informations and advices we needed. He did everything possible to make our stay enjoyable and so it was because it really felt like home! 
Check-in and check-out were simple and communication was always impeccable.

De verhuurde slaapkamer was niet groot, maar voorzien van ruim en goed bed. Ik voelde me welkom in het appartement van Jo, ook 2 vrienden die even op mij moesten wachten werden hartelijk binnen verwelkomt. De locatie is super, metrostation echt heel dichtbij.

The apartment worked really well with our family - very stylish whilst being easy to settle in.  Sonos and Apple TV are great additions.  The apartment is very well connected with the metro only a 5 minute walk (for a 3 year old) and the old town within 15 minutes on the metro.  There’s also a couple of supermarkets nearby and great restaurants."
