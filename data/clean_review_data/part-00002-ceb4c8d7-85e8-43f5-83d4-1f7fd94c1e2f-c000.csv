La chambre était impeccable et le logement très bien situé. Une maison pleine de charme !
Je recommande vivement"

242188,51713606,2015-10-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia is a most welcoming host, full of useful and interesting information about things to see round Stockholm. The accomodation is as described, comfortable, warm, very practical. The situation is perfect for visiting Gamla Stan and the surrounding areas, everything is within walking distance, and for those who prefer public transfer, the train station and bus stations are just round the corner. Also most appreciable is the free wifi connection, kettle, tea, coffee, fridge and microwave."

299154,81384260,2016-06-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Daniel's apartment is in a great location in Södermalm within an easy walk to Gamla Stan and quick subway travel to Central Stockholm. Daniel's Södermalm neighborhood also has lots to see and do, and his guidebook is very helpful in identifying parks, grocery stores and restaurants in the immediate vicinity. 

Daniel's is apartment is very compact, as he accurately describes, but it works perfectly. We fit three people on the two beds comfortably and still had room to maneuver around the small studio apartment. 

Daniel was also a great host, providing clear communication and prompt responses to our questions. Although we did not get to meet him directly, he was very accommodating with our arrival schedule, and we found the information he provided online and in the apartment very helpful.

Thanks for a wonderful stay in Stockholm!"
164448,339169565,2018-10-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia is an excellent host. She was really nice and gave us a lot of useful information. It's very easy to comunicate with her.
The appartement is well located, near the commuter rail and metro. The bedroom was comfortable and clean. Highly recommend !"

1170027,26267206,2015-02-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Jeg har kun roser at sige om Diana's lejlighed. Jeg kom fra Danmark og landede først i lejligheden kl 2 om natten hvor Diana og en veninde tålmodigt havde ventet på mig i timevis. De havde guidet mig gennem nattens snefaldet gader over telefonen. Selvom jeg var så sent på den var Diana sød og imødekommende.
Oveni havde hun købt brød, kaffe, juice mm. så jag havde lidt til om morgenen når jeg vågnede. Lejligheden var ren og lækker, en hyggelig lejlighed, der kunne rumme 3 mennesker uden problemer.
Næste gang jeg skal til Stockholm ved jeg hvor jeg skal bo"
755843,120890469,2016-12-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Perfect position near the centre, bus stops, underground, several nice restaurants."

954832,15137091,2014-07-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Nous avons apprécié l'accueil de Mikael qui a pris son temps pour nous présenter le logement, l'environnement et répondre à nos questions sur la ville de Stockholm.
L'appartement est bien situé, fonctionnel mais petit , il faudrait préciser dans le descriptif la surface; une télévision serait un plus !"
299154,28213237,2015-03-20T00:00:00.000Z,Daniel is a wonderful and very helpful host. The apartment was convenient for my meetings and in a quiet neighbourhood. Thank you for your hospitality Daniel
1231897,197630582,2017-09-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Perfect place to stay, welcoming and warm host and good connected with the city center by the underground."
916806,107643886,2016-10-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Bel appartement, très bien entretenu et confortable. Tout a bien été pensé , nous avons senti que nos hôtes sont soigneux et attentionnés. Le métro est à 10 bonnes minutes de marche, ainsi que les commerces. Il y a également de belles ballades à faire à pied dans le quartier."
1204621,196210804,2017-09-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Nettan was a great host. She texted me all the way I needed to do from the central station to go to her flat, which was really helpful.
She friendly welcomed me, tired as I was, and explained me where everything was at her flat and in the neighborhood. 
Her flat is three stations away from the central station, in a really quiet area close to the tube and the sea.
We had the chance to talk, even if both of us were quite busy, and it was great to know more about her.
Great first experience, thanks again !"
1182616,19763813,2014-09-17T00:00:00.000Z,"In an elegant and raised apartment; the host provided us with towels."
299154,19113617,2014-09-06T00:00:00.000Z,"My friend and I stayed at Daniel's place for one night and we found it very accommodating. We were drawn by the neighborhood and we truly enjoyed being there - it was so close to several train stations, shopping, trendy restaurants and boutiques. This was a no-frills place and we would definitely stay again."
242188,530871817,2019-09-16T00:00:00.000Z,Li... Is wonderful! You couldn't ask for a better host and a very thoughtful person. I would advise anyone to stay at her place and you will not be disappointed!
700113,17670528,2014-08-16T00:00:00.000Z,"I've been here for 15 days, in august 2014.
The apartment is as you can see in the photos: quite small but nice and clean.  From the balcony you have a nice view of the park. 
The apartment is in the city center, near to the subway stations and food shops.
Ilona is very kind: she invited me to a party with neighbours and she also washed my clothes for me.
Solution ok for 1-2 persons for short stays."
1128990,17641484,2014-08-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Anette has a nice apartment with a good location in the \"Sofo\" neighborhood of Stockholm. The area has great restaurants, with designer shops spread out in the neighboring blocks. It's pleasant, mostly quiet and 10 minutes from Gamlastan, the historical center. Anette was helpful with the check-in time and left us some basic provisions which were useful. The apartment has good light and accommodates 4 people (sharing one bathroom). The shortfalls for us were the lack of a washing machine (the laundry service outside was pricey), that it's a bit cluttered and, while in general it was fine, the flat needs a deep cleaning. Otherwise the flat is spacious and its located in a nice neighborhood of Stockholm."
299154,146879857,2017-04-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Daniel's place was just perfect for my stay. Daniel was warm and welcoming, and worked with my odd schedule for check-in. His recommendations were spot on. The location couldn't be better- two minute walk to subway, lots of cafes, shops, restaurants, and bars nearby. The apartment is charming, and the balcony space was perfect for morning coffee. I would love to stay here again on my next visit."
283446,2709526,2012-10-24T00:00:00.000Z,"The hosts made me feel right at home when I visited Stockholm. They came all the way to the port to pick me up when I got to Stockholm, and escorted me all the way to the airport when I had to leave. They let me use their bus/subway pass at a discounted price, and they cooked delicious and authentic Indian meals for me. The bed was super comfortable... (The first thing I did when I got to their home was take a nap.) They treated me like family, and they even planned out a schedule for me with a list of the places I should visit during my short stay in Stockholm. They also have a teenage daughter who is very friendly and knowledgeable of the top places to visit in Stockholm. I really enjoyed my stay at this place. Thank you so much!"
1248490,271704009,2018-06-02T00:00:00.000Z,"You will be pleased with the apartment, very high end.  Maria was awesome too!"

164448,5844864,2013-07-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia was a wonderful host,the direction given to us on how to get to her place from the airport was precise and just easy.I given her top credit to show us how easy to find her place.
She was expecting our arrival in the afternoon and treated us high tea while sharing her tips how to go about Stockholm.I would not hesitate to come again.Highly recommended .The location is good too,only 20mins walk to old town through busy street."
274876,526605643,2019-09-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Emma was an excellent host, very helpful and thoughtful. Lovely apartment ideal for our family of 5 adults.
Easy access by bus to central Stockholm, nice local bars and restaurants."

1307331,165773313,2017-07-02T00:00:00.000Z,"We are very happy to stay at Marcus's home. Close to the metro and close to  the center of Stockholm. Quiet and nice  place to stay in a group of friends. Breakfast on the terrace, in the sun, evenings in the large living room. We had a riddle - who would guess how the shower in the upper bathroom would run? Simple ! But surprising solution! Just move the faucet right! The winner had priority in the bathroom. But it was not embarrassing, because the bathrooms are two. Marcus very accurately described everything, left instructions. Thank you very much, best regards! We recommend!"
608672,20957078,2014-10-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Chambre avec un petit coin cuisine, centrale  et très calme.
Karl est très sympathique et parle français. Ces quelques recommandations sur les lieux à visiter se sont toutes révélées excellentes."
763407,10463338,2014-02-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Wonderful stay! The appartment is perfect, it's so nice to rent a place which is clean, so comfortable and with a nice interior! Located in Odenplan and only few steps away to supermarket, restaurants and bus/metro station (3 stops only from Stureplan by bus or from T-Centralen by metro). 
Communication was perfect with Gabriella, she is well organized and careful, she gave us all information needed for our stay.
Don't hesitate, book here!"
164448,333410794,2018-10-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Li was an absolutely outstanding host, going above and beyond to help us and guide us in our travels, just world class service all around. The place was as advertised, clean, secure with all the amenities listed. Would recommend for anyone."
819676,514519445,2019-08-21T00:00:00.000Z,As a solo female traveler I felt completely comfortable. The apartment is exactly as pictured and super clean. Thanks again!
299154,102167833,2016-09-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Quartier : meilleur emplacement possible pour visiter la ville, quartier avec plein de bar et restaurant + tres tres calme. A 10 minutes à pied de Gamla Stan et proche pour tout le reste.
Acceuil : Comme convenu et à l'heure prevue.
Appartement, pas tres grand mais tellement bien situé !"
556363,265781943,2018-05-18T00:00:00.000Z,Lennard is a welcoming host easy to communicate. His apt is amazing and everything is close by. Top address in Stockholm.
1048260,444697691,2019-04-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Annika’s flat is as lovely as the description. It is well located, a few minutes from the green line (metro) bringing you a few stops away to the key attractions of Stockholm making it a great spot."
819676,80287053,2016-06-17T00:00:00.000Z,"This was a wonderfully located place to stay at. Very close to absolutely everything, and being a fan of walking I enjoyed this a lot. As I arrived pretty early in the morning they kept me posted if I could check in early (which to my luck I could) and also were super nice to offer the possibility of breakfast at 4 AM.

I do recommend it :)"
475409,1312065,2012-05-20T00:00:00.000Z,A really nice flat in a lovely place of Stockholm !
1170766,17960806,2014-08-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Annika's studio is great! Firstly,
it's well located, you can reach everything by foot and enjoy scenic routes. (Plus, just down the road is the best ice cream parlour in Stockholm!)

Secondly, the apartment itself has all you need for a couple of days and you won't need to turn on the light since the many windows allow it being naturally lit. Annika was there when I arrived and explained everything to me. She's got plenty of maps in the apartment and was happy to point out good places for swimming etc. 

I greatly enjoyed my stay and will try to stay at Annika's when I come back to Stockholm!"
1182616,59346853,2016-01-09T00:00:00.000Z,"It's very good house,clean,warm and comfortable. It's convenience,easy to the central station."

1124388,408696530,2019-02-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice apartment as described, on a small island just west of Gamla stan. Carl ist a great host and provided us with very helpful information on how to get there from the airport and on things to do in town. Thanks again, Carl, we'll surely bei back :) Sylke"
647314,58045446,2015-12-31T00:00:00.000Z,"My mom and I really enjoyed our short wintery stay in Stockholm at Malika's apartment. We didn't get to meet her, but Malika was always ready to answer any questions via email.  
We absolutely love what she did with the place; it's comfortable, very nicely decorated and homely. Furthermore, set in the vibrant Södermalm district of central Stockholm, the apartment is excellently located. Especially if you are looking for a place close to small, inviting boutiques, which focus on design and vintage, and good value places to eat that the locals themselves would frequent.
We will highly recommend it to our family & friends, and we are already looking forward to staying here again!"
819676,323901404,2018-09-16T00:00:00.000Z,Great location and great local tips from Andy. Excellent and easy communication.

I truly recommend his apartment and i hope that I will have a chance to stay in his apartment again in the future!"
1231897,46059873,2015-09-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Our time at Alex flat was our first airbnb experience and I have to stay, he set the bar pretty high for any future bookings.

Alex was the perfect host, we even went out together one night, which was pretty cool. He gave us some good tips how to get around in Stockholm and what to see.

As you might noticed, i'm no man of many (Website hidden by Airbnb) i'm going to make this as short as possible:

If we are going to visit Stockholm again, we would definitely stay at Alex's flat again."
1170766,20162676,2014-09-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Für uns war die Lage der Wohnung sehr günstig: nur 2 oder 3 Stationen mit T-Bana zum Zentrum, zu Fuß nach Gamla Stan 15 - 20 Minuten und Station Mariatorget nur 10 Minuten entfernt. In der Nähe von Mariatorget mehrere Restaurants / Konditoreien für den kleinen Hunger. Die Wohnung war sehr ruhig und für unsere Bedürfnisse gut ausgestattet. Aufstieg und Abstieg mit Gepäck über die Trepppe (kein Lift) wäre für uns \"golden agers\" schwierig gewesen, aber Annika ließ es sich nicht nehmen, die Koffer selbst zu tragen. Der freundliche Empfang und die Fürsorge während des Aufenthaltes waren vorbildlich."
819676,91434971,2016-08-05T00:00:00.000Z,"appartement très pratique. Pleins de petites attentions à l'arrivée: serviettes de toilettes fournies, bouilloire dans la chambre avec thé et café à disposition, un étage réservé dans le frigo avec de quoi faire un petit-déjeuner. Idéal pour une personne seule (chambre un peu petite). Vannie travaille à la maison et donc toujours présente ce qui est pratique en cas de question."
1212891,227528172,2018-01-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice place, close to public transport, convienient for a tourist visiting Stockholm. Maud was very helpful and flexible regards our arrival and departure time, very friendly and kind. The house is fully equipped and the cat is friendly and used to people. Excellent choice and definetely worth it."
763407,16818038,2014-08-03T00:00:00.000Z,"The Cozy flat rented by Gabriella is a lovely place which we enjoyed very much. 
When back in Stockholm we will choose it again."
1248490,10265434,2014-02-10T00:00:00.000Z,"We had an wonderful time in Maria's apartment. The flat was absolutely gorgeous and very clean and tidy, and Maria was the perfect host. We will definitely be returning soon!"

628555,205931293,2017-10-23T00:00:00.000Z,Beautiful home- cosy and good access to transport. Would stay here again for sure!
438129,33642268,2015-05-31T00:00:00.000Z,"Eva var en väldigt trevlig värd som var snäll och omtänksam. Boendet var trevligt också. 

Rummet var mycket litet, men tillräckligt stort för att göra studier med ett bra skrivbord och en bekväm stol. Något som bör tänkas på dock för andra resenärer som t.ex. behöver arbetsro är att barnen i huset ibland kan vara högljudda (även om de är jättesnälla). Rummet har heller inte några fönster (vilket ses på bilderna), vilket bör uppmärksammas för den som vill se dagsljus ofta. För min del fungerade det dock bra eftersom jag ändå kom hem under kvällen oftast när det var mörkt ute. Sängen var bekväm och man sov gott i rummet.

Huset ligger inom bra avstånd till tunnelbanan och billigare mataffärer nära Hagsätra centrum.

Boendet rekommenderas till den som vill ha ett boende inom fungerande pendlingsavstånd till Stockholm centrum, en trevlig värd och ett stort skrivbord för arbete (men med beaktande av att det finns barn i huset)."
723539,486845097,2019-07-13T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a perfect stay at Mathias‘ appartment. The location is fantastic, right in the middle of the lovely Östermalm neighbourhood. Many restaurants, bars and important sights are within walking distance (Gamla stan, Norrmalm, Djurgården, Strandvägen where many boat trips start). The appartment is tidy and you find there everything you need. It is perfect for a couple, a couple with kids or for 2-3 friends. Communication with Mathias was great. I highly recommend the spot!"
242188,413250633,2019-02-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Amazing place! Staying with Li was like staying with family. She is very kind, welcoming and friendly- with lots of local tips and info on what to see and how to get there. Li has a gorgeous and spacious home, close to transport, or walking distance to the food and music district and old town if you prefer to explore on foot. 

I had a great stay, would definitely recommend. I was the only guest when I stayed and had the top floor of the apartment to myself, with a bathroom, kettle and fridge and comfy sitting area full of light and plants and a big bathroom."
1271843,48752427,2015-09-28T00:00:00.000Z,"André and Johanna were perfect hosts. They're house was clean, beautiful and located in a very nice part of Stockholm. We recommend staying with them to anyone."

581243,47422767,2015-09-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin & Ladiya were very kind and gracious hosts. The room and apartment were exactly as photographed and described and the location is perfect! Edwin offered some great suggestions and went above and beyond when I had questions or needed some help. This apartment is in the lovely Ostermalm neighborhood, which is a really beautiful place where a lot of locals live. Plenty of shopping, grocery, and some great restaurants nearby, not to mention that central Stockholm and all of the tourist sites are an easy 15 minute walk away. The Karlaplan metro stop is literally just downstairs as well, which made getting to/from the central station a simple 5 minute train ride.  If you stay here, I'd also recommend checking out the local cafe/restaurant called Broms, which is just around the corner. Excellent food and drinks!

I had a wonderful time exploring Stockholm and Edwin's place was the perfect place to start and end my day. I would highly recommend staying here if you have the opportunity!"
1048668,70611383,2016-04-19T00:00:00.000Z,The host canceled this reservation 75 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

We did not meet Anna but she sent us in advance all the info about the appartment.

700113,16713173,2014-08-01T00:00:00.000Z,"I can highly recommend Ilonas appartement! 
It was cozy, clean and really close to the city center.
Ilona was a very nice host – you live pretty close to her but still have your own privacy.
The bed is a little small for two persons – so only sleep there together if you have a close relationship ;-)

Thanks a lot for your hospitality, Ilona!"
1048260,41836528,2015-08-09T00:00:00.000Z,Annika was extremely helpful and went the extra mile to make us feel welcome and comfortable with the area. She provided us with detailed instructions and tips so that we never felt lost when exploring the neighborhood. Her place is also lovely as pictured and conveniently located. I would definitely stay at her house again.
1144069,39278172,2015-07-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Jon was a great host.  He gave unusually good directions on how to find the apartment, then spent the time to show us everything we needed to know.  His sheet of recommended restaurants, grocery stores, etc. in the neighborhood was appreciated.  The apartment was very comfortable and well-equipped and the neighborhood appealing and very close to two subway stops."

Très bien placé dans Stockholm, on a beaucoup aimé. En plus on avait un petit balcon privatif où on prenait notre petit déjeuner, très agreable !
L'appartement a 3 chambres et les 3 étaient louées pendant notre sejour. Nous n'avons pas croisé Peter mais il nous avait mis les clefs à dispo. Très pratique."

Vi hilste på Jacob da vi kom. Han møtte oss ved t-banen og fulgte oss hjem. Vi kan absolutt anbefale et opphold hos han."

The neighborhood was nice, Lidia´s house very peaceful and good location and room was clean and comfortable. Lidia was very helpful with telling, where to find everything and where to go. I´d definitely recommend her place to anyone."
1137050,14428927,2014-06-19T00:00:00.000Z,"'Perfect' what else I can say about Gabriel's flat!
The place was perfect!
The neighbor was perfect!
The host was perfect!

The flat was super clean, comfy, and artsy-craftsy! Everything was well placed and prepared for guest. The bed was amazingly comfortable as well. 
The neighbor hood was perfectly great to chill out any time. So many restaurants, bars around the flat. 
Some kind of Bohemian attitude about the flat and neighbor creates a certain vibe to make yourself cool and artsy in some point. Hard to explain the exact detail of it. But if someone try to stay there, you will definitely feel it as I did.

Above all, Gabriel was the most perfect host for me! He was a very kind and attentive for me to stay safe ! All communications couldn't be better than any. He answered the questions very quickly and explained every detail that I ask for.
Thank you Gabriel for me to have a great memories about Stockholm!"

This is a quiet neighborhood and we can get rest at night well. I think the only one thing that bothered me a little bit was that if other people slammed the main door at the first floor, I could hear that."

Moa is hospitable and easy to communicate. We didn't have the pleasure to meet her,but she gave us some help with directions and tips on the city, also left us some coffee/tea and chocolate.
Thanks Moa for a wonderful stay. We would definitely recommend her apartment to anyone, and hope we'll be back!"

Flat for one or two guests. Clean. Carl careful owner."
1231897,67837682,2016-03-31T00:00:00.000Z,I had a very pleasant 1-week stay at Alex's apartment. He maintains it well and clean. The bed is especially comfortable. Alex is very helpful and accommodating. The apartment is just 5 mins walk to the t-bana station and another 15-20 mins to the center of stockholm. Very convenient and highly recommended.

581243,175184541,2017-07-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin's apartment is exactly as described—centrally located, close to public transport, and spotlessly clean. We drove to Stockholm by car, and Edwin was very kind to provide us with all the information needed to find his apartment and also parking. We expected parking to be difficult to come by in Stockholm, but there are plenty of cheap and safe street parking available close by. The neighbourhood is calm and quiet, and the apartment is located above a shopping mall where you get easily shop for groceries. It is located very close to a metro station, so if you are using public transport, it is not an issue at all.

I will definitely recommend this place to travellers to Stockholm! Not only is it a very economical choice, but it is located in a peaceful and calm neighbourhood, away from the hustle and bustle of the city, yet appreciably close (we walked to the city by foot, without any problems)."
757320,252124838,2018-04-09T00:00:00.000Z,malheureusement le wifi n'a jamais fonctionner sur 3 appareils différents Apple.   la lumière du jour est vraiment présente et les murs ne sont pas insonorisé.
819676,127315696,2017-01-17T00:00:00.000Z,"I've spent 4 days together with Andy & Vannie inside their apartment which is located near Slussen station, with plenty of cafes & restaurant nearby. If living like a local is something you'd like to experience then do not miss this opportunity. While parking could be an issue especially at night (which applies to the whole Stockholm city), you'd better be prepared if you are traveling with a car.

Living with Andy & Vannie is also a great fun. They showed me some hidden restaurants inside this community, even invited me to join their dinner the other night. They just made this city more charming!! Lovely hosts!"

Also a great place to relax when you get back with a nice sized kitchen, good local restaurants and cafes, and extremely quiet street outside.  Would definitely recommend"
1182616,487790421,2019-07-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Great for a quick stay in Stockholm. Flat is centrally located, short distance to public transport and shops/restaurants/etc. all around. Though we never met in person, the communication with Peter was very easy and friendly."
1304431,13180632,2014-05-21T00:00:00.000Z,"We really enjoyed our stay here. Madeleine was a great host - she responded to all our questions ahead of our stay and was there to meet us when we arrived and show us around.

The apartment itself is fantastic - very modern and well laid out, with plenty of space for us all (a family of four). It is only a few minutes from Langholmen and its small sandy beach, and about a 5-6 minute walk from Hornstull Metro, which makes getting into the centre of Stockholm very easy.

I'd definitely recommend staying here if you are thinking of coming to Stockholm. Takk!"
1182616,448400125,2019-05-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Location is really comfortable. To be honest, the rooms (bedroom, bathroom and kitchen) wasn't  so clean, but Peter was so nice that he took actions as soon as possible when I mentioned about it. The big problem was we didn't know that there were other guests in the same house. I think it should be noted on the explanation of Airbnb web site. Sometime they were very noisy and we didn't get enough sleep. This could be the trouble so I hope it get fixed."

Super Lage, in 2 Minuten ist man beim Bus und ist dann auch nach 2 Haltestellen schon mittendrin. Das Zimmer bzw. die Wohnung ist einwandfrei und hat einen tollen Charm, man muss sich gleich wohlfühlen :) Der Balkon ist traumhaft, leider war es bei uns nur ein bisschen kalt... Die liebe Malika gibt Tipps und hilft bei allen Fragen rund um den Urlaub.
Die zwei Katzen sind äußerst süßt und sehr zutraulich - Katzen muss man also mögen :)
Danke für den schönen Aufenthalt!! :)"

La casa è silenziosa, piccina ma ben organizzata per ricevere ospiti. Ci sono due gatti che gironzolano per la casa ma sono assolutamente una piacevole compagnia. In generale la casa è pulita e la cucina è a disposizione. Maud è stata il valore aggiunto perché fin da prima del nostro viaggio è stata sempre disponibile nel darci informazioni utili su tutto, ma sopratutto ci ha fatto sentire come se fossimo a casa nostra, sempre.  In generale torneremmo volentieri e mi sento di consigliare la sistemazione, per la gentilezza del proprietario e per l'incredibile comodità e vicinanza ai mezzi."

We loved nearly every aspect of staying here, except for one minor thing that was unexpected and uncontrollable. We came to visit Stockholm during an outrageous heatwave in the summer, and in order to cool the house down we had to open windows that didn’t have nets or screens, and as a result had to constantly chase bees and wasps out that would fly in. But in any other season, this would not have been a problem we think."
763407,60494374,2016-01-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Gabriella's flat was very nice, it looked even better than in the pictures. It was some back and forth with the booking in the week before our trip that led to some uncertainty, but when the booking was final we felt very welcome. We also liked the location very well, and can reccomend a stay at Gabriella."
1054406,74929305,2016-05-17T00:00:00.000Z,"The beautiful apartment and it's surroundings had a lot to do with how wonderful our stay in Stockholm was over Eurovision week 2016. And Tomas's and Madeline's kindness and helpfulness made us feel so welcom from the get go.

We decited to skip the puplic transport for traveling around and rented a car. That is a great way to travel around the Stockholm area (but be mindful that parking laws in Stockholm are quite confuzing and quite a jungle to go through). But what made our decision to go with a rental even better was that T and M gave us keys to their bicycles so we had the option to ride the bikes to town (real easy and so much fun in the Stockholm sun) and around the beautiful lake (so romantic and nice - and you can swim in it).

The apartment is wonderful - so much nicer than the pictures show"
581243,23434980,2014-12-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin was a very friendly host.
The room was very clean and cosy.

Looking forward to come again."

Edwin himself was extremely helpful and kind to make sure I had a good experience, which I did.  I would definitely use him again if I need a place to stay in Stockholm!"
283446,33418103,2015-05-27T00:00:00.000Z,Vidhi and her husband were very friendly and helpful. They gave us good recommendations on places to visit in Stockholm and we very much appreciated the home cooked meals. Their home is a little outside the main city (about 30 min by train) but the train station is 2 min away and trains are fairly frequent. We would recommend their place for future travelers.
700113,134400499,2017-02-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Ilona was the perfect host. She was great at communicating check-in and out info and her room was perfect for my short trip to Stockholm, I was really sad to leave. Would definitely recommend her place to anyone."

We really enjoyed the time spent there, visiting Stockholm, seeing and living some of the Swedish wonders, making a lot of extraordinary memories and experiencing incredible adventures. Maud took care of everything so we felt really comfortable in her cozy apartment and for that we are grateful and we thank her, because through optimism and a warm and joyful aura she made our stay really wonderful.

1182616,41678848,2015-08-08T00:00:00.000Z,"L'appartement est composé de trois chambres et une cuisine. Tout est régulièrement loué, ce qui fait qu'à notre arrivée, les poubelles n'étaient pas vidées, les lits non défaits, et il y avait dans la chambre 3 paires de draps usagés roulés en boule dans un coin... cela a donc été un peu décevant au premier abord.
Toutefois, l'arrivée a été très pratique, nous avons récupéré la clé facilement, et l'appartement est bien situé  (15 minutes à pied de Centralterminalem)."
916806,103780460,2016-09-24T00:00:00.000Z,"I had a lovely time in this wee apartment - which was exactly as described.  I specifically did not want to stay in the centre of Stockholm so the location was ideal. It was nice to come back to (and wake up to) a peaceful, scenic slice of Stockholm. The hosts were ever so helpful and the instructions / map they sent beforehand were detailed and informative. I would definitely love to come back!"
763407,4981880,2013-06-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Stunning flat in a great location only 5minutes to the train station and only a few stops to the town centre. The flat was clean, very comfortable as it had a large living room with kitchen which we enjoyed relaxing after a long day of site seeing,  2  double bedrooms for myself and friends to stay and a very cute balcony which was handy due to some of us being smokers. 
The flat is beautifully decorated and feel her pictures don't do the size of the place justice as it was a lot bigger than I was expecting. The place had wifi which defiantly came in handy plus fresh Linen and towels.  Gabriella was a very welcoming host and we would defiantly stay here again and highly recommend it to others. Thanks Gabriella :)"
700113,6823253,2013-08-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Illona's place is really lovely with a light and airy room, a balcony to soak up the sun with and a beautiful green space directly across the road to go for a walk in.  I would recommend staying here as it's within really easy access to the main shopping area and not far from the Old Town.  Hire a bike and enjoy!!   Illona's place also has a fridge and cooking facilities and is very private."
688947,12217247,2014-04-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Good location, nice area and easy to find from metro/bus. Good facilities. There’s a small store pretty close as well."
700113,37138824,2015-07-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Ilona is a very nice lady and an excellent host. Communication was perfect right from the start: the replies were fast and I received all the information I needed, concerning transport, shops opening hours, etc. She even bought the books I needed for my course, which I wouldn’t have been able to get in time and gave me a lift to City Terminalen on my way back. Fruit and nuts were awaiting me in the room, a very appreciated welcome!

The location is perfect: the studio faces a small park, great for taking a stroll or sitting and reading. An open-air swimming pool is also to be found in the park, just a few hundred meters from the apartment (for those summer days, yes it can get hot in Stockholm!). Walking on you’ll reach Haga Parken, a huge and wonderful park, fantastic for walking, jogging, cycling, taking a plunge in the “lake” or simply relaxing. Sport fans will also find many a gym very close to the apartment (Word Class, SATS, Friskis & Svettis, Pilates Studio, Crossfit). Folkuniversitet is a few blocks away, Techniska Högskola and Stockholm University within easy reach. The city center is 2-3 metro stops away or 20-30 minutes walking. Supermarkets and plenty of bars/restaurants are to be found in all the neighbouring streets.

The studio has everything you need and offers complete privacy. Ilona is there if there’s anything you need, though. She has a washing machine in her part of the apartment, not just in the basement, as many other apartment houses in Stockholm do, which gives greater freedom of use (no reservation lists, you just need to ask).

The only downside is a patchy internet. Alright if you just need it to check your email or the occasional social networking, a bit problematic if you rely on it for serious work or studying. The bed is a bit on the soft side.

All in all this is definitely an apartment I would recommend!"
1212891,260826513,2018-05-05T00:00:00.000Z,Maud's place is really clean and well maintained. The location is good and easy to access public transport. Maud is helpful and gives good suggestions before arrival. She shows her hospitality but still gives personal space to attend my own things. Enjoyed my stay at her place and would recommend definitely to others.

She provided detailed information about the apartment and recommendations for the area. (The rolls at Cinnamon are delicious!) She also had two city bike passes available for use and it was a great way to see the city! The apartment is small and the shower is not separate from the rest of the bathroom, but we know both of those things going in.  The apartment is also in a great location for running with easy access to a trail that runs all the way around Sodermalm. Overall we had a great stay!"

242188,440743320,2019-04-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Een fijne, nette kamer met mooi uitzicht, maar de gordijnen laten wel veel licht door. Denk daaraan, als je in de lente/zomer gaat. De badkamer is ruim en de douche is heel goed, meteen warm water. Dat het toilet niet apart is, is soms wat lastig, als er andere gasten zijn en je dus moet wachten. Maar Li zei me wel maximaal drie gasten tegelijk te ontvangen. 
In de woonkamer staan heel wat boeken en een tv-toestel, een waterkoker en een microgolfoven. Water, thee en koffie zijn beschikbaar. En ook servies en bestek. Ik mocht ook haar keuken gebruiken om te koken en af te wassen. 
Li antwoordde heel snel op mijn berichten, heeft me goed uitgelegd hoe ik van de luchthaven tot bij haar geraakte en stond me op te wachten. Ze kan je heel wat info geven over wat te zien en te doen in en rond Stockholm. Ze legt je ook uit hoe ergens te geraken met het openbaar vervoer en zo.  En daarnaast hebben we heel wat gezellige babbels gehad over vanalles en nog wat :-) (Ik studeer Zweeds en dat was dus ook een goede oefening voor mij.)"
1212891,18941319,2014-09-03T00:00:00.000Z,"A finales de agosto mi pareja y yo vuimos a Estocolmo de vacaciones durante 5 días. El piso es planta baja/primer piso y está a menos de 5 minutos del metro, a pocas paradas del centro. La zona es residencial con parques y un supermercado enorme cerca. La decoración del piso es de lo más romántica pero todo super utilitario. Si no os gustan los gatos no importa, los dos de Maud son muy educados, duermen todo el rato y no molestan para nada. Este es también el ambiente del piso: silencio y tranquilidad a cualquier hora, y no se oye nada de ruido de los vecinos, es casi como vivir aislado de la ciudad, me encantó! Maud nos recibió muy bien y nos contó todo lo necesario. Para no tener que ir preguntado todo el rato tiene una hoja con información del piso en la habitación, donde también está el wifi apuntado. Con respecto a internet no pude estar más contenta! Durante mi estancia tuve que trabajar con mi portátil durante 3 días y pude comprobar que la conexión es perfecta.

Cuando nos fuimos nos preguntó si creíamos que se podía cambiar algo del piso para mejorarlo y hacer la estancia de los huéspedes más agradable (por cierto, son solo 2 habitaciones de huéspedes, no os penseis que eso es un hotel concurrido ni nada por el estilo) y la verdad es que creo que no es posible mejorarlo más! A mi parecer, el sitio perfecto para vivir, trabajar y descansar después del turismo."
1166419,80322674,2016-06-17T00:00:00.000Z,"La estancia fue muy agradable, el barrio muy amigable. Durante los días que estuve allí usé un wi-fi que no era de Margit porque ella no tenía clara cuál era su contraseña... Espero que lo arregle pronto. Lo pasé sin ningún contratiempo."
819676,104027091,2016-09-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Very strategically located in the centre of Stockholm. Shops are just a few steps away from this accommodation. The old town is also just 5 mins away. I hardly even needed to take any public transportation to explore the city while I stayed at Andy's. 

Bedroom was very cozy and private. The bathroom was also very clean and modern."
1244657,276586940,2018-06-14T00:00:00.000Z,"I loved the location! I would totally repeat and recommend this place! The bedroom was great, good light and comfy bed. The communication was great, i was alone and it made my stay more familiar!. I didnt wanted to leave!.  A+++++!. Im super grateful."
755843,350422236,2018-11-19T00:00:00.000Z,"This is a great apartment for a stay in Stockholm. Conveniently located, within 10 minutes walking of a train station and close to buses. Having more than one bed was great but keep in mind that there is no door separating the bedroom and lounge room/ kitchen, just a curtain. So if you’re staying with someone who snores or is an early riser, bring ear plugs. There are still some stairs up to the apartment in addition to the lift. Getting the shower to work was a little tricky without some instructions. Maybe Pär usually explains this but unfortunately we couldn’t meet him to check in, and collected the key from a nearby store. 
Overall, a very big and convenient apartment. I would recommend."
242188,56332642,2015-12-12T00:00:00.000Z,I enjoyed staying at Lidia's appartment in Stockholm. I appreciated her giving me many infos and advices. It was very easy to visit the city as the appartment is located next to a metro station and city center is only at 15 min by foot. Highly recommand to stay there and visit the capital of Sweden!

The place itself was clean and very well-kept and was situation on a big road which was pretty and in a generally nice area not too far from the city centre. Definitely worth a stay here for sure!"

His and his wifes apartment is spacious, beautiful and extremely clean as the guest room is too and has a very comfy bed. The apartments location is perfect - you can reach most spots by foot or city bikes or public transport (stations are very close to the flat). We had the impression as if the host wasn't really living there with us, kitchen and bathroom could be used any time without any problems. I highly recommend this place and its generous host."
1212891,182781547,2017-08-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud è stata veramente cordiale e dolce, ci ha fatto sentire a casa e non abbiamo avuto alcun problema sia a muoverci verso il centro città sia ad ambientarci nella zona in cui abita. 
Se cercate un posto comodo, a modo e una piacevole compagnia, avete trovato il posto giusto. Attenti a non fare uscire Sammy dalla porta, è un birbantello ma dolce e coccolone!"
302496,125161501,2017-01-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Met ons gezin een heerlijke week gehad in het appartement van Sita. Goed bereikbaar, bushaltes voor de deur en ongeveer 10 minuten lopen naar de metro. 
Veel restaurants om de hoek waar je kunt ontbijten, lunchen en dinneren. Het appartement is goed uitgerust en ondanks aan een vrij drukke straat goed stil.
We vonden het jammer dat we weer naar huis moesten."
647314,157232642,2017-06-03T00:00:00.000Z,Great location and ver comfortable! Mallika was helpful and a great host. Would stay again.
299154,13079028,2014-05-19T00:00:00.000Z,"De flexibiliteit van Daniel is groot. Onze vlucht had vertraging waardoor onze aankomst erg laat was.  Dankzij de betrouwbaarheid van Daniel was de ontvangst vlekkeloos.  
Het appartement is volledig ingericht waarschijnlijk ook doordat Daniel zelf het appartement bewoont wanneer het niet verhuurt is. 
Qua locatie: perfect!  Midden in de relaxte Sodermalm, dichtbij metrostation Slussen en op loopafstand van Gamla Stan."

Driving-wise, it was easy to locate using (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps. Very lovely and scenic, what more with the snow during winter. Things were very clean and instructions were very clear so at no point did we feel lost or unsure or uneasy about anything. We enjoyed this very much!"
1182616,233567415,2018-02-10T00:00:00.000Z,"這個房間有家庭的感覺,適合2-6個人,而且有廚房,在昂貴的北歐是不能缺失,我也是每天在附近買材料回去煮,比起餐廳便宜得多了｡這裡的交通很方便,樓下就有地鐵站和巴士站,機場直接前來可以乘坐彩虹巴士,去各大景點都很便利,步行去市中心也只是三十分鐘,可以在飯後散步｡這裡是個住宅區,有很多生活用品都容易買到｡屋主peter為人很好,相當友善,也樂於解答我也疑問和困難,也對我的行程作出建議｡"
301680,160716857,2017-06-15T00:00:00.000Z,"I stayed at Anitta's neighbour  Hannela's place. It was a very cozy and clean studio apartment  with all the amenities promised. I stayed here for about ten days. The host was very friendly, helpful and easy to communicate with. Had good breakfast in the mornings. The place is near to public transport. I would prefer to stay here the next time I visit Stockholm."

453692,2353640,2012-09-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Renting an apartment from Lovisa was super easy! She had the keys ready for us when we got in, and the whole place was clean. It was in a great location for what we wanted, and totally affordable for such an expensive city as Stockholm. I would definitely recommend her place to others travelling there."
1151217,29262979,2015-04-06T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a wonderful time staying at Anna's place. Unbelievable, but it is even prettier then on the pictures and a great place to explore the city from. Anna and her husband were very kind, helpful and quick in their responses to our questions. I would recommend this place anytime!!"
1271843,253083164,2018-04-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Andre is a fabulous host with a beautiful home. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The best part of our experience was getting to know Andre who is exceptionally kind, friendly, and caring. His home is immaculate, spacious, and very comfortable with very nice furniture and lots of happy plants in the windows. The location is very peaceful and also centrally located in the heart of Sodermalm. I highly recommend staying with him!"
916806,214526173,2017-11-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Logement non loin des transports en commun, comptez 20 minutes de métro pour regagner la capitale. 15 minutes de marche entre l'appartement et la station de métro, sinon vous pouvez prendre le bus (2 stations). Situé dans un coin calme, on aperçoit la nature suédoise au loin. L'appartement est propre et confortable. Chauffé et équipé. Seul le lit n'est pas très ferme."

274876,5747282,2013-07-15T00:00:00.000Z,Emma's apartment is very cosy and comfortable. It has a nice little balcony for sunny summer days. Plus it is situated in Södermalm in the reach of some nice places to go to.

608672,34931925,2015-06-14T00:00:00.000Z,"After problems dropping off the hire car it was a relief to be able to walk from the centre of the city to Karl's apartment - the directions he had sent us were spot on.
Karl welcomed us and showed us into the flat, which is next door to his own and proceeded to give us some useful tips about Stockholm in the general and the local area in particular. There is a host of eating and drinking establishments close to the flat and the T-Bana (metro) station was about 2 minutes walk away. Its an ideal location from which to explore the city.
The flat itself is comfortable and remarkable ingenuity has been shown in fitting a shower and kitchen space into the confines of an historic building!"
1182616,5154956,2013-06-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Peter is a really friendly guy and I had a great stay at his place in Stockholm. He's been very responsive (usually within some minutes) as i booked very short notice, everything was clean and organized. And the location of the room is just perfect!"

1117037,514441012,2019-08-21T00:00:00.000Z,Lovely place and had everything you desired.
866768,295463396,2018-07-23T00:00:00.000Z,The host canceled this reservation 16 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
164448,2346974,2012-09-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia is a great host, who makes you feel very welcome. She has lots of information about Stockholm and (it seems) every other place you may visit after.
The rooms are very nice and clean. Metro and train stations are close. Lidia's breakfast is much recommended. A great place to stay!"
347192,74895283,2016-05-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Tilda made sure we had easy access to the apartment key on arrival, left a welcome note and a bottle of prosecco and coffee for us which was a nice touch.

The apartment was in a good area, with many cafes, shops, bars etc. easily walkable or very short Uber rides away. A convenience store a few meters away was also very useful.

The actual apartment was as described, although the second bedroom is small and probably not large enough for a couple. There is also no wardrobe in the second room so we used a rail in the entrance hall which wasn't a problem.

Tilda was available on text and I asked her a couple of questions, to which I received an almost immediate response.

All in all, a good stay for the price paid. I'd recommend it!"
1153177,48084753,2015-09-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Terry was a wonderful host and the apartment was very nice and clean.

1153177,53757406,2015-11-12T00:00:00.000Z,Terry was waiting for us when we arrived in the cab - he couldn't have been more welcoming and helped us with directions...The space is very accurate ad there are many nice home touches such as candles lit when we arrives and a light lunch prepared in advance.
757320,5068713,2013-06-10T00:00:00.000Z,"I do not really have any complaints towards Barb. She is a very nice person, and am glad she was kind enough to host me. The main positives are comfortable bed, lift, bathroom close by, good wifi, and cheapest place i found which was close enough to the the city centre. Also has a metro stop close by. Be aware that the bathroom is shared not private, and the room has blinds which do not block the scandinavian 3am sunshine but no issues there. So no complaints really, just make sure your stay dates do not coincide with the stay of a loud-snoring relative hahaha! just kidding. Btw - very safe area! The garden in the image is a block away though."
299154,74362613,2016-05-15T00:00:00.000Z,"It's a great area surrounded by a nice bakery, good craft beer places, and cute design shops. Daniel helped us out by letting us leave our bags, made sure the place was super clean and he was easy to deal with. His studio apartment had everything we needed. Was cosy for two couples, but comfortable for a short stay. I'd love to stay there again!"

Apartment as describe, very clean and plenty of room. Location is excellent, only few minutes walk from the metro, and using metro you can get everywhere in the Stockholm. Only 10 minutes ride to the city center if not less. There is 3 different metro's you can take to get to city center.Apartment located near few supermarkets. One is 3 minutes by the metro station, and there is a bigger one around 4-5 minutes walk in opposite direction. Plenty of cafes and restaurants within walking distance. On the last day we seen a bunny running around outside, right by our window. Would reccommend Maud's apartment. Excellent Host!"

The apartment itself is lovely; full of light & art and absolutely fantastic to come home to. Lina was a great host, key pickup was easy & she left us some great suggestions for neighborhood shops & restaurants. (Amazing bakery recommended by Lina is only 3 short blocks away!)"
954832,295851777,2018-07-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Mikael was quick to respond, waited outside the apartment building for us to arrive late at night, gave us a good explanation on the apartment, the area & Stockholm in general. We appreciated him booking us a slot to use the building’s laundry facilities. The scrupulously clean, uncluttered apartment was well set out with everything we needed for our stay with good supermarkets, shops & metro station close by. There was some road noise which we could not hear when the windows were closed. Mikael thoughtfully provided a pedestal fan as Stockholm experiencing very warm weather. Honestly the best Airbnb we’ve stayed in & can’t recommend highly enough for a couple looking for a studio apartment. Well deserves ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"

755843,162949489,2017-06-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice apartment in a quiet area. The bus stop is just 30 mt from the entrance and reaches the city center in 10 minutes. It takes 5-10 minutes to walk to subway and main stores, but a mini market open till midnight is located just in front of the house. The apartment is composed by a kitchen, a living room, a bedroom and 2 bathrooms (blind). A small terrace gives a view on the street and nearby lake (100 mt).
There is enough space for a family of 4 people, note that the children shall sleep on the couch. The apartment is a real one, so you will find all kind of sauces in the fridge, herbs & dressings. Large screen tv with hundreds of channels, excellent wi-fi.
Pär gave us helpful tips for the public transportation and left the brochures for almost all Stockholm main attractions.

302496,83572664,2016-07-03T00:00:00.000Z,We had a lovely stay at Seta's place. The apartment is large and located in a great neighborhood. Seta left us some recommendations for restaurants in the area and we tried a few-- they were great. The apartment is also located near public transportation and is close enough to the downtown area that you could walk. Seta was also very accommodating when we needed an extra bed for an extra guest. I would definitely recommend staying at Seta's place.

Perfectly situated in order to explore either Söder and the rest of the city.

Restaurants, shops and subway are just a few steps away.

The flat is on the 5th floor, but has an elevator, so even with luggage, it's no problem.

We didn't meet Cecilia personally, but the conversation was really good and the check in and out perfectly organised.

So it's a really nice place to stay which we can definitely recommend."

We have appreciated that he stays so discrete, we really felt that we were at home. The apartment is just in an excellent area, the subway is not far, so it is very easy to visit the city. You will be in the most trendy area with a lot of coffees and shops. 
The flat was clean and exactly what we need, it looks like in the pictures. We have appreciated the neutral decoration.

581243,5376030,2013-06-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin was a courteous and friendly host always smiling and happy. The directions to find his apartment were very clear. A nice room in a quiet building in a lovely area of Stockholm, close to shops, metro and buses and within walking distance of the city centre. The Tallink ferry terminal is just one metro stop away. Edwin suggested  a local restaurant that was so good we went there twice.  We do recommend you stay with Edwin when in Stockholm."

757320,16429487,2014-07-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Barb was a very welcoming, pleasant and helpful hostess. Stockholm was the last stop of our trip through Sweden and as we travelled by car we had a challenge to park the car for 3 days without a fee because all parking places has to be paid in the city. Fortunately Barb was so kind and helpful and organised for us a parking place from a neighbour in the building. Thanks again!! Her apartment and the bedroom is clean and tidy with comfortable beds and we could also use her kitchen with our own space inside the fridge. The bathroom is opposite the bedroom. Her apartment is perfect located as it is close to the Metro station which is reachable by a 5 minutes walk. Alternatively you could also walk to Gamla Stan or the city centre to discover Stockholm.

My daughter and me we would definitely stay again in Barb's apartment."

She gave me a lot of useful information about Stockholm, what to see and what to, when to go and how to get there. And she prepares an excellent breakfast !  I loved our chats over breakfast and in the evening, it really added this little extra to my holiday. Recommended !"

It doesn't feel cluttered at all just well-curated and thoughtfully chosen. By the end of our stay, I wanted to sit down and ask Cecilia about her travels and interests. I love light and air and the two balconies - one of the kitchen and one of the dining area - were perfect. Everything is clean and well-organized. Communication with Cecilia was quick and easy. The flat is in a great location with tube stop, grocery stores, an excellent cafe, and a vegetarian restaurant steps away. It was also easy access to Slussen and Gamla Stan. Would love to come back!"

Jo as well as her mother was kind and open for help. From 6 days we stay Jo spent only 2 nights and other time we was alone. Flat is located 150 meters from Underground station and 100 meters from the bus connection to Arlanda airport.  
The flat is quite big, light and good equipped. Guest room is not large but has all necessary thidgs."
647314,154156890,2017-05-23T00:00:00.000Z,"We could not have asked for anything more regarding Mallika's apartment! The location is perfect: a short walk to Gamla Stan (10-15 minutes) but still far enough into the low-key and locals-dominated Södermalm that you avoid the tour groups and noise that occupy other parts of the city. Keyless entry into the building makes check in easy, and the apartment had more than enough layers of security to make us feel safe. 2 blocks from the Mariatorget stop, it is also easy to access other parts of the city by metro. (BTW, the bakery around the corner - Bageri Petrus - is amazing and definitely worth the visit... every day). Thanks again, Mallika, for the wonderful stay!"

She’s a fine host and was friendly, flexible with check in, and gave great tips on exploring the town.  Apartment is clean and quiet and communication was excellent."

1119738,468699429,2019-06-13T00:00:00.000Z,"I went to Stockholm for a work trip, and was forced to find an Airbnb as all hotels in Stockholm were fully booked. Thanks to Anna and her lovely house we had the best stay abroad we've had in years! We almost forgot we came there for work as it felt more like we were on a short holiday... The house is not very close to public transport and shops, but the neighbourhood is absolutely stunning and there is a lovely walk to the waterfront as well. Anna made us feel right at home and is very accommodating. Also, the house feels very cozy and having a separate living room for Airbnb guests is a great way to relax after a full day of work / vacationing. The only downsides to our stay were the very soft beds (our backs hurt a bit) and the small bathroom. Otherwise, 5/5!"
1244657,201900132,2017-10-09T00:00:00.000Z,A truly excellent experience. Great hosts. Awesome location. Try lunch at the place downstairs. Very good. Also Greasy Spoon nearby.
1041103,5087401,2013-06-11T00:00:00.000Z,"We really enjoyed our stay at Karoline's place. The apartment is spacious and the furniture gives it a really nice atmosphere. The location is pretty good with some small restaurants, a supermarket and the metro station just one block away. And even if you miss the last metro it shouldn't take much longer than a one hour walk from Gamla Stan.
When we entered the flat we were happily surprised by cookies, fruits and some stuff for breakfast which Karoline bought for us.
Check-In and Check-Out was very uncomplicated and Karoline was also very helpful when we had question concerning the flat or other things in Stockholm.
When I'm going to Stockholm again she will be my first person to contact."
581243,215012878,2017-11-27T00:00:00.000Z,Edwin was so great and accommodating. He showed great hospitality and was very flexible with check in and allowing us to drop our bags off early while we toured the city. He’s literally a few steps from the train which is only one stop from the city center. I would stay here again!

The room was as expected and shown on the photos, Peter is reliable and very helpful, so I can recommend this place if you want to spend some  cosy days in Stockholm City. We were mainly walking everywhere, but the metro is also close so getting arround smoothly will not be a problem at all. 

We really had a great time and enjoyed our stay at this apparment. Thank you Peter for being such a great host!! :)"
757320,49527667,2015-10-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Thanks to Barb's ultra comfy room in the trendiest area of the city, we've enjoyed Stockholm to the most! The bed is so comfortable that we had hard time getting up early. Every main sightseeing, shopping district, \"it\" restaurants are within few minutes walk (or simply downstairs!).

Carl was a fabulous host who not only emailed us detailed maps of the locations of the relevant bus stops to get there from Central, he also left us some food for breakfast.  Even more, after we left some belongings in the apartment, he met up with us again a few days later to return them! Would highly recommend :)"

1184553,87336938,2016-07-19T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a nice stay at anbritts location! Near to the old town (3minutes walk) and only 2 Metro stations from the famous Vasa Museum. 
Anbritt was really friendly! 
One thing you have to notice that it is really loud at Weekend Nights cause there are a few bars directly under the window. So sleeping with an open window was hard.
To sum up it was a really nice stay but we thougt it was a little bit overprized cause you only have one room and a bathroom and are not allowed to use the kitchen or the balcony."

He picked us up from the station even if it was very late, showed us all we need around the house, and also prepared the pizza N beers for us, which we really appreciated. 
The house is located in a nice community, where you can walk to a lake for jogging. The bus stop is also very close.

The configuration of the home was unusual but we all had our privacy and that added to the charm.
We cooked on the barbecue, washed clothes, and enjoyed the sunshine in the backyard.
I wish that our time had been longer than 3 days.
Our ages ranged from 61 to 85. We don’t like stairs. We kept our suitcases down stairs and we did not consider that an inconvenience, with the bedrooms being upstairs."

Flat has a wet room set-up which may be a little problematic for some (was quite tricky not to inadvertently flood the bathroom when showering!) but Karl is getting this fixed. Overall nice stay.

But Stockholm has great transportation, if you don't like walking get the \"Stockholm pass\" or whatever it is for transportation and entry to most museums. Room is good for two people. Peter is almost never home, I didn't meet him in 3 days, so it's almost like having a private home, unless there is someone in the other room."

The only thing missing is an internet connection, but to be honest I don't go to places to spend it inside on my computer, so it wasn't an issue for me, and the access to 4G pretty much everywhere (including the subways!) makes up for it.
Would highly recommend for any trips and would definitely stay again!"

It's quiet and lovely, and the location is AMAZING--the very heart of Sodermalm. There's a place two shorts blocks away where you can rent a bike very cheaply and easily (it's the best bike share system I've used in all my travels!), and you're off exploring one of the world's most beautiful cities!"

A perfectly equipped kitchen would've made a gourmet chef happy and the well kept garden offered different seating furniture. The striking distance to the lake made vespertine walks at the shore to an unforgettable experience. We hope that we can be your guests again in the future.\""

Andy and Vannie´s place is awesome! I give them 5 stars because:
a) Super clean place.
b) Privacy + own shower room. 
c) Outstanding location + safety. 
d) Kind, helpful and respectful hosts.
e) Close to public transportación + bars + restaurants + view. 
f) If you are a solo traveler, like I was this time, then do not hesitate about booking with Andy and Vannie, you won´t regret it. The penthouse is better than a hotel, and you will feel at home, while you are away from your own.
If I get to go back to Sweden, I will look for this place again, no doubts!

The room looks just like the pictures and was - like the rest of the appartment - very clean. It had a big build-in wardrobe and closet, so lots of space to store my cloths. I found the plastic box very convenient to store my hygiene products and carry them to the shower.

Lotta provided me a area in the fridge, where I could leave my food. The Wifi is very fast and absolutely stable. Several bus and subway stations are just around the corner - the location couldn't be any better. I highly recommend this room - especially when you prefer privacy and quitness."

It's insanely easy to find, right next to the commuter train station, which you can reach directly from Arlanda. She also sent me perfectly clear directions. Upon arrival, she offered me green tea and gingerbread cookies and we sat with the map of Stockholm so she could explain the must-sees. It was so sweet. Highly recommend!"

I stayed two days with my boyfriend and we think that the quality of the apartment (the room, the bathroom and the rest of the apartment) was similar to a good hotel but with the proximity of the host and nice cats ;) For the kitchen we had a special shelf in the fridge and in a piece of furniture and it was very pleasant.

608672,40686796,2015-08-01T00:00:00.000Z,"As many have discovered before me, this is a great place to stay -- good bed, clean, compact, wi-fi and TV, perfectly located in the heart of the city.  To the previous comments, I would add my particular appreciation for the approach to this apartment dating back to 1884 -- either via open cage elevator, or via stone stairs that curve gracefully around it, lighted by windows from an interior courtyard.  The separate entrance from the hallway, shielded by both inner and outer doors, makes me guess this space was once servants' quarters.  The building is located one block from August Strindberg's last residence, and a stay here is like stepping onto the set of one of his plays, or Ibsen's, or Ingmar Bergman's \"Fanny and Alexander.\"  How many times can you do that?"
438129,450768000,2019-05-10T00:00:00.000Z,"The house is well located near by the green line 30 min from T-centralen. The center of Hagsätra has two supermarkets and some shops like a coffee house and a restaurant. 
The room is really small with no windows but the family makes you feel like home.
I just moved to Sweden and Ea and her husband has helped me to get start it here. They’d gave me a warm welcome to their house and are always willing to help me with any question I have."

This was a tremendous help given we arrived late.  The home is a bit far form Stockholm, but the train connection is excellent and quick.  I definitely recommend getting a train pass.

There was a lot of construction in the area at the time of our stay, but this is of course temporary.  

Thanks again for your hospitality."
581243,407949020,2019-02-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin's unit is much better than it looks from the photo. Although it is a shared toilet, the house is only shared between you and Edwin. There is lots of space and privacy. The house is very clean and modern. The location is also very safe and convenient as it is just above a shopping mall and beside a metro station. Will definitely recommend Edwin house."

Down the road also within minutes is the transportation and shopping hub while also nearby the other way is the local train going out to the airport which may also be reached via the bus 179 right outside the building!
The room itself is very cozy & light linked to a neat outdoor terrace.
Amenities in the kitchen, bathroom & living room is very modern, well working & adequate while however for persons not used to sharing a flat with 2 other space & privacy may be a bit crammed/limited at times while very friendly & open minded :)
Thank you for a great hosting Marcelo."

Karl non ha tradito le aspettative e si è dimostrato molto gentile e disponibile. Siamo arrivati a Stoccolma verso mezzanotte e mezza, da T Central basta percorrere 10 minuti a piedi Drottningattan, la via pedonale dello shopping, e si arriva all'appartamento. Karl ci ha accolti mostrandoci l'appartamento e ci ha consigliato cosa vedere a Stoccolma.
Sapevamo che a Stoccolma gli spazi abitativi sono molto piccoli, ma daltronde l'alloggio serve per dormire e usare il bagno. Il letto è a una piazza e mezza abbondante, comodo. Il cucinino ha un fornello elettrico e un forno a microonde, adatto per prepararsi una colazione veloce (noi l'abbiamo usufruito solo per bere un the). A disposizione degli ospiti si trova caffè solubile, the, e vettovaglie per prima colazione.
Il bagno è pulito. Unica nota dolente: manca un vero e proprio piatto doccia (una volta lavati bisogna asciugare, il pavimento però rende l'operazione veloce e semplice). A disposizione degli ospiti la WI-FI.
Nel complesso possiamo dire che l'appartamento è perfetto per una breve vacanza e Karl è super disponibile ad aiutare gli ospiti per ogni loro richiesta.

Karl is very friendly and helpful. We arrived in Stockholm at half past midnight, from T Central just walk 10 minutes on Drottningattan street, one of main pedestrian shopping street.
Karl met us showing us the apartment. He tell us some information about Stockholm.
In Stockholm living spaces are very small. The bed is comfortable. The kitchen has an electric cooker and a microwave oven, suitable to prepare a quick breakfast (we benefited only to drink a cup of tea). Guests will find instant coffee, tea, and provisions for breakfast.
The bathroom is clean, but there isn't a shower box, so after shower you have to dry it. By the way this operation is fast and simple.
Free WI-FI is included.
The apartment is perfect for a short break and Karl is super helpful to assist guests with their every request."

Lack of wifi was a slight challenge but laptop internet USB is kindly provided. 
The apartment is very bright which is beautiful during the day but I did wake up at 5.30am every morning - so great for early birds!"
974175,110017249,2016-10-23T00:00:00.000Z,The apartment was gorgeous and homely. Even nicer in real life. We enjoyed our stay and the apartment sonos system was great for getting ready. The only negative was the camera as it's not something we are used to in the UK. A (Hidden by Airbnb) search set our minds at rest though. All good. Great place. Great location. Sofie was on hand to help us our trip and kindly let us keep our bags there on sunhat afternoon. Thanks J&S x

The room was smaller than we were expecting but all we did there was sleep so the room did its job perfectly. If you need to cook something small, all the supplies are there as well. We would definitely stay with Karl again. He was helpful in recommending us a few places to eat and check out, as well as helping us with any laundry confusion. 
The location of our stay was very central, only a 15 minute walk from Central station, and close to all the shopping, along with ostermalm. Highly recommend!"

The second bed (on the floor) was very uncomfortable, infact my partner has suffered backache all the time. For these reasons, i'm sorry but I don't feel to recommend it."

Next corner there is nice park for kids, supermarket, restaurant, beach and tunnelbana station are near. Free parking for car. Big terraces to eat outside and enjoy the Swedish summer. The owner is flexible and nice. We got all the gears for the baby and found lots of toys to play. The house was a bit messy especially the kitchen. There was not much space to hang clothes or keep our things. In the bedroom there is lot of light because of the roof window. It was difficult to get sleep. Bed is very comfortable. After all  we stayed well and enjoyed our Holliday."

The apartment  was easy and no-nonsense. The bathroom and the kitchen are both small, but contain everything you'd expect. The balcony is perfect for a lazy breakfast overlooking the hip neighborhood, and the location! the location, is just fantastic."

1182616,26316598,2015-02-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Me senti realmente comoda en el piso y en la habitacion. El piso esta muy bien, con una cocina muy comoda donde cocinar y poder comer, y la habitacion estaba muy limpia, asi como el resto de la casa. 
La ubicacion es perfecta, en una zona tranquila pero rodeada de comercios y lugares donde comprar algo de comida y tomar algo, y es ideal para llegar desde Arlanda con autobus. El metro esta muy cerca pero es una buena zona para pasear hasta el Town Hall por el Norr Mälastrand.
Peter es un gran anfitrion, vino a saludarnos y por si necesitabamos alguna cosa. Y habia mapas y guias en la cocina para que el primer dia pudieramos hacernos una idea de la zona y la ciudad.
Realmente una perfecta opcion para alojarse en la ciudad, que por seguro, repetiria en una futura visita."
1182616,9153935,2013-12-09T00:00:00.000Z,"This was my first time really travelling on my own and took a friend's advice to use airbnb and save some money. I had an amazing experience for my first time using airbnb.

It was even better than a hotel. I got the feeling of actually living in Sweden, got to talk to a person from Sweden and had a very pleasant overall stay in an awesome area right in the city.

The place was clean and very Swedish! Peter the host was kind, understanding, considerate and very responsive.

I sure hope the next hosts are as good. If Peter remains the same then you'll have a great time!

One thing to note is that you will be sharing the place with others (three rooms total) but that wasn't an issue for me as my room was private and most of the time I was alone.

Highly recommended for your visit to amazing Sweden."

The room was spotlessly clean and so was the bathroom, and they invited me for deliciious Indian dinner. We chatted at the living room and I heard from them about their interesting experience of living in Sweden. Absolutely lovely couple with an upbeat, radiationg personalities. Bana called a taxi cab for me and got up with me at 4:30am to prepare sweet tea for me and wait with me for the cab downstairs. That was so kind of him.

Worth the price for Stockholm. Positive: Very modern and lately renovated; Mansour replies fast and is very helpful. Negative: Kitchen could be equipped better (e.g. cutting board, corkscrew); Image with panoramic view is misleading (you won´t see this from the apartment and only little of the lake from your terrace). However, I recommend the place to people not having very high requirements concerning cleanliness and cooking."

I particulary loved the design, it's very well decorated and so warm.
The apparment is near Odenplan subway station, so it's was so easy to go to the center of the city (in few minutes!) wich is very helpfull when you stay  few days!
Thanks David for your hospitality!

1250227,188665894,2017-08-30T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment was quite well located not far from the city centre though far enough to be quiet. 
Per was a good host and communicated well including accessing the apartment which was easy.

I just thought that I did not use a laundry and assume it was downstairs. The bed was very comfortable and the kitchen adequate for preparing breakfast which was the only meals I had there. All needs for one or a couple. Check out Rolf's Kok restaurant very good and only about one kilometre walk."
274876,39143032,2015-07-21T00:00:00.000Z,"We absolutely loved Emma's beautiful apartment in Sodermalm....we were left touring hints, travel books and maps, and helpful hints about obtaining necessary items in our neighborhood.  We were left coffee, fresh fruit and snacks and the beds were very comfortable, with plenty of towels to use.  It was a joy to come home after a long day of sightseeing.  We would DEFINITELY book this wonderful property again!"
1182616,108389536,2016-10-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice, clear, simple. Everything what you need. Thanks."
1182616,212766158,2017-11-19T00:00:00.000Z,Peters appartment is perfectly located and very flexible for check-in and out. There are also other guests in the other room but they were not really interacting with us so it always felt as it we had the appartment only on our own. Peter came by every day to check if everything is good do necessary cleaning and bring out the waste so everything was in a perfect condition. I would choose this place again if I come to visit Stockholm the next time.
1158893,513899495,2019-08-20T00:00:00.000Z,Very nice place. We enjoyed a lot.

Great hospitality, friendly and helpful couple. André offered us advice about places to go, dine or hangout so we had so much choice! They even provided a lovely breakfast.

819676,94500821,2016-08-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Andy and Vannie are so kind, easy-going, and welcoming! They weren't able to meet me at the apartment last minute, so they had a friend come down and check me in to the room; it was very painless and their friend was just as great. The bed was a bit uncomfortable for me (very firm), as it is only a futon/sofa bed, but worked just fine. The apartment is incredibly nice, with an even nicer private bath. Great location and so much to do on the island. Highly recommend! Cheers, guys."
647314,147324891,2017-04-26T00:00:00.000Z,I really enjoyed my stay at Mallika's place.  The room was very large and beautifully decorated which made for a comfortable stay.

The apartment itself is beautiful and we certainly felt a sense of \"place\": it reflects the Swedish sense of style. We had everything we needed and it proved a great jumping off point for our exploration of the city. There is very easy access to the great Stockholm public transportation network, but it is also easy to walk into the city centre. There are plenty of restaurants in the neighbourhood as well. All in all we would heartily recommend this apartment to others."
1182616,433930622,2019-04-07T00:00:00.000Z,"The location of this accommodation was perfect, just 2-4 subway stations to the central station. Peter was always helpful and kind. The room was enough for 2 persons provided it has a balcony, the only bad part was that the bathroom was not quite clean and the sink (which was also pretty dirty) and the shower was clogged and there was a bad smell generally in the bathroom."
1182616,30954403,2015-04-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Muy bien! Peter es muy amable y correcto. Está atento a dar la información que necesitemos para la estadía en su apartamento.

Highly recommended!"

An incredibly helpful and friendly host who will go out of his way to help you. The accommodation was convieniently located in stockholm with 5-15minutes to all the major landmarks depending on method of transport.  Room was comforting to unwind at the end of the night.  Will be spend Stockholm again with Mikael.

875505,519379446,2019-08-28T00:00:00.000Z,"While the place may seem bare, it is actually serene and and calm. There are no frills or fuss at all. A functional kitchen for nights in (it can get expensive eating out in Stockholm). A spacious bathroom, with a washer/dryer. An amazing view of the sunrise/sunset over the expansive city. The best part though... the prime location, surrounded by shopping centers, green parks for relaxing, metro stop within close distance, and countless of sightseeing areas to explore. If you are flying in from the airport, there's an express train taking you straight to Central Station - a 10 minute walk from the flat!

I'll shut up now. Just know you're getting a good deal with this lovely home."

The public transportation is wonderful- the T-Bahn station is only about 10 minutes walking from the apartment, and there is a bus stop right outside (all accessible with a SL transport card.) About 30 minute trip to get into the Stockholm city center. 
The apartment was lovely- accurate description, clean, and well-equipped. We were able to make ourselves feel right at home. The neighborhood is very cute, and there is a shopping center 10 minutes walking from the apartment. We were able to get all our groceries from the Co-op, the very nice supermarket nearby. 
I would recommend this apartment to any couple, especially anyone looking to be able to get away at the end of the day. It can be hectic to stay in some hotel in the city, but here you can just go back to Anna's and feel relaxed and at home. 
We had a very lovely stay and would love to stay in the apartment again anytime we are back in Stockholm. Thank you, Anna!"
647314,7267648,2013-09-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Thanks to Mallika (and her furry friends!) for the warm and friendly welcome for my first visit to Stockholm.

The flat is as lovely and welcoming as pictured and is in a brilliant location for easy walking access to all that Sodermalm and Gamla Stan offers in terms of shopping, museums, historical sights, eating (I highly recommend Bistro Sud around the corner!) and generally soaking up the culture....

A great introduction to Stockholm!"

Thanks!"
608672,334831580,2018-10-10T00:00:00.000Z,Karl’s place was perfect for our stay in Stockholm! Close enough to walk to everything but far enough away from any loud noise. It was clean and cozy and in a beautiful building! I definitely recommend it!

You feel very welcome and so I can totally definitely recommend it!"

It was perfect size for a family of 3, and could accommodate a family of 4 or 2 couples. It was very conveniently located to the metro and the commuter train. So really, only a 1 min walk to train and 5 min walk to metro. It was very safe and clean. It had so much light with all her windows! Very nice patio! She had a good size separate BR and well stocked kitchen. We cooked dinner almost every night. It has a wonderful choice of multiple grocery stores, bakeries, ATM machines close by, all within walking distance. Karin met us and spent a long time discussing sites to see, as well as recommendations for food and wine shopping. She was very accessible the whole time we were there! She responded quickly to our texts. 
This apartment made our stay in Stockholm very pleasant , and we would recommend it to anyone!
Thanks Karin!!"

Is is a climb up the stairs but if you are looking for a location in Gamla Stan for 2 people it could not be better: just off the busy commercial streets (nice and quiet in the apartment) but right in the center of things. Five minute walk to the metro station and to a couple of grocery stores. Majken and Emil went out of their way to help us get our bearings around the city, locate restaurants, etc.  I highly recommend this host."

Her apartment is located in a central location with easy access to T-bana (metro) stations. A couple of supermarkets located in the area. Close to the usual tourist spots in Stockholm, easy access on foot, or by public transport (if you're lazy). Bed was comfortable and her place was warm enough.

1117037,152224306,2017-05-15T00:00:00.000Z,Polina's place was fantastic for my short stay in Stockholm. It is literally around the corner from the train station which takes you directly to Stockholm in ~20 minutes or so. There is a nice grocery store just down the street and the kitchen was perfect to cook a few meals. The room is clean and nice with a lovely bed and the bathroom was also clean and pleasant. Polina stayed up very late to check me in which was much appreciated. Great stay at a great price!
647314,4979715,2013-06-05T00:00:00.000Z,"We were in town for the Stockholm Marathon. The location is simply perfectly located very close to a subway station. Easy to walk or cycle everywhere in the city if you feel like it. The apartment and the room you get is great, and Mallika helps you out with whatever you can think of. She's a good singer too, as she demonstrated in a live performance at one of the bars in Gamla Stan :-) She also helped us out when we had a minor medical problem on our flight to Stockholm.

In short, we had a great time. You should know though she has two cats, so if that bothers you, keep this in mind. It didn't bother us - we really didn't mind, nice animals!

Thanks again to Mallika for having us. Next time in Stockholm, we won't hesitate to come back!"
1054406,124959225,2017-01-03T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a fantastic stay! The apartment is amazing, modern, beautiful and comfortable. Would give 6 out of 5 stars if I could! Thomas is extremely friendly and helpful. Honestly; all in all, our stay was perfect. I would highly recommend staying there! The lake nearby is lovely and it's easy getting to the next bus stop and to the city.
Every time again! :)"

I was there only for a short while due to fact that i arrived late and left early. If i come back to Stockholm and need accommodation at this area I would go back!
647314,194160702,2017-09-16T00:00:00.000Z,We had some nice days in Mallika's lovely room. Thanks a lot!
164448,526017713,2019-09-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Li’s place is perfectly located - quiet and safe (even in the late evening/at night), but also very near to main streets of Södermalm, numerous underground/bus stops (only a few minutes away from the Old Town/Gamla Stan, or half an hour’s walk), lots of lovely cafés and restaurants as well. Li is a great, hospitable host, with excellent knowledge of the city and always happy to share tips and suggestions. In her apartment there are a few different rooms for guests, but it’s really nice and quiet at all times as everyone respects the common space. There is a pleasant sitting area for guests on a separate floor, with microwave, fridge, cutlery/cups etc. for guests. Generally, anything you might need is available - toiletries, hairdryers, ironing facilities etc. There is no full kitchen available, but we - and most guests probably - didn’t find it problematic as there is the microwave and lots of cheap places to get food/eat out around. The room we had was very warm (there’s a fan available too!), clean and decorated in a quaint, old-fashioned style with lots of books; plenty of storage space too. The place is very well maintained and we were well looked after - I would definitely recommend Li’s place as it is great value for money (especially location, location, location!)."
302496,180339103,2017-08-10T00:00:00.000Z,"We spent quite some time at Seta and Goran's place this summer with our two kids and we absolutely loved our stay. The apartment is spacious and bright. The area is vibrant, very accessible, conveniently located within the city and close to two of Stockholm's most popular parks. Seta was very accommodating to our special requests and communication was very easy. I would recommend staying at their place!"

368952,149341089,2017-05-03T00:00:00.000Z,The host canceled this reservation 22 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1255668,33441313,2015-05-28T00:00:00.000Z,"A very nice appartement in a good part of Stockholm, well suited for families. We immediately felt at home. 
The city center is easily reached by tram/metro or bus.
The area is quiet and green, there is a garden adjacent to one of the balconies. You can park you car on the street next to the garden, it's free.
(There is a 5 hour period per week on all streets in the neighbourhood in which you are not allowed to park. We didn't see the sign and got a parking ticket.) 
Highly recommended appartement!"

1212891,121117016,2016-12-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Although we were only in Stockholm for a few days, we felt right at home. Maud was such a welcoming host, and her apartment is spacious and clean. The location was just a 5 min walk from the closest metro station and a short train ride away from the city center. There is also a large grocery store nearby. Maud was easy to reach with questions and even provided us with a guide book and map in the room. Her cat Sammy is very sweet and made our stay even more enjoyable."
368952,7064477,2013-09-05T00:00:00.000Z,Madeleine is a wonderful host. She will put a ton of special attentions and efforts to make you feel welcomed & right at home. The guest house is perfectly cozy and the pictures don't do justice to this beautiful villa. A beyond amazing experience !
628555,56621238,2015-12-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Anna and her apartement were an eyecatcher for us on the airbnb website, and all expectations were more than fulfilled: the discription of our way from the airport to her apartement was that perfect that we didn´t loose a minute. Although she was not in Stockholm, we kept contact for the whole stay. Anna also informed us extensively about public transport, the district of the apartement showed us a nice contrast to the old town and inner city. We would like to wish all clients of airbnb to find hosts like Anna with such a lovely and cosy appartement. It is a nice and safe district near to the center. Everthing was perfect, thank you Anna!"
1212891,9101057,2013-12-07T00:00:00.000Z,Maud was a great host. They enjoyed our stay at her place. Thanks maud for all the help.
533880,9028367,2013-12-02T00:00:00.000Z,"We spent a weekend in Stockholm, it  was our first time in Sweden and it was great! We arrived on a Friday afternoon at Jarl's place thanks to his precise instructions and he was there to welcome us with his daughters. He showed us everything including the sauna (that he booked for us!). Then he gave us the keys and only came back on the Sunday morning. The apartment was really comfy and well equipped. We were 3 adults and we all had our own bed. The flat is very well located: quiet area, 2 metro stations within walking distance (Stadion and Karlaplan), a shopping center, several bus lines... A nice place where we would happily stay again and that we recommend!"
1244657,321848391,2018-09-11T00:00:00.000Z,"This was a terrific place to stay for my Stockholm explorations. Easy five minute walk to the old town, two minute walk to your metro stop, terrific views of the city from the nearby Monteliusvägen viewpoint, and more. 

Nic and Usha are lovely people: very helpful and friendly. Nic even made time to walk me to the metro stop the day I was leaving and help me get a ticket. 

The bed was very comfortable, and it was surprisingly quiet outside given their location. I was able to sleep with the windows open all night, which was quite nice.

I happily recommend this place to others, and will gladly stay here again."
819676,268493512,2018-05-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Location, hygiene...  Everything was perfect. Don't even think twice.

The studio was clean and comfortable, located in a really nice area with everything we need, easy access to subway and buses and with very nice walks in the neighborhood. We strongly recommend it for a perfect staying at this wonderful city."

We loved the location and cleanliness. Maud possesses a sympathetic nature. Many thanks for the medicine for the kid and for the useful tips. We have bought the same balls-lights Maud has at home. And now we have a little piece of Sweden here in Moscow! We recommended this apartment to anyone. Jenia, Pasha and little Alexandra."

There are a few little shops/bakery's on the same road and Madeline was kind enough to suggest a great traditional Swedish restaurant that was only a train ride away. 

Loved it!"
1096827,13668760,2014-06-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Anita's flat was absolutely wonderful. Not only was it extremely spacious and charming, but it was in a great neighborhood.  The flat is across the street from a wonderful bakery my sister and I frequented every morning for breakfast and it is also only a 5 minute walk to the metro stop.  Anita herself could not have been more sweet and helpful as she left us some food in her refrigerator and even lent us her bike. I would recommend this flat in an absolute heart beat!"

You can sit in the lounge as well. It's in a very good location, metro station is just 3mins walk. Lidia is a very good host, we arrived quite late in Stockholm, she waited us and gave us maps, directions and suggested places to visit. We recommend it."

Gleich um die Ecke liegt die U-Bahn-Haltestelle und nur ein paar Schritte weiter der Supermarkt. 

Wir können Mallikas Unterkunft nur weiterempfehlen!"

There is a coffee shop, pharmacy, and 7/11 really close by. Quick eateries as well. Peter is easy to communicate with and totally accommodating. He let me leave my bags in his hallway since I had a late flight which allowed me to enjoy Stockholm for an extra day!  Beautiful view from the apartment and super comfy bed. Peter is so kind to give towels as well! I am coming back to Stockholm in a few days and wish I could stay at his place again!"

When we arrived (later than we expected), Daniel was already in the flat ready to tell us all the tricks about the apartment. The apartment was tidy and with all comodities. It is small but functional, warm enough and the most important, in a perfect location with 2 minutes walk to Slussen and 5 minutes to Gamla Stan.

We did a lot of cooking in the kitchen, again, small but functional. Just arrived we went to the pizza place just one step far from the apartment! :) You can buy in the super markets close to Slussen or Coop 5 minutes walking.

The information in the web was more than enough to arrive easily to the apartment.

It made possible to enjoy our time in Stockholm to the maximum, I really recommend this apartment if you have the chance!"

283446,6209854,2013-08-03T00:00:00.000Z,"I stayed only a day and thanks to Vidhatri's advices and tips. I could enjoy the city (Stockholm) in the best conditions. 
I recommend her, she is an excellent guide and a great host."
242188,532094264,2019-09-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Li is an absolute delight. She makes everything so easy for you and that is invaluable. Cheerful and helpful, she guides you from the airport to her home, where she awaits you with a cup of tea and a trove of info about Stockholm. I would certainly recommend her to anyone wanting to visit."

904739,526597887,2019-09-09T00:00:00.000Z,Great place to live!!! Perfect to discover Stockholm.
608672,133558624,2017-02-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Karl's place was clean and very centrally located. We were within a 5 minute walk from the closest metro station with tons of shops, restaurants, and bakeries on the way. Karl was helpful and answered all of our questions. Great communication before check-in as well. The place is perfect for one person but can be a bit crowded for two. The shower and the toilet are not separated so guests need to clean up the water after a shower or the bathroom will be wet. It wasn't an issue, just took us a while to get used to. We just needed a place to sleep and this was the perfect location."
283446,43309680,2015-08-18T00:00:00.000Z,The positive reviews are true. Five stars all the way.
1261445,487698138,2019-07-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Staying at Marie-Louise's apartment was excellent. The location is great, just by a park near Hornstull, and allowed us to access the metro easily.

The apartment itself was lovely and Marie-Louise's daughter was there to give us the key even though we arrived late in the evening. We were also left some snacks and basics in the fridge which was lovely to have on arrival.

The kitchen is well equipped, and the WiFi worked well.

The bathroom is very small but we didn't really find this to be a problem.

Our host was excellent and staying at this apartment only improved our holiday!"
541875,21886199,2014-10-26T00:00:00.000Z,"I had a very pleasant stay at Martins place. It was located very near the metro so Stockholm is easy reachable. The appartment was well described. Fresh towels, soap present. Martin received me from the metrostation and showed me around the neigbourhood."
1035775,9521951,2014-01-01T00:00:00.000Z,"We enjoyed to stay at Magnus flat. It was clean, close to the center and easy to get there (bus and metro). The flat was also bright which is great for Stockholm! We felt like at home.
Magnus is a great host! You can rely on him."
916806,120149679,2016-12-08T00:00:00.000Z,Simply super!
688947,81477784,2016-06-23T00:00:00.000Z,"The host, Alexandre, is wonderfull and helpful host. we were warmly welcomed and accomodated. The place is very quiet and peaceful. the apartments is  fully equipied with kitchen cutlery and all other stuff. just 5 min to subway station and after 15 min you are in Stockholms oldtown. we were very happy to meet Alexandre and visit Stockholm."
1124388,79378832,2016-06-12T00:00:00.000Z,"My one reservation would be the location -- it was not as central as we would've liked. Otherwise, Carl was a wonderful host and was very proactive in making sure we knew how to get to the apartment, and to and from the downtown area. The place was exactly as pictured in the listing - clean and spacious!"
700113,280063703,2018-06-22T00:00:00.000Z,This is a great place to stay. I needed to go to the university ( Frescati) which can easily and quickly be reached from there by bus. Nice balcony... and room with view of park. Very friendly host.
581243,86345527,2016-07-16T00:00:00.000Z,"This is a comfortable place for a couple, exactly as described by the host. Edwin was very quick to answer every demand and flexible, and seemed to be a very nice person although we saw him very shortly. Everything was well organized. The appartment is located in the very center of Stockholm with a very easy acces to buses and subway, a supermarket open late at night at 2mn."
530454,532837062,2019-09-20T00:00:00.000Z,very fun tour! Welly is great story teller and friendly tour guide. The location of the tour had phenomenal view! Very unique experience tour!
1144069,11816886,2014-04-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Very nice place, perfect location. Our stay at Jon's apartment was part of a great introduction into the Stockholm way of life. We highly recommend this place. Thank you"
647314,5062776,2013-06-10T00:00:00.000Z,"The room description was correct and the room is nice and spacious. In a good location also. The host slept in the living room which made it a little uncomfortable for us to use the kitchen (had to walk through the lounge, while she was sleeping). Don't go here if you don't like cats. Unfortunately, the host left unclear instructions on how to obtain the keys. She knew our time of arrival (1am) but didn't keep an eye on her phone, so when I called several times to ask for the key location, I got no answer, resulting in us having to book a night in a nearby hotel. Communication was a big issue with the host. Trying to communicate about getting one night's fee back because we couldn't find the keys was impossible. She simply choose to ignore me, which is very disappointing. I didn't even get a reply to acknowledge that she had received my emails (regardless of whether she was or wasn't willing to pay me back). Just nothing. Therefore, I would not recommend staying with this host."
819676,160435121,2017-06-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Andy and Vannie were great hosts! There home is just as advertised and they were very warm, accommodating, and helpful. The apartment was clean and we felt like we had a lot of privacy with our own bedroom and bathroom. The location was also excellent and very close to the main areas of Stockholm."
1212891,149591954,2017-05-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud was very warm and welcoming during my stay and communication was excellent. I really appreciated her quick responses and cheery disposition. The house rules may not suit everyone (there are quite a few rules in place to make sure Maud's cat doesn't get up to mischief or accidentally escape). Maud's sleeping arrangements are not so common in airbnb either - Maud screens off a section of the living room at night for her to sleep, however that worked fine and there wasn't a problem. Maud's kitchen is really well fit-out and she is very generous to set aside ample room in the fridge and cupboard for guests.
Maud's place is very organised and communication is excellent. I would definitely recommend!"
608672,49445892,2015-10-04T00:00:00.000Z,"The communication with Karl before my trip and upon arrival was great, he was very helpful and gave me a few very useful tips. He speaks very good Spanish!
The room/apartment was much better than I expected and was perfect for my intentions: have a place to crash at night. 
The shower is mini, but it is OK, although it is uncomfortable to drain the water after each shower. 
Everything else great: the bed, the kitchenette, the bathroom, there was even a TV! Perfectly located. 
Gracias Karl!"
1182616,425403886,2019-03-18T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment is correctly located (not is city center but it is known as from the start). Peter is very reactive and the check-in is easy.

On the other side, the apartment was really dirty during our stay (mid March 2019), especially the bathroom. Also, it was not clear from the start but Peter does not live in the apartment.

If clean in the future: good value for money and I would recommend.

If not clean: I would not recommend"
1231897,154840112,2017-05-26T00:00:00.000Z,Location really peaceful and with easy access to public transport. Alex was a great host and provided us with all the information that we needed
1035775,447737398,2019-05-04T00:00:00.000Z,The studio is cozy and clean. Magnus is always available for help!
974175,173215119,2017-07-23T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a fantastic stay at Sofie and Jesper’s. Their house really felt like our home for the time we spend there. It is elegant, comfortable and fully equipped. The apartment is located in a quiet neighbourhood with lots of stores and restaurants close by. Metro is a few minute’s walk away. Highly recommended, and we would love to come back someday!"
1149820,185336250,2017-08-21T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a great stay in Klara's apartment. It is exactly as it looks in the photos, quite small but beautifully furnished/decorated and has everything you need.

The area is quiet and peaceful, close to the water with some nice restaurants, shops and bars round the corner. You can walk to the centre in half an hour, or take the subway in ten minutes. 
There is also a great independent cinema nearby and a lovely park just minutes away. 

I'd recommend for anyone wanting a peaceful stay but close enough to all the action Stockholm brings"
954832,89093952,2016-07-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Mikael was a great host. We had a warm and informative conversation once we got to Stockholm and ended up taking many of his recommendations for the city. Place was very clean, organized, and well located."
700113,13343872,2014-05-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Everything went very well.
We found the apartment quite quickly, it was arranged just as on the picture, very cosy and sufficient for our needs.
We had a breakfast and dinner at the balcony each evening.  Shops, bars, cafes, restaurants were all within the walking distance.
Really good location - close to the city centre, but further from the noise of the central bars...
There is only one negative - if you leave you balcony door open during the night you must be a very good sleeper - might get noisy from cars and motorbikes passing around - otherwise close the door and you sleep in peace and quiet.
Kitchen is quite small, not really sufficient for cooking, but just enough for making breakfast and salad dinner.

Ilona is a very nice host, can only recommend.

Overall satisfaction - great -  my first airbnb experience was a very good one.

Thank you!"
299154,95533020,2016-08-20T00:00:00.000Z,Staying at Daniel's place is pretty much turn key and it is conveniently located just a short walk from the slussen train stop. Daniel is great communication and is very well organized. The apartment is in a great part of town. Right where you want to be if you visit Stockholm.
1115790,272853187,2018-06-04T00:00:00.000Z,Fatima was a terrific host and we enjoyed the appartment as well as its location.
916806,34791083,2015-06-12T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment was clean and the directions that we were given made finding the location relatively easy.  The view from the patio/yard was fabulous.
There are not many cooking utensils available (one pot, one pan) and the oven is really more of a microwave.
The bed and sofa-bed were very comfortable.
The neighbors are a bit noisy during the early evening, but the neighborhood gets very quiet in the later hours.
The distance to the grocery store and metro is short and easy to get to.  The ride on the metro to City Center takes a little bit of time."
299154,156340990,2017-05-30T00:00:00.000Z,"This is a small apartment in a great area of Stockholm, walking distance to Gamla Stan (and the ferry to the Vasa Museum at the entrance to Gamla Stan) and is situated among many good restaurants, parks and pubs.  It has a small balcony suspended over a street that is excellent for drinking coffee and people-watching.  There is a nice pub downstairs on the next corner.  Daniel lives in the apartment much of the time, knows the neighborhood well, helped us settle and explained a few things about the place (and gave us the key), then left but was always a quick communication away.  The beds were comfortable, and it was affordable compared to hotels.  Daniel's communication was excellent.  We would stay here again, without hesitation."

We pretty much had the place to ourselves which was great to have our own privacy. Alexandre kept in contact with us regulary and was a great host even though he wasnt there. thank you very much for the stay! :)"
1054406,81112966,2016-06-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Thomas instantly obliged us by picking us up in his car. 
Well that was enough for me to understand his hospitality. 
He clearly explained us nearby places on the way also helped us with bus and train routes. 
The place itself is cosy , clean , & comfortable. 
More so we we were amazed at the connectivity this place had to the city centre as it was not only convenient but also fast.

The apartment is as described, with a comfortable bed and good kitchen equipment. Since we travelled with a small baby it was very convenient with crib, baby chair and nursing table."
438129,323246493,2018-09-15T00:00:00.000Z,"My stay at Eva's place was really enjoyable!
During your stay at their home you will feel as a part of the family! Eva and Douglas are really sweet and easy to talk to but respect your privacy as well! 
The room, as mentioned, is quite small and without windows, close to the other rooms of the house. Nevertheless, after a few days of adjustment I found it cozy and I didn't mind. Keep in mind you are booking a room inside a family's home with children. Personally I found it interesting and hepled me to adjust the first days of my new 2-year stay in Sweden."
581243,22471772,2014-11-07T00:00:00.000Z,Edwin was a great host and Im so greatful for his patience with my very late arrivel. The room was perfect. A wonderful bed and a nice and clean room. The location is perfect. Thanks a lot Edwin!

The apartment is well located for any expeditions in and around Stockholm, the commuter train is nearby and central station only one stop away.

Her apartment is in a fantastic location and very well-equipped and her daughter Bianca was so helpful, giving us great advice about where to go and what to see. It was a bonus that Marie-Louise had left some delicious fruit and chips as a welcome gift."
1149820,18421472,2014-08-26T00:00:00.000Z,"I arrived too early to the flat, but I sent her an email and she came in earlier than we had agreed! She had sent me a document with \"usage instructions\" and local recommendations so it was easy to get started.

The apartment was really clean and... might I say it? even inspiring! It was an exercise on minimalism, but a successful one at that. The lift is also something to look at!

It is located in an area which has lots of \"local\" feeling, i.e. it's somewhere where real people live. The island in front (connected with a bridge!) makes for a very nice walk, and it's easy to get to the city centre alias \"tourist central\" in about 30 minutes (depends on how quick you walk). Klara also let me a bike card but I didn't get to use it."

Contact with Lennard was really good. He knows different nice cafés and he can tell you where to go. He is very flexible with timing of arriving and leaving the apartment, what makes everything more easier.

In short, Lennard has a really nice apartment with everything you need and more. He is a nice guy who wants to make sure your stay is as pleasant as possible."

She responded very quickly to my messages and was coordinated with me to arrive at the apartment early in the morning which was when I arrived from Chicago.  She was helpful with arranging for us to do laundry (which we did not end up doing, but nonetheless she arranged it for us), and letting us use her printer to print our plane tickets since she lives just downstairs.  The apartment was perfect for our stay in Stockholm; great view and bright and airy.  Recommend you stay here!"
