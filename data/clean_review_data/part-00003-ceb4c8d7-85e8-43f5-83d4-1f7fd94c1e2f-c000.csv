1151217,51018977,2015-10-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Very nice apartment. We felt a lot like home. Anna and her family made sure a friend would let us in and explain everything we should know. The cosy and warm apartment waited with a good bottle of red wine. Thanks for that Anna. We had a wonderful stay in Stockholm and this apartment made it even better. 
Thanks a lot Anna."

He cared about all the nuances of our arrival in the new year: he has prepared a list of Christmas events, how to get the best views of the fireworks, etc. He did not leave any question unanswered and was very responsive.

Apartments
Excellent apartments in 10 minutes from the metro station örnsberg. The apartment has everything necessary for four tourists - two shower rooms, a spacious living room with a massage chair (now I want to buy a home the same)), kitchen, dining room, two bedrooms. All rooms are clean with creative atmosphere.

Area
Excellent quiet area near the small forest. Going out in the evening to smoke, you can meet deer, hares, or a neighbor's cat. There is a good supermarket where we buy food near örnsberg station.

It’s a perfect choice for large company"
1271843,75420256,2016-05-21T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment was beautiful, just as pictured. Andre and Joanna were incredible thoughtful, generous, and kind hosts.  The bed is incredibly comfy.   The apartment is immacultately clean.  It's also ridiculously close to the metro, which is the ultimate in convenience, in a very nice neighborhood worth seeing in its own right.  The supermarket is right next to the metro, drugstore on the corner, restaurants all withing 1  block."
1307331,251542421,2018-04-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Marcus’ house was just perfect for a group of six people like us. It is very warmly welcoming, and the spaces are well organized, so it’s easy to feel like home. The house is not very central, but the metro station is easily reachable in five minutes and connects you quickly with the main attractions of the city; the neighborhood is also very nice, so we enjoyed going back here at the end of the day.
Marcus is also very reactive and helpful, we haven’t met but he answered fast in every situation, with lots of precious informations.
Everyone of us was satisfied and we had a wonderful experience in this house! 
Warmly recommended and thank you again Marcus and family!"
206221,54197778,2015-11-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Elisabeth was an outstanding host, she is an exuberant,kindhearted person who made us feel welcome and comfortable in her home. Her apartment in Sodermalm is very conveniently located and wonderfully quiet. Security is excellent and there's even a lift (elevator). Her apartment is quite spacious.  She offered us a lovely, healthy breakfast in a large kitchen, always nicely prepared and presented. The metro stop is a short walk, about 3 blocks away. We really enjoyed Sodermalm's restaurants, interesting old neighborhoods, great vintage shops, and of course the rest of Stockholm was delightful as well. Great little bakery called Tartan (Hornsgatan 32) about a 10 minute walk from Elisabeth's. Outstanding skateboard shop nearby, called Kalihula (I think). Really enjoyed Stockholm, 3 days wasn't nearly enough time."
1153177,265416416,2018-05-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Terry’s apartment was the perfect place for two couples to stay - we had ALL the comforts of home (kitchen equipment, linen, detergents - you name it!), convenient access to super public transport, and best of all, a host who kept in touch to ensure we were always comfortable and had everything we needed."
1212891,75503371,2016-05-21T00:00:00.000Z,Perfekt host! Maud is very friendly and warm. The apartment is very clean and calm. All you need for pleasure stay in Stockholm.
1170766,47262650,2015-09-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Very welcoming and friendly host. The App it's nice and clean. Subway just around the corner, but almost everything is within walking distance. I can highly recommend this App. Thanks Annika... C U next time...!"
1182616,25046475,2015-01-05T00:00:00.000Z,The location is great and the room is well prepared. Even though peter didn't meet us  in person but he gave excellent advice to visit the city. It was a nice stay.
438129,20290542,2014-09-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Eva is an excellent host, I had a good time during the time that I stayed there.

The room is small but it has all you need to rest and study. The house is clean, with big kitchen which you can use, and it is about 7 min walking from the metro station. Near there a commercial zone where you can find supermarkets and food stores.

I definitely recommend her."
1303522,45671700,2015-09-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Camilla's apartment is very nice with everything you would need for a great stay in stockholm. It has a well equipped kitchen and a comfortable living area. The apartment is very close to the metro station and bus stops to take you to the city centre. There is also a lovely park, near the water about a 3 minute walk away, and there are also supermarkets, bars and shops nearby. Camilla even met us at the bus stop to bring us to her apartment. I would recommend this apartment and would stay there again if I was back in Stockholm."
1212891,39752758,2015-07-26T00:00:00.000Z,Maud est une personne accueillante. La chambre est très bien. Maud vous fournira beaucoup de renseignements sur la ville de maniere très précise.
1189469,53722345,2015-11-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Although we did not meet the host, we received very prompt assistance and guidance through the Airbnb portal regarding the accommodation facilities and getting around Stockholm. The apartment was spacious even for 5 individuals and located at a very accessible area of Stockholm. Thank you Isabelle and would definitely recommend staying here!"
866768,277765041,2018-06-17T00:00:00.000Z,It has been a really nice experience being my first time in AirBnB. Sally was really kind and helpful. I will definitely recommend it.
1271843,362798185,2018-12-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Tremendous location right next door to the subway station, but without the noise. A very classic, spacious fifties or sixties type apartment with IKEA memory foam matresses and beddings, and a very responsive host that was out travelling while I visited, so I had the whole place to myself, which gave a cozy home away from home feeling."
1124388,310814002,2018-08-20T00:00:00.000Z,"I really enjoyed staying at Carl's place. The flat is stylish and clean,  with everything you need. It is connected to the centre of Stockholm by a direct bus that takes you there in roughly 15
minutes, and it is a 3 minutes walk 
to the bus stop. Super easy! There is a convenience store just across the building and a few affordable yet nice places to eat locally. Carl has been very helpful and always available, a great host."
755843,428487192,2019-03-25T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a very good stay in Par’s apartment.
This is a very nice apartment, well located to visit Stockholm."
581243,282473201,2018-06-27T00:00:00.000Z,"**ESP** Piso muy tranquilo, en un recinto cerrado y agradablemente ajardinado, equipado con lo necesario para pasar cómodamente unos días en la cuidad. Ubicación muy céntrica, lo que nos ayudó a descubrir la ciudad sin perder mucho tiempo en desplazamientos (tanto la estación de bicicletas “City Bikes” como el metro “Karlaplan” están a pocos pasos de la puerta del edificio –y a sólo 2 paradas/5 minutos en metro de la estación central de Estocolmo-). Además hay un supermercado, restaurantes y cafeterías en el centro comercial de la planta baja del edificio. Edwin fue un anfitrión muy simpático a la vez que muy discreto. Recomendaría sin lugar a duda este alojamiento. 
**FRA** Appartement très calme, bien équipé pour un court séjour à Stockholm et situé dans une résidence close et aménagée d’agréables jardins. Sa localisation est très bonne, ce qui nous permit de découvrir la ville sans perdre trop de temps en déplacements (la borne de vélos ”City Bikes » comme la bouche de métro ”Karlaplan” se trouvent à quelques mètres à peine de la porte de la résidence –et à seulement 2 stations/5mn de la gare principale T-Centralen). En outre, il y a un supermarché, des restaurants et cafés dans le centre commercial du rez-de-chaussée de la résidence. Edwin fut un hôte très sympathique et discret à la fois. Je recommande vivement cet appartement.
**ENG** Very quiet and well-equipped apartment in a gated community with nice gardens; ideal for a short stay at Stockholm. Its location is very good to discover the town: the “City Bikes” station and the “Karlaplan” subway station are only few steps ahead from the door of the residence. The “T-Centralen” railway station is only 2 stops/5 minutes away by subway. There is a supermarket, some restaurants and cafés in the shopping center of the ground floor of the apartment building. Edwin is a very friendly and discreet host at a time. I highly recommend this apartment."
581243,17237559,2014-08-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin is an excellent and very friendly host. His room was accurate to picture, clean and comfortable! An absolute delight to live at and highly recommended!"
1054406,277410560,2018-06-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Thomas and Madleine were very nice, curing and helpful hosts. The communication was uncomplicated, the answers very fast. The location of the apartment was very good. We could do everything with public transport. Parking spaces were available for the cars. We felt comfortable in this apartment."
514133,4864737,2013-05-29T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment was great. As described and as pictured. First about the apartment: Light, big livingroom, great cooking area, well stocked kitchen, good food preparation space and comfortable table to eat at. Mira left the refrigerator largely empty so plenty of room for stocking food. Refrigerator, stove, microwave, dishwasher. Internet worked well. Big screen TV worked with a limited set of stations. Bed in the bedroom is either a single or twin. Comfortable but not a bed for a couple. Was told the sofa in the living room can convert to a space that sleeps two.

About location. I couldn't have been in a better place. In the immediate neighborhood (a few blocks) are a park, an ICA supermarket (on Dalagatan), many restaurants (which I didn't try). Close enough to downtown to walk to Central terminal/City Hall area (about 1.5 kilometers), Old City, Palace and Cathedral about 2 km, port area about 3 km (2 miles), Vasa Museum on Djurgarden about 4km (2.4 miles). I walked to all and the walk, through residential and retail areas is pleasant. Stockholm is a great walking city. For those who don't want to walk, the public transportation is also great. I took the Flygbussan from Arlanda to St. Eriksplan and had a 5 minute walk to the apartment. There are 2 T stops within a 10 minute walk, St. Eriksplan and Odenplan. I took the T and bus to Drottningsholm Palace from St. Eriksplan in about 30 minutes. The 53 and 69 buses are a block away. Both go downtown and the 69 goes along the harbor street Strandvagen. Also took the east-west bus along Odengaten to get to a meeting.

Finally, the host. She left the apartment in great shape, a long note on the where things were and how to use the washing machine/dryer, dishwasher and trash. Made easy arrangements for me to pick up the key and leave it when I left at 5am for the airport. This was the first time I used Airbnb and my experience with both the apartment and the host was great. Would book it again if I was headed to Stockholm."
700113,150929292,2017-05-10T00:00:00.000Z,"It was great to stay at Inlona's place, as always."
242188,143747987,2017-04-13T00:00:00.000Z,What a lovely woman. Lidia was a great host. From the moment I landed in Sweden she advised me on the best places to visit and how to get about the city. The house was clean and tidy and Lidia offered herself to support in any way she could. I would highly recommend her apartment as it is very close to the city center but also very close to the bars and restaurants. A perfect place to be hosted.
299154,56863602,2015-12-19T00:00:00.000Z,Fin liten lägenhet med perfekt läge på Södermalm. T-bana och matbutik runt hörnet.
723539,188735277,2017-08-30T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment was clean and a good place to stay. We were three girls and had enough space. The location is good. You can walk to the main places and there is a supermarket and some restaurants around.
Mathias was friendly and there were no problems with the comunication. 
Highly recommended."
581243,15169603,2014-07-04T00:00:00.000Z,"This is a perfect place to live, work and travel in Stockholm as there is a big shopping centre under his estate and you may go any sightseeing places in a short time.

Also, Edwin provided sufficient information before my arrival. And he might tell you everything you need in Stockholm and his flat.

His flat is so clean and tidy that you may feel comfortable as your home.

Indeed, I have to stay at this flat in my next trip in Stockholm."
1137050,11116864,2014-03-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Gabriel gave us a warm welcome. The apartment is beautiful and a bit bohemic, conveniently situated in Sofo. Bedroom is quiet with good bed and balcony. Kitchen is good for breakfast, we did not try any serious cooking.  For a longer stay maybe TV would be nice to have. There is a busstop 59 just around the corner and ten minutes walk to tube. Great deli-restaurant around the corner, a bit expensive but just great! It was lovely to stay in Sofo. Gabriel was promt with communication via messages. We had a great trust that everything will go well and our expectations were oversucceed! Gabriel was flexible with check-in and out. We give a warm recommendation!"
581243,4158697,2013-04-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Wonderful host - exceptionally helpful with everything from the time when we booked to the time we returned home, maps and recommendations, the lot. Beautiful clean and tidy house!"
299154,10160910,2014-02-03T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a great time in Stockholm staying at Daniel`s apartment.

I strongly recommend to stay there!"
700113,19242494,2014-09-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Good Accomodation & nice area.

259025,16201060,2014-07-23T00:00:00.000Z,Our experience with Ali was wonderful. The house is situated in Rinkeby borough at about 10 metro stations from the Stockholm central station. The borough is very nice and quiet and prices much lower than in central Stockholm. The house is quite big and very clean. The room was impeccable and the beds confortable. Ali is very kind and we had a very good time with him. The day we arrived we couldn't eat because it was too late and restaurants had already closed so Ali peaked us in his car and drove us to eat something outside. He indicated us places to visit in Stockholm. His suggestions were very accurate. The optional breakfast was delicious and copious. We definitely recommend Ali for a stay in Stockholm and will choose him again the next time we go to Stockholm. Thanks a lot Ali!
541875,2339296,2012-09-18T00:00:00.000Z,Martin was an awesome host.  He met us at the train station and showed us how to get to the apartment.  He also showed us some of the best places to visit and marked them on the map for us.  Being vegan he was also able to show us a good place to have dinner.  The apartment was very quiet and in a nice part of town with easy access to the metro station.  Definitely a great stay!
1189469,10436073,2014-02-18T00:00:00.000Z,The apartment was absolutely wonderful to stay in - very clean and spacious. I highly recommend this apartment and hope to stay there next time I go to Stockholm.
688947,5718822,2013-07-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Alexandre was a wonderful host to us! He even hid a key for us so we could get into his flat while he was at work. He gave us space but also told us whats worth seeing in the city. He really made us feel at home. Thank you Alexandre!
Very nice was also the subway connection..."

647314,3242590,2013-01-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Mallika entrusted us with her wonderful apartment. We spent nearly a week in Stockholm over the new year and the apartment was an ideal base for our time in the city. Unfortunately we didn't get to meet Mallika but we did get to have a cup of tea with her friend who called by to check we had settled in ok. 

Aside from the apartment not getting as much natural light as we had hoped..due to the time of year it was, the warmth and unique style of the interior more than made up for this shortfall.

We would happily recommend this apartment to fellow airbnbers as a comfortable and cosy stay.

Will and Fiona"
1271843,463820294,2019-06-04T00:00:00.000Z,André's space is absolutely stunning and filled with everything you'd need to have a comfortable stay. My bed was super comfortable and I really enjoyed the spacious bathroom. The apartment is located 30 seconds away from a subway station which made it really easy to get around. André was away for most of my stay but he was super quick to response and available for any questions I might have. I'd definitely stay here again!
1263558,511333959,2019-08-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Nous avons séjourné dans l'appartement de Carl avec nos deux garçons pendant deux semaines. 
Stockholm est vraiment une ville très agréable, surtout avec des enfants. L'appartement de Carl est vraiment très bien décoré, bien équipé et situé dans un quartier familial proche du centre et de plusieurs parcs comportant des airs de jeux pour les enfants. A notre arrivée, l'appartement était très propre. 
Carl a pris le soin de nous fournir des instructions écrites et des vidéos pour l'utilisation des différents appareils.
Carl est vraiment un hôte très agréable : il est réactif, accueillant et soucieux que ses invités passent un agréable séjour (il s'assure que nous soyons bien arrivés et que tout fonctionne correctement). Carl n'a également pas hésité à prendre le temps de nous donner quelques idées de visites à faire en famille.  
Si nous séjournons de nouveau à Stockholm nous prendrons certainement le même appartement. Merci Carl ! Ophélie et Fabrice/
We stayed in Carl's apartment with our two boys for two weeks. 
Stockholm is really a very pleasant city, especially with children. Carl's apartment is really very well decorated, well equipped and located in a family neighbourhood close to the centre and several parks with playgrounds for children. When we arrived, the apartment was very clean. 
Carl took care to provide us with written instructions and videos for the use of the various devices.
Carl is really a very pleasant host: he is responsive, welcoming and concerned that his guests have a pleasant stay (he makes sure that we have arrived safely and that everything works properly). Carl also did not hesitate to take the time to give us some ideas for family visits.  
If we stay in Stockholm again we will certainly get the same apartment. Thank you Carl! Ophélie and Fabrice"
1153177,98327739,2016-08-30T00:00:00.000Z,Terry was a fantastic host and the apartment was everything we needed and more. He welcomed us with food and drinks when we arrived and took the time to help us coordinate ourselves in the city. I thoroughly recommend staying in.

278311,4252803,2013-04-22T00:00:00.000Z,Linnea was an excellent host - we stayed with her for 3 nights during the first part of our trip in Sweden. Both Linnea and her house mates were very friendly and welcoming and the house was a calm and wholesome place to be. Lake and woodland very close by as well as direct transport links to the buzzing city centre. Linnea kept in frequent contact prior to our trip which enabled us to find the house very easily. We'd definitely recommend her!

A few questions came up during my stay and Paolo was super helpful and responded very quickly. (Thanks, Paolo!) Sodermalm is the hip and happening part of Stockholm and this apartment is in the perfect location in the heart of Sodermalm. Everything you need is in walking distance including subway stop, supermarket, restaurants, cafes, bars, etc. The pictures posted are exactly what the place looks like. The kitchen is very modern and nice and well equipped and having a large, spacious bathroom with a full tub is a rare pleasure in Europe, in my experience."

The apartment has a lot of character, had lots of natural light and beautiful plants.  Annika was very helpful and gave us a list of recommendations of things to do in Stockholm and places to eat - all of which were great suggestions. The apartment is a short walk from the metro so was very convenient. It was a great place to stay and I would recommend it.  
Thanks for having us!"

Měli jsme malý problém při příjezdu s klíčema od bytu, neboť Alex byl ještě v práci a dle domluvy jsme se do bytu nedostali.

The three nights we stayed there: The other people were really dirty (specially in the bathroom), the other nights they arrive late at night laughing and making a lot of noise, they even rang the bell at 3am.
We paid a lot of money and we wanted to sleep at night to visit Stockholm early in the morning. 
Everything was really uncomfortable for us.
Peter was really nice when we sent him emails explaining the situation, and we know that he came to clean several times, but the bathroom was dirty as soon as the other family used it. 
I am sorry, but we don't recommend it, we would never go there again."

Three restaurants within a few blocks; the Magnolia, Tehran, and Tabbouleh.  Magnolia has a happy hour where you get a beer or a glass of wine with small open face sandwiches for 65 kroner!"

Ilona is such a wonderful lady and her apartment was very clean, also in a good location with easy access to public transportation.  Ilona set up a crib and toddler equipment for our young daughter.  She also left a stuffed animal for our daughter which was so thoughtful!  Ilona was flexible with our check in/out and was easy to communicate with.  She even let us leave our bags when we checked out and we came back to get them before our flight.  Highly recommend!"

His house is very cosy and comfortable and had everything we could possibly need. We even saw deer in the garden which my two young boys loved!

Thank you, Jacob for a wonderful stay. We would love to stay at yours again next time we visit Stockholm."
1137050,9355706,2013-12-23T00:00:00.000Z,"In few words, my stay at Gabriel's place was perfect. When it comes to the apt, it was spacious, homey, creative and unique. when it comes to Gabriel as a host, he was excellent. Helpful, friendly and a great communicator. I looked through tones of places on airbnb in Stockholm and Gabriel's really stood out. I would strongly recommend Gabriel's apt. to anyone who is looking for a special experience in Stockholm. Thank you Gabriel!"
170651,446360534,2019-05-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Marie's home is a lovely green space, ideally located with a bus stop outside and super market and metro 5 min walk away. Most of Stockholm is 30-50min away depending on your choice of transport.

We were lucky to have good weather and it was especially lovely to share a wine on the balcony after putting our baby to bed.

A slight issue with cat hair and some allergies is the only reason we couldn't give Marie a perfect 5."

875505,14195077,2014-06-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Electra is super chill,  very personable and has a sweet flat.
Everything you need is here including super fast fibre internet. Which is a god send for me. 

I'm business, so need certain amenities more than a tourist, and hotels have a habit of having super slow web, so it make a nice change to be able to watch some Netflix. Being able to clean my clothes (Washer and Dryer here), cook for myself and have a fridge is also a nice change.

The flat is also mega clean, the bed is nice and comfy (definite must), and she has an airbed, or pull out mattress for extra people.

And if you have any questions, Electra is willing to help out. 

Oh and the location is smack bang in the middle of it all. Been enjoying the short walk home from the local nightlife. And the T-Bana underground line is less than 5 minutes walk away, at which point all of Stockholm is at your fingertips.

And if you should miss the last tram home, well, you're never to far from Electra's flat it seems.

So I can't really say much more positive, I think I've covered it all, Electra and her flat are awesome, and how all on Airbnb should be. And good price too. (Search up the hotels in this area and you'll know what I mean)

:)"
819676,197900121,2017-09-27T00:00:00.000Z,"I thought this was the perfect place to stay for a solo traveler like myself. The room was cozy and I was in perfect proximity to Old Town. When I walked out of the building, there was so much beauty all around me. Andy was a very hospitable and flexible host; he met me earlier than check in time to make sure I got my keys and was in the building safely. The flat itself is large and beautiful. I had the perfect introduction to my first stay in Stockholm."
1212891,275526163,2018-06-11T00:00:00.000Z,"The place is easy to access by metro (and bus), with a direct line to the center, and is also about 5 minutes from a lovely water shore. The place feels quiet and peaceful, the area is very green (like the entire city actually!) , and there is even a small garden near the block where we had our coffee in the morning. The room itself is small but very cozy and had absolutely everything we needed in. Sammy's patience with strangers is incredible, and Maud had everything labeled and prepared for guests - from coffee to towels, there was no moment of feeling uneasy or not knowing what to do. Maud was extra patient and responsive and there to help with advice whenever we needed. A perfect stay!"

The apartment was very clean and matched our expectations however, we were a little bit disappointed to see that the panoramic view promised wasn't here. We thought we'll see the forest and river right through our window but thanks the weather that wasn't so bad we could enjoy it by walking outside on a few meters."

L'accès à la vieille ville est même possible à pieds en une vingtaine de minutes et le trajet est très agréable !
Lidia nous a accueillies avec des guides et de nombreuses informations sur la ville, ce qui nous a permis de découvrir des endroits dans lesquels nous n'avions pas prévu d'aller. Nous vous recommandons ses petits déjeuners qui permettent d'échanger avec Lidia sur nos pays respectifs.
Très enrichissant ! Nous reviendrons avec plaisir !"

The apartment was perfect for our group. Three good sized bedrooms, large living room to hang out in, and nice dining/kitchen area for meals. The two porches were great too, although a little cold when we visited. The apartment is in a quiet area, but an easy walk to restaurants/bars, the city center, and only minutes from the subway. I would definitely recommend the apartment for a group of friends or a family."

We stayed here as a group of five friends to attend a cycling event. Dany went out of the way to make the trip memorable. He even left out tools for our bikes

House is in a quite residential area which is easy enough to get to. It's about 10 mins walk to Tunnelbana and has parking if you are renting a car. 

The place is clean and very homely. Kitchen is well equipped which makes breakfast an easy job and then you are ready to have a fun day. 

We were arriving late at checkin and Dany had left enough stuff in kitchen sufficient for five people to have breakfast. 

Overall we had a nice stay."

954832,4472010,2013-05-07T00:00:00.000Z,"It was our first time in Stockholm and with airbnb and Mikael made us feel very welcome. He had lots of information to share with us about the city and things to see/do. He took good care of us during our stay, making sure we had everything we needed.
The studio in itself is clean, very bright and super comfy. There is plenty of space to feel at ease and everything you need. The small kitchen is perfect for breakfast or to dine in. The area is quiet.
Arriving from Arlanda airport with the bus, it is only a 10mn walk to the flat. There is a tube station right at the corner of the street that will take you to the city center in no time.

I strongly recommend Mikael's city studio to anyone, we had a lovely stay and Mikael was a great host !"

1182616,49052927,2015-09-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Das Zimmer und die Wohnung an sich waren sehr ordentlich und entsprachen der Beschreibung. Peter selbst war sehr freundlich und über die AirBnB Website oder per SMS erreichbar falls Fragen oder Probleme auftauchen sollten, dies war bei unserem Aufenthalt jedoch nicht der Fall.
Was noch anzumerken ist, ist dass Peter selbst nicht in der angebotenen Wohnung wohnt, alle 3 Räume der Wohnung sind an wechselnde Gäste vermietet. Hierdurch haben wir Peter recht selten angetroffen, was an dieser Stelle jedoch völlig neutral erwähnt sein soll. Auf Fragen, die ich im Vorfeld über die AirBnB Website gestellt habe hat er immer sehr schnell und freundlich geantwortet und war allgemein sehr hilfsbereit.
Bad und Küche waren ebenfalls stets sauber und gepflegt.
Der kleine Balkon war sehr schön, gerade wenn morgens die Sonne darauf schien.
Die Wohnung ist sehr zentral gelegen, wer gut zu Fuß ist kann sogar in die Innenstadt (Gamla Stan) laufen, dies haben wir an unserem ersten Tag getan, sonst jedoch lieber die 4/5 Haltestellen mit der Metro zurückgelegt, Bus und U-Bahn Haltestellen befinden sich nahe der Wohnung, ein Supermarkt ist ebenfalls nicht weit.

Allgemein war es ein sehr angenehmer Aufenthalt, ich würde Peter's Wohnung jederzeit weiterempfehlen.

It's in a great location, around 15-20 minutes from the center of town by train. There's a train station just around the corner, it's around a 5 min walk. There's also a very large supermarket at the train station. Marie was very generous and left fruit, chips and sweets out for us to enjoy. She also had fresh milk and juice ready in the fridge for us.
The apartment is very clean although be warned that the bathroom is small, very small. It's around the size of a toilet cubical, with a shower and sink in there. It works very well and is very efficient, it's a real Stockholm experience although quite different from a larger bathroom."

We were catching an evening ferry to Helsinki so Daniel allowed us a late check out. Awesome! We fell in love with Stockholm and would love to return--both to the city and Daniel's place.

Das Appartment ist klein aber vollkommen ausreichend für einen Städtetrip.

Carl ist freundliche und hilfsbereit. Wir wurden sogar an der Bushaltestelle abgeholt.
Einziges kleines Manko war, dass das Geschirr teilweise nicht zu 100% sauber war.
Alles in allem sehr empfehlenswert! Gerne wieder."

The apartment is perfect for 3 persons cause the second bed is quite small for 2 persons even thought you can sleep in the sofa in the living room. Otherwise we enjoyed our stay. We highly recommend it.

Sergej is a super friendly guy, he was always available and immensely helpful in those two weeks. Definitely recommend staying at his place."
164448,235572014,2018-02-17T00:00:00.000Z,Li is a nice and considerate host. The communication was smooth and so was the check-in. The place is convenient for guests with several public transportation hubs are just around the corner. I enjoyed my stay in Li's apartment in Stockholm and I would definitely recommend it to others.

274876,46860862,2015-09-14T00:00:00.000Z,"3 coworkers and I stayed at Emma's apt, and it was wonderful. She met us at the apt, and gave us recommendations. She was super welcoming and so kind. The apartment has plenty of space; didn't feel crammed with 4 of us. It was also clean, comfortable and super cute. The neighborhood is perfect; quiet, yet plenty of shops and restaurants within walking distance. Not touristy at all, which we were hoping to avoid. Favorite restaurants were Gossip, Greasy Spoon and Urban Deli. All in all, awesome experience and I would stay again in a heartbeat."
164448,94293426,2016-08-15T00:00:00.000Z,The apartment was very easy to find and in a great location. It was close to transport and lots of great cafes. Great spot!

We had a fantastic time, the place is exactly as described, in a lovely and safe area of town. Emma even had a cot and a highchair for us and in the yard of the building is a nice little area with some toys where the kids could play safely. The apartment is well equipped and there was plenty of space for all of us. We had our camper van with us and we could park it directly outside the building and parking fees were not too high given it was in a city. The bus stop was just about 100 metres down the road and a supermarket and Systembolaget in walking distance nearby, as well as various restaurants, bars and a lovely park with playground. We walked to most places during our stay, the location is great for exploring Stockholm."

Comfortable beds, great kitchen and dining area, two balconies for enjoying morning coffee and warm cardamon bread from the bakery which is a short walk away. Terry was a gracious host who met us off the metro to lead us to the apartment, had delicious snacks waiting and arranged for our taxi back to the airport. Loved it! Thank you!"

Maud a toujours le sourire et son chat Sammy est vraiment magnifique. 
L’appartement est à 5 min de la station de métro qui nous amène en plein centre, 3 lignes desservent la station donc un train toutes les 3 minutes. 1 supérette et 1 supermarché à côté de l’appartement, très pratique."

The apartment is about 10 minutes to  
Medborgarplatsen T-bana on Tjärhovsgatan and also to the Sodermalm waterfront.  

We really like the bed because of the fresh covers and linen and the mattress made for a good sleep. 

Now we are at a hotel because of work and we miss it!"

1158893,482916916,2019-07-07T00:00:00.000Z,We really enjoyed our stay at Dany's place. It was close to a train station that lead into the heart of the city. We had 10 people (6 adults and 4 kids) staying here and there was plenty of room. We loved having two showers and two sets of washers and dryers. Dany helped answer all of our questions and was open to giving us ideas on where to eat and what to visit. We would stay here again. Dany was an excellent host and we wished we had more time to explore Stockholm.
875505,357920289,2018-12-12T00:00:00.000Z,Freja is a very nice and well organized host. I really liked the flat which was nice and clean. I would absolutely choose to come back.
299154,299672610,2018-07-31T00:00:00.000Z,"Daniel’s place is a perfect cosy bolt hole for a city break in Stockholm. It is ideally located, right around the corner from a subway stop but within walking distance to many things in Stockholm- especially the old town. While the space is small, it has everything you need and the little balcony terrace was most appreciated. If I came back to Stockholm I was definitely stay here again, Daniel has thought of everything with lovely little touches everywhere - I would definitely recommend this Airbnb."

The place is conveniently located and I was able to reach most of the important spots on foot."
1182616,71049276,2016-04-23T00:00:00.000Z,"The stay at this apartment was okay. The positive was the Location (close to water and only 2 stations from the City) and the balcony. Also the room was okay. 
But we use Airbnb to get insiders about a City and stay with People, who live in this City. This is not given at Peters Apartment, because Peter himself does not live there. Other Airbnb guests also stay there. So it can be noisy. Also the bathroom was dirty and stinky. It felt more like a Hostel than an Airbnb Apartment. 
For a short trip ist was ok."
1170766,250826014,2018-04-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Ik ben 5 weken in Annika's appartement verbleven en het was een zeer goede ervaring. Het is een gezellige studio en voor mij echt een 'home away from home'. Ook ligt het appartement op de perfecte locatie om Stockholm te ontdekken. Annika is heel vriendelijk en gastvrij, ze reageerde snel op alle vragen die ik had en was altijd bereid om te helpen. Ik kan Annika's studio iedereen aanraden!"

The apartment is very clean and cozy and the cats are lovely. The location is excellent: the neighboorhood is great and the metrostation and supermarket are close. 

Furthermore, Maud is a very helping person. She gave us valuable information about the city, for example about using the citybike network, which we really recommend in combination with a SL card. 

We would love to visit Stockholm again some time.. and hope we could then book with Maud again:)!

Thanks a lot Maud!"

The practice itself fits to all level. I am a intermediate beginner :) and the day after I could feel the benefits of the lesson.
At the end we also had a little talk together with all other participants and Solveig gave also us a very nice travel guide with her best tips for Frankfurt! Thank you Solveig! It was fun!"

The bathroom and shower are also very nice, and it has laundry facilities on the first floor which we found very helpful!  It also has wickedly fast internet.  It would be a solid 5 stars all around except the floors were quite dirty when we arrived.  Luckily we found the vacuum cleaner and cleaned them ourselves so that we could happily follow scandinavian tradition and take our shoes off at the door.  ;o)"

Pär had excellent communication throughout, provided plenty of useful information regarding our stay in Stockholm and was very welcoming (even had a bottle of champagne waiting for us!). 

The apartment itself was exactly as described and was safe, quiet, clean and comfortable. The location was great for us, about a 15 minute walk from downtown Stockholm, but right next to multiple easy public transport options. The neighborhood was great as well, with plenty of grocery stores, restaurants, etc nearby, plus a lovely stretch of waterfront nearby to relax at. 

Loved staying at Pär's place, would highly recommend and stay there again when in Stockholm."

We felt really at home in the flat and all you need is there. The bed is super comfortable. The bathroom is small but it worked fine. We also used the laundry in the basement.

Everything that has been written about Sofie as a host as well about the apartment is absolutely true and I can hardly add new facts.
From the first request onwards Sofie was extremely friendly, helpful and nice. She answered all questions before and during our stay quickly and detailed and was always ready to help. 
The apartment is brilliantly located and an excellent starting point for the exploration of Stockholm. What we liked in particular is the dining room which is really comfortable and spacious.
It goes without saying that we recommend this accomodation by all means."

Check in was very easy and Menaf left very thorough instructions. The bed was comfortable and the area of town very quiet and on the water. Very close to running trails around Södermalm. Overall very close to everything we wanted to see by way of the metro close by. Couldn’t have asked for more from an Airbnb! Many thanks
974175,107402017,2016-10-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Everything was just GREAT! The host Jesper welcomed me and my friends in his apartment. He gave us a \"house tour\" by introducing everything in his house, so you don't have to guess what in where or how to use the things. The house equipped with high-tech appliances and they are super users-friendly! They got everything in their kitchen and it's big, made us cooked twice in 3 nights. Everything in the house was clean. They have 3 rooms for total, the host will ask your sleeping preference before your arrival and set up accordingly. Apple TV is provided, so you can watch some movies. Just 2-3 stations to T-centralen (The Central) and Galamstan (Old Town), 5 mins walk to \"T\" Tunnuelbana. It's convenience.

Seriously, I'm kind of perfectionist but the experience in Jesper's place was really over the top. It delighted our trip in Stockholm indeed.

I will definitely recommend Jesper's place to everyone who can keep the place clean. =)"

I think my best airbnb find to date! It was better than the pictures. In fact i think the pictures do not give the apartment justice! Its just way better in person. Located near a metro station with a lot of nearby grocery and shops, it is surprisingly quiet and cosy. I just love it. The only downside is that with such an awesome place to stay, you just dont wanna leave. You'll be tempted to have a staycation!"

The house is big, my room was big and confortable too and the flat just reminded me of my times at university: the (Hidden by Airbnb) are young and handsome. And yes it's true, the house is near a wood and a lake and most of all is very easy to reach because is just three minutes walking from the last stop of the line 18 of the underground. I coudn't ask for more. As about Linnea, she's just nice and pretty, quite a sweet host. I recommend this choice."

The apartment had everything you could need and beds were very comfy. Perfect for 2 friends travelling together or a couple...3 people might find it a bit small if staying for longer than a couple of nights. All in all wouldn't hesitate to recommend Daniel's apartment if you're visiting Stockholm!"
1204621,130469316,2017-02-06T00:00:00.000Z,Nettan was an easy-going and helpful host. The place was as it is listed online. She offered good options on places to visit in Stockholm and was great company. I was also invited to a party which I was not prepared for and Nettan was generous enough to lend me her shoes and jewellery. I would definitely recommend this place to stay in Stockholm.

The house is in a very quiet neighbourhood but it's still very easy to access to the city center. The metro line is at 5 min. walk distance and you arrive to the center in ca 15 min. Around the house there is a restaurant, a bakery and big market where you can find everything for the kitchen. 
Anita's house is a clean, big and peaceful place with an excellent decoration. 
So I highly recommend you to book this beautiful house when you are in Stockholm."
581243,59087586,2016-01-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin is a great host, we felt comfortable in his apartment.
The location is good, in the calm part of the city, but with all necessary right at hand (shopping mall on the ground floor). 20 minutes of calm walk to the city center, same amount of time in other direction to the ferry.
The apartment is extremely clean, the bed is comfy, and we used the kitchen too, it contains everything needed for big cooking or just heating up.
There is also a drawer and shelfs in the room, which I found very useful."

Ubytování bylo moc příjemné a já i můj přítel jsme byli nadšení - pokoj vypadal, jako kdyby na nás přímo čekal.

The rest of the apartment is very cool. I have been there just two days and stayed very little at home, therefore I didn't really interact too much with the hosts. Nevertheless they seemed cool and interesting people."
556363,62525390,2016-02-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Beautiful apartment, nice and spacious. There were six of us and we fitted in just fine! Lennard was very friendly and helpful - I would recommend this apartment in a heartbeat!"

5 stars *****"
164448,44761555,2015-08-29T00:00:00.000Z,Lidia was very kind and accommodating. Her place is in a great location for exploring Sodermalm and easy walking distance to the cool Sofo area. It is a good value option for staying in Stockholm.

Highly recommend this apartment!
Highly recommend this apartment!
This apartment is absolutely cost-efficient, and it took us 2 minutes to the bus station nearby and 6 minuets  to the metro station, so it’s super convenient to go everywhere!
And there is a big supermarket near this apartment, so if you can easily buy everything you need.
Maud is so kind to us, she made us feel like staying in our own apartment! And she gave us a lot of advice, and if you want, you can talk a lot with Maud, She is very nice!
Of course, Sammy, Sammy is a little angel, OMG, I will miss Sammy. Haha 
So, I will recommend this apartment to my friends. Haha.
Thank you so much, Maud!"
755843,269213928,2018-05-27T00:00:00.000Z,"We loved the apartment. The photos did not do it justice, as it was cosy and homely with lots of personal touches, and is lived in by the owner occasionally. So, the books, photos and things in the kitchen added real character. It was also very quiet on the fourth floor, and just off the main road, so quieter.

Par was very hospitable, and checked us in with a warm welcome, with plenty of tips and left us sparkling wine. He also let us leave luggage for the day at the end of the stay, and was very easy to communicate with before the stay. This was only my third Air B and B, and the best yet.

The apartment is very handy (30 seconds walk) to bus routes 3 to the Old Town, 50 and 54 (to Kungstradgarden, where you catch no 7 tram to the Djurgarden attractions) so was excellent for public transport. 10 minutes walk to the City Hall, and 3 minutes to the waterside Malarpaviljorgen floating bar/restauarant). Metro 5 minutes away. Convenience store opposite, or ICA supermarket and several restaurants (we liked French Bergamott) with 5 minutes down a small hill). So, ideally situated, in a local but safe neighbourhood. 

Thanks Par."

302496,4633315,2013-05-17T00:00:00.000Z,"We loved our stay at Seta's apartment. The apartment is very very central. You can find anything you need in short distance such as a supermarket, bottle shop, ATM, nice restaurants, etc. The apartment is very nice and clean, quite huge and has everything you need. There are two very comfortable beds, free wireless and television with lost of channels. The kitchen is fully equipped. If we would come back to Stockholm we would definitely stay again in this apartment. Seta was a very welcoming and nice host. She gave us so many great advises for sightseeing and restaurants. We can recommend this apartment very very much."
904739,47657832,2015-09-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Hei.  I really enjoyed my stay at Menafs apartment. Everything was as Menafs described. It's starts with which bus I should take from the airport to the apartment, the way to the apartment until where the keys were.  The house/neighborhood is very quiet (haven't heard anyone).  Near the apartment is a nice area to take a walk along the river.  The public transport (metro) is just 5-10 min away and takes ca 10-15 min to Gamla Stan (old city). There are good restaurants and bars just a few min from the apartment.  Menaf is a really good host. The apartment has everything you need for a stay.  The bed and the sofa is really comfortable.  Everything was clean.  Thanks for this Menaf   Anytime again"

Sofie & Jesper ont été très chaleureux et accueillants avec nous. Leur appartement est plutôt spacieux (nous étions 5), moderne et joliment décoré. La cuisine est très moderne et bien équipée.
L'appartement est situé dans un quartier résidentiel plutôt calme, mais à une distance raisonnable à pied du centre-ville. Il y a une station de métro très proche, divers arrêts de bus, des commerces et des restaurants.

C'était l'appartement idéal pour notre séjour à Stockholm et il a largement contribué à la réussite de ce week-end entre filles!"
1212891,230846618,2018-01-29T00:00:00.000Z,Maud è stata molto gentile e disponibile. La casa e la stanza sono molto piccole ma alla fine per qualche giorno va benissimo; è vicinissimo alla fermata della metro con cui si può raggiungere il centro in dieci minuti. Pulizia e cortesia ottime!

We arrived late, about at midnight, and we couldn't find the house. There was a girl that open us and she didn't know what to do and stayed al the time at the phone with the assistant, so it was a little annoying because it was raining and we were outside to wait. Apart from that the room was fine, the house was clean, it was like to be at home. I regret that Ali wasn't there, probably we wouldn't have that problems at the beginning. At the end my opinion isn't bad, if you need to stay in Stockholm a couple of days it's good!"

Responses were very prompt from pre-booking (2mths plus in advance) to even 1 day before my arrival. Directions were given clearly. You do need to drag your stuff from Sodra station for around 5mins so do take note of that.

Upon check in, Lidia was present, she welcomed us like we are some long lost families. From the info she provided, I could have mistaken her for her pro advice on the sights to cover in Stockholms / admission fee prices to some and even which part of the train to stand in order to alight nearer to Saluhall at Ostermalm station (it's in front). Her attention to details and willingness to socialize with us provided a warm welcome to us. Room is good, coffee and tea was provided and toilet is super clean.

Thanks Lidia for your hospitality!"

The apartment was exactly as described and seen in the photographs in a great location. Round the corner from the apartment there was a deli, shops, restaurants and a short walk south took you to the waterside with beaches, bars and more places to eat. 

Although the description doesn't say there is a shared service for washing and drying clothes in the basement of the apartment. 

Thanks for having me stay!"

954832,77284523,2016-05-31T00:00:00.000Z,Mikael was a warm/friendly host. He was also very responsive; we received answers and replies for all our inquiries before and also during our stay. He came to the bus stop to pick us up and explained the areas around and also about the flat kindly with cares. The flat was clean and cozy. It was exactly as same as the pictures uploaded and a bit bigger than our expectation (we were 3 girls). The location was good to access to the city center and other tourist attractions. We walked and managed to visit most of the places we planned. The area was nice and safe as well. Highly recommended. Thanks Mikael for your warm hospitality.

Lotta's place was super nice and convenient: perfect location, very clean and cozy. A good  and relaxing place to come home to after a long conference day! I have zero complaints and would absolutely recommend staying here. Thank you, Lotta!"
1124388,32508566,2015-05-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Carl's apartment is great : well decorated, comfortable, you can read, listen to music... and there's a kitchen with everything you need. It is not far from the center : there's a bus stop just down the street, or you can also have nice walks by the water.
Carl is very welcoming, he explained us very clearly how to get to the apartment. We really appreciated his flexibility about check in/check out hours.
Long story short we definitely recommend this apartment for your stay in Stockholm !"

1212891,86236405,2016-07-15T00:00:00.000Z,Great spot near the water and very close to the city. Gorgeous walk along the water into the city and many of the places of interest. Maud was a fantastic host. She made me feel very welcome and was very accommodating. Maud was more than happy for me to ask questions and gave me lots of great tips about Stockholm. She was very informative when I arrived giving me all the information about the place so nothing was confused. The house is very clean and organised and I felt very comfortable there.
581243,7832361,2013-10-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Perfect central location with a tube station close to the appartment. Good bed. Nice and clean room, bath and kitchen. Very friendly and calm host.\""
900043,54765800,2015-11-23T00:00:00.000Z,"I never met Anneli but she provided easy instructions for getting to the apartment, where to pick up the key etc. It was all very quick and easy, no complaints at all. 

The apartment looks just like in the pics. Small, older place with a warm and cosy feel to it. Perfect for a couple or two friends. It was clean and the amenities did their job. The bathroom was fresh. 

The area is kind of semi urban. Not very happening but you'll find a few bars, stores and so on. Quite calm. The very nearby subway station and bus stop makes travel and commute a breeze, it only takes a few minutes by subway to get to livelier areas, the central station and so on."
1212891,138560998,2017-03-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Cozy room, metro station 5 minutes by foot, very nice and helpful Maud a friendly cat Sammy! :)"

Thanks for everything"
755843,150093333,2017-05-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Everything was as described and agreed. Par met us personally, gave guidelines for nice stay in Stockholm.
Really good and calm location, perfect accessibility by public transport, walk-able distance from downtown even for 9/10 years kids, nice playground within 15 minutes walk. Several supermarkets around the place.
Place to return in Stockholm."
1261445,22987969,2014-11-19T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment was exactly as on the pictures, with extra good surprises, such as the beautiful entrance, the view on the park, all the fresh and beautiful flowers, the warmth despite the cold outside.
As Marie-Louise was not well at the time of our stay, we did not get to meet her, which is a shame as it is part of the whole experience to meet with the local host, to get insider's experience and get to know the neighborhood quickly. My girlfriend and I only stayed 4 nights (I took her to Sweden on a surprise trip) and so I felt a bit lost in the Hornstull neighborhood. Despite this issue, the neighborhood is close to Slussen and Soho, and might be more of a booming area in the summer, whilst still providing some tasty venues for dinners and fika. 
The apartment in itself is splendid (the wooden floors, the color matching themes, the antiques…), there are blinds to block out the sun, and it's great to have no vis-a-vis, just the view of the park. Nice plants, modern kitchen fully equipped. The lighting is also great and adjustable, and is so important to create an atmosphere. The bed is simply amazing (big and so comfortable) and we had some of the best nights sleep there ever. The bathroom is cute and added to the coziness. The size of the apartment was perfect for us, with the couch area to hang out and watch series or read, have a cup of tea whilst listening to some music, which is separate from the bed and dressing area. 
Would recommend this apartment because it is totally awesome, and has a special 'something'  that makes it unique and special and that's what I look for in an Airbnb experience."

The environment is very serene and peaceful. The room is comfy as shown in the pictures and the user-friendly kitchen facility providing a good chance for cooking. However, the showering area is rather small as expected. For the accessibility, although it is approx. 15mins distance from metro station, the walking path is flat and greenery."
313763,97003314,2016-08-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Fantastic location, sun facing balcony, right in the heart of the city - very flexible in checking in and out. Thanks Martin."

Het appartement heeft goede voorzieningen: complete keuken, lekkere bedden, goede douche, buiten zitje. Het enige minpuntje vonden wij dat de woonkamer vrij donker is. 
Thomas en Madeleine zijn zeer behulpzaam en reageren snel op vragen. 
We hebben een topweek gehad!"

The room was spacious and welcoming (more lovely than the photos might suggest), with a nice view over Stockholm's coolest neighborhood. Just a few blocks away you'll find hip design shops, delicious cinnamon buns...and the rest of the city is easily walkable. Elisabeth made us feel so welcome, and we spent long mornings enjoying the spectacular breakfast spread she prepared and sharing stories - she has an amazing energy that's easy to get caught up with! A wonderful introduction to Stockholm."

The location is great (there are concerts in the local park you can hear but they end by 10pm), really close to a lovely beach and lots of cafes, shops and bars. It's very close to the metro station as well so there's easy access. Klara was very quick to respond, and we would recommend her and her home to anyone visiting Stockholm!"

The room was clear and you share the bathroom with other airbnb-guests, but that's comfortable as well. The location is recommendable; close to the old town.

The guest room is very clean and cozy as just like pictures. The bathroom was right next the room, So it was really convenient for me! You are also allowed to use his kitchen and you can have some bread and cereal for breakfast. I felt very easy in his house. Jarl is really friendly and thoughtful person. If I had chance to visit Stockholm, I would contact him again!"

206221,42247936,2015-08-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Elisabeth was very helpful in organising our stay.  She replied immediately to all messages.  The room is exactly as advertised (with the tiny exception that the two beds we rearranged to stand next to each other).  The whole flat is perfectly tidy.  The location is great, in a beautiful, very calm alley in the center of the 'hip' area of Stockholm.  Public transport is available within a few minutes' walking distance.  Breakfast was rich and delicious, and provided us a good start into our days.

Elisabeth is a true gem.  Her light-hearted nature and her incredible kindness made a true difference.  If you want to feel at home abroad, hers is the place to go."

It was great to know that we had a tremendously comfortable apartment to come back to after our wandering walks around the centre of Stockholm and expeditions farther afield. Seta was very welcoming and helpful. Her son Christopher helped us out, too. 

The location of Seta’s apartment was ideal. There are buses that stop outside the front door. The subway is a few blocks away. We could do our grocery shopping across the street. Pretty much any other kind of store we needed was within a block or two. Yet, the neighbourhood is quiet. 

We really look forward to coming and staying with Seta again."

When I arrived the room was made up beautifully with lots of information pamphlets and she left me  lovely jug of lemon water for the first night after having spent the day and evening helping my partner with his performance. The location of the apartment was superb and if you wanted to walk to most of the major sight seeing areas that was possible.

723539,128726067,2017-01-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Mathias's place was great. Very central - walking distance to all the good spots and no more than a 15 minutes by train to other hip parts of town. The place was clean, big, and a great spot to spend 3+ weeks in Stockholm. Mathias was very good with communication. I would recommend this apartment to anyone looking for a great place to stay in Stockholm."
1054406,140677152,2017-03-31T00:00:00.000Z,"We really enjoyed staying at the apartment! It was very clean, has everything that you need and is located in a nice neighborhood. Thomas and Madeleine were the perfect hosts and were very helpful with everything"
763407,24812298,2015-01-03T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed in Gabriella's appartement for three nights - the cosy and lovely appartement is perfect for four adults. And it's perfect located, we explored Stockholm by foot.
Communicating with Gabriella was the whole time very easy and she gave us lots of insider tips - especially for new years eve and some good restaurants so that we didn't feel that much as tourists :-)"
1212891,137542516,2017-03-16T00:00:00.000Z,"房子在离市中心较远的岛上,但是离公交站和地铁站都非常近,出行方便｡ 周边是居民区,不偏僻但很安静｡房东Maud细心周到,温柔可爱,生活用品和洗漱用品都准备齐全,房间里还有很好吃的糖果｡猫咪Sammy不太好动,性格安静,软萌软萌的;)"
819676,129360349,2017-01-30T00:00:00.000Z,It's always nice when an airbnb lives up to and exceeds expectations. I had such a nice stay. Check in and check out were  a breeze. I felt this this was a perfect location for a first time Stockholm visitor looking to stay central but not in the middle of the tourist bubble of the old town. Great size for a solo traveler but I think it would have felt cramped if I was traveling with anyone
1212891,535461203,2019-09-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice place, very clean, Maud is very friendly and informative. The place, although is not close from city center, can be reached by metro easily. Near supermarkets. Very friendly."
478105,40574782,2015-08-01T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment was exactly as described: on the top floor in a residential neighborhood, spacious with 2 balconies and 2 bathrooms, very quiet and only a short subway trip away from the city center. There is a convenient supermarket at each of the 2 subway stations near the apartment.
After a long day of exploring we especially enjoyed the massage chair and the Tempur mattresses! I don't know how I've survived 2 weeks vacation without these before ;)
We didn't meet with Christian in person, but the email & text contact was very nice and considerate.
All in all we had a great stay and can warmly recommend this appartment!"
1124388,128221543,2017-01-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Carl is very nice and truly dedicated to his hosts.
The apartment is very cosy and charmful (especially for the music and book lovers).
This is the perfect place to stay and discover Stockholm and its atmosphere !"
299154,19739811,2014-09-17T00:00:00.000Z,Daniel was very communicative prior to arrival and really went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed.  The lists of places of interests/restaurants/grocery stores was very very handy!  the apartment was exactly as described and even easier and more convenient than I thought it would be!  His flat will be me first thought on my next visit to Stockholm.
755843,484628347,2019-07-09T00:00:00.000Z,Pär’s apartment was perfect. It is in a fantastic location - close to public transport but also you can walk everywhere in Stockholm and this apartment is in a prime location. It is also very comfortable. We utilized both the bedroom and the Murphy bed (pull down) and were so comfortable there. Pär was always quick to reply and had everything set up for us when we arrived. Will definitely stay here again in the future!
299154,38657296,2015-07-17T00:00:00.000Z,"En super hyggelig lejlighed med en perfekt placering. Mange butikker og caféer lige om hjørnet! Lejligheden var ret lille, men vi var kun to personer, så det fungerede rigtig godt. Og der var en fantastisk altan som vi nød godt af!"
770995,334110804,2018-10-08T00:00:00.000Z,"A great apartment that comfortably accomdated 6 people. Clean, spacious and close to some nice restaurant.

Peter is an excellent host."

A great experience all around, and the neighbourhood is very nice also."
1182616,351558006,2018-11-23T00:00:00.000Z,Everything was ok
259025,1160546,2012-04-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Ali is a very nice host. The room was very comfortable, the bathroom and kitchen very clean and very steady. The place is a little bit far from the center, but the price and the quality are so attractive. Thanks to Ali for his welcome."
541875,6119851,2013-07-30T00:00:00.000Z,"This is a very quaint apartment. We felt very much at home here. So much so that my friend and I kept referring to it as \"our apartment.\" The neighborhood of Karlaplan is very lovely, and there is a mall and parks within two blocks that have everything we could possibly need. It's a short walk from the garden, museums, metro, and the amusement park. Martin was a really great host. He was out of town in Berlin but it felt like he was around the corner with every question I had. He kept in touch throughout our stay and ensured that we had a wonderful time in Stockholm."
533880,10231051,2014-02-08T00:00:00.000Z,I cannot fault Jarl on his instructions; he answered emails almost instantly and the directions to his apartment were excellent.   The room was very comfortable and more than adequate for my needs.  Jarl was very friendly without being intrusive and made me feel very welcome in his home. I would definitely recommend his apartment to others planning to visit Stockholm.
581243,158732511,2017-06-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Thanks so much Edwin! You really came through on short notice… Your communication was fantastic, your home was very clean, and your place is also  central. I was in a jam since my flight got canceled and you saved the day!"
1251466,79543385,2016-06-13T00:00:00.000Z,Dean ans friends were nice and the room was very clean
688947,47215816,2015-09-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Communicating with Alexandre from the beginning of my booking to the end of our stay was great.  The room is exactly as you see in the photo, simple, bright and clean.  The bathroom is also very clean.  My partner slept on a mattress on the floor as the bed is only a single bed but both of us were very comfortable and felt at ease in Alexandre's home.  The weekend we stayed Alexandre had his son over but both of them were very quiet.  Alexandre's home is an easy 10 minute walk to the nearest T-bana station, Skarpnack, and your ride will take you just over 15 minutes into Stockholm central.  Alexandre's home is definitely value for money as although you need to take a train into town, you will definitely not find as nice or clean of a hostel in the city center."
608672,348529223,2018-11-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Karl’s apartment was great for a quick trip to Stockholm. Very convenient to Central Station, other public transit, shopping, and more. The unit was equipped with everything one would need for a stay in the city."
1153177,5364802,2013-06-26T00:00:00.000Z,"It was a great place to stay. Terry was very special- open-minded, friendly and wellcoming. We had nice enenings together and great conversations. His appartement is big and close to central STockholm. We really liked all the flowers he had arranged for us in every single room. We highly recommend his location."
553914,141446572,2017-04-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Sibelle has been a great host ! From when I booked she's been helpful to help me plan my trip. Then I felt really welcome at her place and she gave me lots of tips to discover Stockholm. 
I had a great time in the city, and a perfect stay at her place !"
242188,109226892,2016-10-20T00:00:00.000Z,"The hostess Lidia was extremely friendly and welcoming, and she provided very detailed route description to her place as well as a lot of tourist information. I 100% enjoyed my stay at her place and would definitely recommend it to everyone."

He was very easy with my late check-in, made me feel welcome from the first minute and was easy to approach regarding all kinds of questions. I slept very well in the bed and enjoyed the quiet and friendly neighboorhood (a lot of families). Metro to the centre is just 2 minutes away, takes around 15 minutes to the central station."
688947,55633974,2015-12-03T00:00:00.000Z,We had a nice stay at Alexandre's. He was welcoming and made sure we had everything we needed. It was pretty easy to get into the centre with T-bana.

608672,111365968,2016-10-30T00:00:00.000Z,It Is the first time for me to stay in a historical building with over 100years. Nice location but the bathroom is too small without a standard shower space.
1117037,462426993,2019-06-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice, big and fresh room with a big and very comfortable bed! The appartment is located in a nice area and very close to the subway. I loved the outdoor place just outside the building! Great for a calm breakfast in the sun :)"
274876,9421389,2013-12-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Our family stay at Emma's apartment was really nice. The flat is comfortable, quiet and large enough for 5 people. It is well situated to visit Stockholm and in a nice neighborhood."

as much this time. Quiet but very centrally located. Close to everything.
We walked everywhere. To restaurants, shopping, grocery stores, museums and the train station/ Cityterminalen. Took the commuter train to the new mall in Solna, The Mall of Scandinavia."
1248490,36648878,2015-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,Our host was wonderful.  She met us at the apartment and was very helpful explaining everything to us.  Maria's apartment was bright and immaculate and well stocked.  It is a great location close to shopping and restaurants and within walking distance to downtown and Old Town.  We were sorry that we had such a short time there.  We would definitely go back and would highly recommend this spot to anyone.  It was perfect for four people.  Thank you Maria.
608672,334005158,2018-10-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Perfekte Lage! Wir haben uns in der Unterkunft sehr wohl gefühlt. Es war tatsächlich etwas hellhörig, aber das hat uns persönlich nicht so gestört. Für einen kleinen Städtetrip kann ich die Unterkunft nur empfehlen."
1248490,15903535,2014-07-18T00:00:00.000Z,"We've been for 3 days in Stockholm with our childeren. The apartment was comfortable. nice and clean. It is a good location,  also a lot of playground for the childeren en very nice restaurants. Maria can tell you about the city and if there's something or you want someting to now you can call her.

647314,36111651,2015-06-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Mallika's apartment is in an excellent location. Very easy to get to, with clear instructions from Mallika. We loved that we were very close to some of the best coffee places in Stockholm! The apartment is very clean and the bedroom is spacious. We enjoyed our stay in Stockholm."
299154,183827960,2017-08-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Loved this location really close to the trains and busses and also to old town.  The apartment was really clean which was wonderful.  There was a small lift which was fantastic as coming from Australia we had big bags to take upstairs.  The balcony was a great escape in the evening to sit and enjoy a drink with the mass of people below.   Your apartment was so close to the action but away enough not to be annoyed by any outrageous noise.  We were a little concerned about the bed, however it was really comfortable.   Also wifi was excellent.   Thanks we loved this cozy apartment."

It was about 15 Minuten all from the Metro Station and next to a supermarket at the Station itself. We Loved the quiet Area, just about 13 Minuten away from TCentralen:) this City is just wonderful! Annas bed was more than cosy and comfy, her Apartment was all in all Nice and cute:) we enjoyed staying there !"

164448,5230802,2013-06-19T00:00:00.000Z,Lidia is very friendly and helpful. Her place is fantastically located and reasonably priced. I happily recommend staying with Lidia to anyone visiting Stockholm.

575371,105515146,2016-10-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Both Tomas and Guru made our absolutely one to remember. They welcomed us into their home with great hospitality and were full of really useful advise on what to do and where to eat.
The positioning of the bathroom though separate from the room meant that we didn't encroach on each other in anyway and the Wifi was superb !
If you are a walker you'll find all the sights are easy to reach without too much exertion though Söder station (less than 5 minutes from the apartment) is just one stop to Centrum and Arlanda Express !
The immediate area has a great vibe with plenty of scope for bar and restaurants.
We recommend Tomas and Guru as ideal hosts,
Johnny"
1212891,13416716,2014-05-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Dear Maud, We had a pleasant stay at your place! You are very attentive and helpful. We liked your nice, clean and cozy flat and your adorable cats :) This was our first time to Stockholm and we hope not the last one. Thank you for the hospitality.

Iryna and Stanislav"
1234960,16336819,2014-07-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Jacob is the perfect host! With some goodies for the first evening and breakfast in the morning he makes you feel comfortable right away. He is reliable, perfect to communicate with, always available if questions come up and feeds you with some insider-information about his hometown Stockholm.
His house is very clean, comfortable and stylish. You will find everything that you need for a relaxing holiday (including lots of towels, sheets, beauty products, a washing machine with washing powder, bicycles...)The neighborhood is save and quiet, there is a big garden with a barbecue and a trampoline for the children. Public transportation and a large supermarket are easily available and within a short walking distance.
Jacob is such a generous host and offers so many amenities, that staying at his house really gives you the extra bonus to enjoy this wonderful city.
Jacob, thank you very much for this wonderful week at your house, we definitely would love to come back!

The flat itself was in fantastic condition and Martin was kind enough to leave some essentials for me and my girlfriend. 
He was a very welcoming host and I highly recommend staying at his place."

He was flexible about arrival and departure times, he made sure that we had everything we needed, and he even provided Stockholm maps and brochures. The apartment is just as pictured - and it was very clean. It was in a safe area with nearby grocery store, post office, and other shops, and only about a 20-minute train ride into the city.

916806,83579687,2016-07-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Das Haus liegt sehr idyllisch in einer reinen Wohngegend. Das Appartment ist recht grosszügig und für 2 Personen auch für mehrere Tage sehr gut nutzbar. Alle notwendigen Geräte und Utensilien zum Kochen sind vorhanden. Wir haben nichts vermisst. Die grosse Holzveranda lädt zu langen Aufenthalten im Sommer ein und man kann den Sonnenuntergang in vollen Zügen geniessen. In 15 Minuten ist man zu Fuss an der U-Bahnstation und von da an in ca. 40 Minuten mitten im Herzen von Stockholm. Die Wohngegend ist sehr, sehr ruhig, also sehr gut geeignet um nach einer ausgiebigen Sightseeing-Tour in der Stadt den Tag in aller Ruhe ausklingen zu lassen. Die Dokumentation ist sehr ausführlich beschrieben und der Check-In ist anhand der detaillierten Beschreibung einfach zu bewerkstelligen. Trotz Ferienabwesenheit war die Kommunikation gewährleistet und hat super geklappt."

The room was just as described, spacious and with a nice balcony. And the kitchen was very nice and cozy. The location is very convenient, only 2 metro stops away from the centrum.  We had a nice stay, and I would recommend Peter's appartment."
900043,224119939,2018-01-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Endroit sympa pour l'été seulement, elle est loin du centre ville donc il faut rentrer un peu tot sinon vous ratez le metro et vous resterez dehors, sinon l'appartement est bien pour un court séjour car y a pas de wifi et les matelas sont pas tres confortables.

Sehr schöne Wohnung, sehr ruhig, lediglich das Bad ist etwas klein und das Geräusch der Wasserpumpe gewöhnungsbedürftig. Aber dafür ist man in einer Öko-Siedlung, die sich sehr positiv von dem, das man sonst von Stockholm an Wohngebieten sieht, unterscheidet. Stockholm-City ist mit dem Auto von dort gut erreichbar."
873383,73103745,2016-05-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Isabelle is a very kind and warm host, she helped us with our bag on the way to her apartment.

875505,317010804,2018-09-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Great experience, prehaps the best appartment i rented through Airbnb, although it's not cheap. Location is ideal, space is more than enough for two people (in great contrast to hotels of the same price), there is a coffee machine and minimum kitchen equipment so that you can do breakfast or quick lunch, there's a washing machine and dishwasher, making the trip even more relaxed, and overall: it's very cosy, yet spacious and simple, just what you would expect in your perfect accomodation.:)  And the owner, Electra, is very welcoming and easy-going."
1153177,37952475,2015-07-12T00:00:00.000Z,"We (family of 5) enjoyed staying at this convient comfortable apartment. Terry welcomed us with a surprise dinner spread of Swedish treats, which were most welcome after a long travel day. The unit sleeps 5 comfortably. Perfect location-15 minute walk to downtown or 5 min to subway! Also just 5 minute walk/jog to a beautiful large park with walking/running trails. Terry was a friendly helpful host."
1244657,189976583,2017-09-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Nic and Usha are very gratious hosts, social and informative while respecting my privacy. They were very helpful, lending be a tablet so that I could email my mom.  The room was clean and quiet. The place is really well located, in Slussen just across the bridge from the old town (Gamla Stan) and two minutes from the subway and a bus terminal, and 5-7 minutes from the ferry to Djurgarden island with a lot of sights/museums. Very good value for money. Very highly recommended."
757320,16202350,2014-07-23T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment of Barbara is on Södermalm, maybe a ten minute walk from Gamla Stan and the trendy parts of Södermalm (like Sofo) and some nice cafes around.
It is big and clean (as the room and the shared bathroom are). The room itself is big enough for two,
has a wardrobe, two chairs and a small table and a window, but it´s facing the main street, so it´s noisy (if you open the window), you should be aware of that. Barbara was easy to handle with, always friendly and mostly in the background. If you´re looking for a cheap option in a good (and safe) neighbourhood and you´re ok with some street noise (with open windows) you can go there."
581243,2090134,2012-08-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin is extremely nice. He is very tidy. You can tell he is the kind of person who cleans up after himself after everything he does.

The apartment is in a great location. I walked everywhere:
* From T-Centralen 30 minutes
* To Gamla Stan 25 minutes
* To Djurgården 20 minutes.
* National musset, Modernamuseet: 20 minutes
But if you want to take the metro, the station is right outside the entrance to the apartment complex.

Edwin will meet you in Karlaplan and take you to his place if you have trouble finding it. Because it's so close to Karlaplan (I call it the circle garden), it's easy to find your way home with a map. It's like the center of Ostermalm and many streets lead straight to it.

I felt very safe. You need at least 3 keys just to get in (4 if he's not home). The neighborhood feels very safe too.

Inside is very modern and clean. Maybe this will describe it enough: When you lock the door to the bathroom, the outside handle glows red to let the outside know there is someone in there. The shower is clever and space-saving. It's made of 2 glass doors that swing open to form a box. When you're done, they swing towards the wall so there's more room. Although, I thought the bathroom was plenty spacious anyway.

There's a Fruit/vegetable stand outside along with a small street vendor that sells fast food, and a McDonald's. But if you are serious about buying groceries, Edwin will tell you where you can get them cheaper.

Don't be fooled by the street view here. That's the back part. The front, where you will most likely always come from, is very nice.

It's very quiet even though you are above a major street. At night, it is almost dead silent. And the room has a double-paned window and a blackout shade. It is annoying, however, when it rains because you can hear the loud rain droplets hit the sill. If that bothers you, bring ear plugs. I usually fall asleep very easily, and the sound kept me up.

There is a place to do laundry downstairs, but you have to get Edwin to reserve it ahead of time.

In terms of tourist advice, I didn't get much from him. So don't rely on him for the best places to eat. I didn't ask, but I doubt he's exactly the local expert I would hope for in terms of things to do either. He's Bolivian, but has been in Stockholm for many years. He'll give you a map, but that's the best information I could get from him. The places I listed above were good enough for me."
1212891,6688211,2013-08-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud was a really very nice host and we enjoyed our stay for four days in Stockholm in her flat pretty much! 
Although sharing the flat with her, the privacy was everytime respected and given. 
The flat is really good located and gives every opportunity to reach every point of the city easily."
1124388,51303708,2015-10-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Carl is a great host! His apartment is perfect, we found all we needed and it is well-located! It's easy to go in the center of Stockholm by bus!   Definitely recommended ! :)"
620848,7066939,2013-09-05T00:00:00.000Z,"We were very lucky to find and choose Hanna's appartment for our staying in Sweden!

Hanna was very helpful from the very beginning; She answered to all our e-mails, met us in Stockholm at the nearby train station and showed us the way to her appartment.

I cannot think of anything that this appartment lacked of! It was cozy, comfortable, with clean towels and sheets, a refrigerator, microwave, and a dishwasher too. We were able to make our own breakfast - Hanna showed us the way to the nearest market, too. In a few words, we literally felt like home!

We had a wonderful stay, Stockholm is a beautiful city and Hanna's place made our trip even more comfortable and easier! We recommend her and her place for anyone who'd like to spend some days in Stockholm!"
299154,56539755,2015-12-14T00:00:00.000Z,Amazing stay! Daniel was so sweet and generous with his place! PERFECT location!

1137050,43472563,2015-08-20T00:00:00.000Z,"I rented Gabriel's flat in Södermalm's Nytorget neighborhood of Stockholm for 2 months with my mom and my dog, Laila. Gabriel is very friendly - he met us at the door when we arrived and helped us get settled. His apartment is gorgeous - beautiful old wood floors, antiques, lots of books, a real artist's oasis. It worked perfectly for us. The neighborhood is swimming with restaurants, cafes, and bars from yummy and affordable to high end and fancy and  and shops from vintage funky to high-end designer. There are parks and open spaces everywhere. Söder is my favorite island of Stockholm - very old with beautiful 18th century houses and cobblestone streets, and it was great to get to know this part of it. Very hipster, if that is your thing. I'll definitely be back!"
1182616,517021162,2019-08-25T00:00:00.000Z,"The host, Peter, replies to the questions immediately if needed. The location is excellent. Many supermarkets around and it’s easy to get the river with great night view and also the city center by walk. The apartment is well organized. We feel pretty comfortable for the time there! Definitely recommend!"
624886,175149620,2017-07-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Great apartment. Spacious. Everything needed for a family to have a good time in Stockholm. If you're going to all the attractions in djurgarden everyday, it's a bit far.

We had a blast and Oskar arrnaged everything needed for a good Stockholm holiday!"
1119738,4870437,2013-05-29T00:00:00.000Z,We stayed overnight in Stockholm for we had to take an early to Finland on the next morning. Anna was very helpful and flexible with our tight schedule. She left us my ourselves to enjoy the beautiful and peaceful home of hers.
875505,516476072,2019-08-24T00:00:00.000Z,Foi tudo como acertado. A localização é excelente. A anfitriã muito cordial e educada. Se ofereceu para dar dicas da cidade. O local é bonito e amplo.
1234960,147890436,2017-04-29T00:00:00.000Z,The host canceled this reservation 15 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
688947,2875660,2012-11-13T00:00:00.000Z,"The stay at Alexandres home was really comfortable and cozy. Everything was super clean and it is perfect for two people to sleep in this room. We were allowed to use the kitchen as well as coming and going whenever we want.
Near to Alexandres place is a supermarket and the Metro station. You need about 20 mintes to the Central station in Stockholm.
If you want a nice stay with a open minded host I can recommend you Alexandres home :)"
514210,21120845,2014-10-12T00:00:00.000Z,"We (three people) stayed for six weeks at Margareta's flat. She rent out two rooms and a bathroom and we shared kitchen with her family. She explained everything necessary and was always very friendly and polite. Her children were nice and considerate as well. The rooms were clean and cosy and the housing complex was quite nice. The flat is close to a supermarket, some restaurants and the busstop. 
The place in the fridge and also in the cupboard was a bit too small for
Three. But Margareta was always tried to let us in the kitchen when we want to cook something. 
We had a good time at Margareta's place and wish all the best to her and the childs. Thanks a lot!"

Once inside the appartment was very nice and Karl showed me a map of things to see and do. 
The bed was very comfy and place was quite. 
Close walking distance to everything."
900043,127948785,2017-01-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice and cosy place with an interesting ezoteric aura, good location to the underground. Unfortunalety the discription does not say that there is no wifi or internet, only crossed off from the extras, was not evident for me... But we had a really good time there, the bed is really comfortable, all is fine for a romantic weekend."
608672,159442915,2017-06-11T00:00:00.000Z,Great location in easy walking distance to most attractions and very close  to public transport. We enjoyed our stay here very much and Karl J was a great host with excellent communication that made the experience even more pleasurable.
608672,23711610,2014-12-08T00:00:00.000Z,Karl's comfortable little apartment was a great place to explore downtown Stockholm from. Just a few steps from the door and i found myself in the middle of the shopping district and a few minutes later I was in the old city. Karl handled all special requests with easy grace and made me feel welcomed. I will definitally be back.
1144069,215011080,2017-11-27T00:00:00.000Z,Perfekt läge och mysig lägenhet. Snabb kommunikation och hjälpsamma!
624886,9645446,2014-01-04T00:00:00.000Z,Oskar and Lisa were great hosts and their place was great for a week in Stockholm. Most definitely recommended for those with young children as well as those without.

283446,2245870,2012-09-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Vidhatri was a very kind host who was willing to share her advice on places of interest. The accommodation was very clean and organized, the independent room was comfortable. The commute into the city was very convenient. It is near to city and Airport.  Ideal location for me.  I enjoyed her Special Indian Vegetarian food.  Delicious.  Yummy.. Highly recommended to stay here for your trip to Stockholm."

Really loved this place. So I strongly can recommend it!"
862528,6560698,2013-08-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Arne and Katinka gave us a warm welcome and some helpful tips for our stay. They organized a crib and a high chair for our friend's baby.
The house is located in a really nice neighbourhood with a supermarket, subway station and a huge playground (for small and big kids) just around the corner. The motorway is near so you're in Stockholm in about 20-25 minutes.
The house is great, but the main bedroom has no doors to the living room downstairs and is a walk through room to the second bedroom/nursery. That might be no problem for one family with kids, but for two couples it's not ideal. Anyways we had a great time at Arne's and Katinka's place and really enjoyed our stay!

Thanks,
Thomas"

259025,7127750,2013-09-07T00:00:00.000Z,The apparment is indeed a bit off the center but totally manageable with the travel post recomended in the description. The room is spacious and everything is very tidy. Ali was a nice host and was very supportive.

She sat down with us and showed us all of the good spots around Stockholm and even gave us tea and cookies! The room was very clean, and it is quite close to the subway stop. and I would highly recommend anyone to stay here! We would definitely come back and stay here if we were in Stockholm again!"
1182616,70547676,2016-04-18T00:00:00.000Z,"The room was really easy to find, even when Peter couldn't make it to welcome us. Good facilities, comfortable bed and a very cozy room. The linen, towels etc were perfectly set for us as we arrived. The private balcony was amazing, especially with the warm morning sun shining right in!"
1054406,296113974,2018-07-25T00:00:00.000Z,Beautiful neighborhood and home!  Host was very helpful as well.
242188,45304298,2015-09-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia was a very good host and nice lady.  She sent explicit and detailed directions on how to get to her apartment.  She was also waiting for me upon my arrival direct from SFO, which was very welcoming.  

The room is small but very clean as is the entire apartment and bathroom.   There is a basic desk, nightstand and single bed.   The bathroom is shared with other guests.   

There were kids playing outside and I had to leave the window open for air so you can hear them playing but the neighborhood is very suburban and quiet with very few cars around.  It was very peaceful and serene.  

It is a 5-10 minute walk to any food or restaurant so there's no much immediately below the complex but the train is closely.

Lidia spent a lot of time to give me tips on where to go and what to see in Stockholm.  She answered all my questions and was a great host.  She looked after me with times that my train was leaving the next morning and provided anything I asked for (i.e. adapter)."
647314,38976912,2015-07-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Great location, beautiful & stylish room. Södermalm is fantastic if you want to explore Stockholm in only a few days. Mallika has a great sense of style and we felt very comfortable staying at her place. Thank you!"
1244657,5802207,2013-07-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Nic and Usha's place is the perfect location if you want to be in the middle of it all. Just a stone away from Galam Stan in the Södermalm district, the apartment is very close to the best coffee shops, bakeries, grocery stores, bars, clubs, designer and second hand shops in Stockholm. Despite its central location the flat remains quiet, there is a small inner open courtyard in the middle of the building in which I could lounge. 
The apartment is in a historic building which has been tastefully revamped to modern times. The Swedish painter Anders Zorn (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) had his studio in the attic, I had never heard of him until my visit to Stockholm and I was happily surprised when I saw several of his painting hung on the walls of the National Museum of Art! 
Nic replied to my request quickly and was extremely accommodating even though he was abroad! A competitive price, great location, and caring host makes this apartment the best stay in Stockholm, I would definitely return."
974175,403115000,2019-01-20T00:00:00.000Z,Sofies and Jespers place was perfect for our weekend trip! Communication was fast and the place is gorgeous. We were more than satisfied.

The location is also a very good starting point to explore Stockholm and everything you need is nearby (supermarket, bus, restaurants, nice little Shops, etc.). Highly recommended!"
688947,45734665,2015-09-05T00:00:00.000Z,"We spent 3 nights at Alex place. He is very friendly host. He welcomed us cheerfully and gave an extra mattress. Alex is unusual guy as he agreed to host us three people. He is very optimistic person what we noticed from the first sight. He worked in the very morning but still stayed in contact with us. Alex is definitely host that I can recommend. Just great, thanks!
Room was very clean and whole apartment tidy as shown on pictures. It is located few minutes walking from metro station and then ca. 15 minutes to central bus terminal. ICA supermarket is on the way to metro.
Hey Alex, sorry for that cooking quite late..."

Very clean and neat space with everything I needed. Having a lift was helpful as I had a lot of luggage! I’d definitely stay here again.
299154,171832286,2017-07-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Nicely located. But be sure you confirm with Daniel that he has made the bed and set out soap and toilet paper in the bathroom. Also, his apartment is very small- not appropriate for more than 2 people in my opinion. The double bed is just a platform. Daniel lives there so there are a lot of things overflowing in every space like cleaning supplies in the small bathroom, drawers overflowing with things. We arrived late after a delayed flight to an unmade bed (there were sheets rolled up on the thin mattress- I had to make the bed,) no soap and no toilet paper. We had communicated with him via email several times so I think he is conscientious but we were (Website hidden by Airbnb) toilet paper? Also, although the neighbor he sent us to, Rolf, was very kind, it was stressful thinking we'd arrive after a 10 hr flight to find the Neighbor not at home. Fortunately, the Neighbor was at home but I would not take such a chance again after such a long flight and so much depending on a neighbor being home to give us the key."
299154,25188451,2015-01-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Daniel was incredibly welcoming and organized. The apartment was very well kept and clean. Daniel even laid out some chocolates and city guides for us (as well as some printouts of places he recommended). Overall, this was a fantastic experience and I would absolutely recommend staying at Daniel's lovely apartment."
475409,27670885,2015-03-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Cor was a great host. She met us at her apartment and even went and got a few basics for breakfast for us. The apartment isn't huge, but it is comfortable and does have everything needed and did the trick perfectly for my wife and I. The neighbourhood was our favourite in Stockholm, with lots of cool shops & restaurants and great transport links. Thanks!"
897584,4555275,2013-05-12T00:00:00.000Z,"We really enjoyed staying at Viveka's place. Her place is a little oasis in the south of Stockholm - beautiful, peaceful and cozy. And the newly made patio so nice!!
Viveka is very friendly, she took the time to pick us up at the metro station and to show us how everything works in her house. 
Thank you a lot!"
1212891,518797333,2019-08-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud (and Sammy the cat) was a very warm and welcoming host. We were a little surprised that Maud did not have a bedroom as the second bedroom was occupied by a student lodger.  This meant Maud slept on the sofa in the lounge,  adjacent to our bedroom, behind a curtain. This wasn’t a problem, we just had to be mindful to be quiet when going to the bathroom or kitchen during the night. Maud goes to extraordinary lengths to give you space for food and toiletries in her house. 
Even though check out is 10am, she had allows guests to leave their luggage there until later in the day, she really is very kind.
The local supermarket, equivalent to a TESCO express, is only 5-10 min walk, nearest tube is 10 min walk. The waterfront is also only 10 min walk which is where we sat and ate breakfast in the sun and had a swim on a hot day!
Great public transport links to city centre, however, if you’ve got 45 mins to spare, you could do the 4km walk all along the waters edge into the centre of Stockholm, which gives you a lovely opportunity to take in the sights. 
All in all, brilliant host, fantastic location and really good price. 
What are you waiting for - book now!"
647314,165316548,2017-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,We had everything we needed at Mallika's place and more- two beautiful kitties graced our stay! It was easy to get around by foot and train and there were many nice cafes around. Would recommend!
220851,473219910,2019-06-21T00:00:00.000Z,Funkade klockrent att bo där under en kortare vistelse för arbete. Vasastaden är ett väldigt fint område och lägenheten vara nära både restauranger och matvarubutiker.

647314,7069563,2013-09-05T00:00:00.000Z,The apartment was in a great condition and super well located. Mallike was a very gracious and respectful host. Strongly recommending it!
620848,2319847,2012-09-17T00:00:00.000Z,"A very nice appartment in a very pleasant location. Me and my family stayed for 5 days and we enjoy to stay in Älvsjö.  The flat is very near to train station (3/5min walking) but inside the house is very quiet. Close to the house there are green area, a pharmacy and 2 supermarkets.
Inside the house everything was available, also a rain coat for the rainy days:) 
The host Hanna was amazing, a very kind person and disposal at all times. She came to the airport and guide us to the house. She also gave us good tips to visit Stockholm 
I would definitely be booking again whenever i visit and would highly recommend for everyone, specially if you are travelling with kids."

The location is close to one of the train stops and very good bars are all within walking distance. Karl has Stockholm travel information in the desk drawers, at your convenience. Great stay and right in City Center. Would definitely recommend this place!"

1182616,86970359,2016-07-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Me and my Friends stayed for 2 Nights in Stockholm, during this time Peter has been our Host.
He has a very sympatic appereance and he is a kind person. If you have a Question just ask him, he will answer you fluently in english so the conversation is without any problems. He also got some nice advices for you about Bars or the metro, which will be an advantage for you. Our room was comfortably and clean, during our Time at Peters appartment we had two neighbours, so we had to share the bath with them, but it was ok ,because everyone left the bathroom in a clean way. Our room has also a balcony which is very comfy. One big advantage was / is that Peters appartment is central, so you can drop off there easily with the bus from arlanda airport, without walking a long distance 

All in all Peter is a great Host!"

Everything is as described, and perfectly convenient. The flat is even prettier in real life. It's a perfect nest for 5 friends coming to Stockholm. The kitchen is loaded with everything (utensils, kitchen appliances and basics) a gourmet would like to cook with. We directly felt at home at Mallika's and the neighborhood was incredible. Mariatorget is a nice and trendy area nestled between the hip Hornstull and the popular Slussen-Sofo area, the perfect spot for a busy yet cozy stay.

Although we weren't fortunate enough to meet Mallika, the indications were very clear and communication perfect. We let ourselves in easily and she answered all our questions to help us. Furthermore she even let an architecture and nature guide to Stockholm that were very useful. 

Thank you so much for everything Mallika. This is a must-go!"

The location is perfect for exploring sodermalm and is 10 min from the subway. Security was good and it was quiet. The living area has a lovely big comfortable couch to relax in. The apartment was very clean. Was a pleasure to stay there! Note the bathroom has a hand held shower over bath which can be awkward to use if you're not used to it! I highly recommend Anette's apartment. Thank you very much. The three of us had a wonderful time there!"

The bed is a little bit firm as it's a sofa bed but the overall experience is great.
Thanks guys for making my first experience with airbnb that good."

The apt was small but cozy. Kitchen is fully equipped. N

Laundry was in basement and needed to be reserved before hand.

Bathroom is a bit uncomfortable and can use some cleaning."
581243,1994043,2012-08-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin's apartment is very clean and modern — in a perfect location for Stockholm sight seeing. There is a CityBikes rack directly outside the complex's entrance, which is built above a full shopping center. Everything from groceries to clothes to a quick meal are literally two minutes away.

I stayed at his place during the London 2012 Olympics, and while I wasn't in the apartment much I enjoyed chatting with him while watching whatever event was being televised."
897584,7726554,2013-09-30T00:00:00.000Z,"It was a very quiet and peacful place to stay - some surrounding nature and central for rest of Stockholm. The aparatment was clean, wel equipped and cosy. Viveka made everything easy and was helpful."

I really recommend this flat if you plan on going to Stockholm!"
819676,124974582,2017-01-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Conveniently located, close to the subway (although we pretty much walked everywhere). The room & private bathroom were tidy and neat; the bed was cozy as well, and love the little TV in the room. The room was smaller than expected but the public area and shared kitchen were huge and got pretty much everything we needed. We had a few words with Andy and he was a very friendly and nice host, overall an enjoyable stay and this place is high recommended!"
838442,166291655,2017-07-03T00:00:00.000Z,"This apartment is centrally located and is within walking distance of Stockholm's \"Old Town\", which was great. The next time I come to Stockholm, I will certainly stay here again."

La casa estuvo durante toda mi estadía impecable y limpia, la ubicación es muy buena, el barrio es muy bonito y debajo hay un centro comercial con tiendas, restaurantes y supermercados. Volvería con mucho gusto"

The best thing is the location, in a lively but quiet district, with cool cafè and clubs nearby, and just 2 min by foot from the metro Maria Torget (2-3 stops from the old city Gamla Stan). I definitly recommend it!"
299154,19511107,2014-09-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Daniel war wirklich sehr freundlich, er gab sich Mühe, dass wir sogar früher in das Appartment gehen konnten, da wir schon so früh angekommen waren.
Das Appartment aber, ist zwar sehr gut gelegen und gemütlich aber für 4 Personnen fast ein wenig zu klein."
916806,89090090,2016-07-26T00:00:00.000Z,"we had a pleasant stay and enjoyed it. We have never met Mansour but during the e-mail conversations he was very kind and helpful and we could find the apartment easily with his description. 
The panoramic view was very beautiful but unfortunately just from the apartment above our apartment. 
The toilet was constantly losing water and that caused the drain pump to work also during the night we could`t sleep well because the drain pump was very noisy."

242188,59605166,2016-01-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia is a very kind host, and will explain you every possible connection of the public transportation in Stockholm! The neighbourhood is well connected and a 5min walk to all the hip places of Södermalm. I stayed in the single room, in which I felt very cozy and at home. Seeing it being all cold and snowy outside it was hard to leave the room, but you can easily cuddle up here with a book and a cup of tea if thats what you feel like :)"
900043,117287022,2016-12-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Le rapport qualité-prix est bon, la situation de l’appartement est très pratique (très proche de la station de métro Hornstull, petits restaurants autour la place)/ Nous n'avons pas rencontré Annelie. Mais elle nous a laissé des cartes de Stockholm et des dépliants sur les endroits à voir. Quelques inconvénients : matelas sur le sol, vieux appareils de cuisine et pas d’ouverture de fenêtre possible."
608672,93404249,2016-08-12T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed at Karl's flat during two nights. It was a really nice stay. He was very welcoming and he gave us a lot of good indications for our short stay. The place was really clean, everything that we could need was there. It's close to central station and to the old city so if you don't want to take the metro during your stay this is the place to be.
We would go there again if we get the chance to go again in Stockholm.
Thank you for everything Karl. :)
Ps: for the French people, malgré ce que peut dire Karl, il parle très très bien français !"

The flat is clean and located perfectly close to different metro stations and walking distance to restaurants and shops all over. Only about 10 minute walk to the old Town and to the fotografic museum, which is worth a visit! I'd recommend this flat and Barb as a host any time!"
533880,13966970,2014-06-09T00:00:00.000Z,Jarl is extremely nice and helpful. The apartment is located in a very centrally located area with tree lined boulevards and upscale shops. It was easy to get around using the underground train. We stayed in one room in Jarl's apartment. We shared the bathroom and kitchen with Jarl and either his kids or another airbnb guest. Jarl also provided breakfast which was a pleasant surprise.
242188,258369963,2018-04-29T00:00:00.000Z,"The flat is located on the 5th floor of an apartment building that has an elevator.  The room is very quiet and clean linen and towels are provided.  Additionally, there is a lock on the door.  There is also a common area that is shared with guests from the 3 other bedrooms which contains two sofas and two chairs, as well as a fridge, a microwave, a kettle and kitchen dishware.  

The owner is very personable and will provide a lot of information on Stockholm. 

Good location, walkable distance to Gamla Stan and downtown (approx 20 min) but if you don’t care to walk, there is always the subway which is pretty close.

Good stay!"

608672,90260063,2016-07-31T00:00:00.000Z,"Karl was available prior to arrive for any questions and very attentive to email if I had any questions during my stay. The room itself is completely private and provides a really nice experience. It is also in the most beautiful part of town and couldn't be more centrally located. Fantastic place to stay. At the beginning of the stay, Karl mentioned he is in the process of securing a permit to install a real shower cab. As it stands the shower situation is quite a hassle. Due to a ineffective shower curtain and water barrier, water truly goes all over the bathroom floor. Once the shower cab is installed, this listing will be flawless."
1170027,40421861,2015-07-31T00:00:00.000Z,"We spent a month at Diana's apartment and it was a great experience.  Both Diana and her father Avi were gracious, helpful hosts.  The location of the apartment is in a suburb of Stockholm, quiet, and in a charming park-like setting, with lots of families and children.  Once we figured out the shortcut, it's only a few minutes walk to the metro station.  The metro is on a street filled with shops, including 3 supermarkets, a produce market, a couple of restaurants and cafes.  From there, it's a direct 20-minute metro ride into central Stockholm, so it was very convenient.  However, when we first arrived it was very difficult to find the apartment since the layout of the buildings is quite confusing.
In addition to a comfortable single bed and an equally comfortable sofabed, the apartment is nicely furnished, including the very pleasant balcony overlooking the trees.  The kitchen was extremely well-equipped with everything we needed to make virtually all our meals, and Diana left a great deal of food for us.  The Internet worked perfectly.  There is a washer and dryer available a few buildings away and you can schedule a time slot in advance which was helpful.  Overall, we enjoyed our Stockholm Airbnb experience very much."

Sad to say, but we were indisposed and could not use Maud's accommodation this time. But we will definitely visit Maud ahead. Communication with Maud has worked very well and we look forward to meeting her personally."

There were two points of access to public transportation (tunnelbana and bus), both about 5-8 minutes walk from the apartment, as well as a few restaurants and grocery stores.

I would definitely recommend staying with her for anybody thinking about visiting Stockholm."

He met us at the flat and was very nice and personable, showed us around and sent us an e-mail with idea's of what to do in the neighborhood and the city. The flat is just as pictured, neat tidy and and full of simple charm. Slept three in the room very comfortably. A grocery store and the bus stop to the city are right out the front door. Never took more than 15 minutes to get to our destination from Carl's space. We really loved our stay and would recommend it to anyone we knew traveling to Stockholm. Thanks again Carl!"
723539,13734757,2014-06-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Mathias was at the apartment when I arrived with my mother and her friend. The flat is at a great location, and easy access everywhere. There is no wifi but a cable connection. There were three of us (adults) staying in the apartment, whereas he only had two single blankets and blanket covers. When asked about it the next day and whether extra one could be arranged, we got quite a rude response saying that there aren't any extras, and no one has ever requested for extra duvets, and he has had plenty of guests. As a result, one of us slept under a towel under (we switched each night), two others using the (single!) duvets. 

Otherwise is very nice and clean, but I would not stay there again. This is the first time I've never had even a slightly negative experience renting a flat through Airbnb."
