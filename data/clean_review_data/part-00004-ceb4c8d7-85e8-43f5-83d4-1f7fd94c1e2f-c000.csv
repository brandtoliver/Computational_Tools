She is located in a nice area of Soldermalm and is close to many shops and cafes. I highly recommend Mallika's home to others."
145320,343687167,2018-11-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Kim is a wonderful host, and welcomes you into her home.  It is also very central to whatever you might want to do in Stockholm.  We really enjoyed our stay!"
299154,42519798,2015-08-14T00:00:00.000Z,Very well located in beautiful Södermalm. For our 4-headed family it was very small though - especially since we had a lot of luggage. Good luck the weather was nice so we could use the balcony and spend most of the time outside. Sleeping on bed and sofa was very comfortable and the kids loved the huge TV! ;)
283446,33156976,2015-05-25T00:00:00.000Z,"My friend and I stayed for three days at Vidhatri’s house and had a fantastic time. Vidhatri and her husband, Bala, are lovely warm people :) They helped us from the start before we came to Sweden, advising us on which tickets to buy at the airport and directions.
 
On arrival we were given homemade pancakes and waffles, and each morning we were given delicious homemade food at whatever time we woke up. We especially loved our Indian breakfast! Their daughter helped us decide which places to visit, and we were made to feel so welcome it felt like home.

The room is large and spacious – definitely big enough for two people – and the bed is so comfortable! Metro is a 2 minute walk away, and the all night metros at the weekend made this a convenient place close to the centre, but also quiet enough to get a good night’s sleep. The room is exactly as the description says. 

Thank you so much for having us! We loved Sweden and hope to see you again soon. Would definitely stay here again and recommend."

242188,132010277,2017-02-15T00:00:00.000Z,I was in Stockholm for a conference and some sightseeing and Lidia's place was perfect for this.  Lidia was a fantastic host and communication was excellent.

338470,1184445,2012-04-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Gustaf's place was in prime location for my trip to sweden's capital.   centrally located, beautiful neighborhood, short little walk from the water, 4 minute walk to the metro, 2 stops away from Tcentral, big windows, comfy bed, and so much more.  location wise, this place was a gem to stay at.  Thanks again Gustaf."
155685,1325209,2012-05-22T00:00:00.000Z,"What a wonderful place! This apartment is located directly on the water with a perfect bakery and restaurant directly in the house. A park, grocery store and many nice cafes and bars within minutes of walk... no need to go downtown ;) seriously: this place has good karma, a very helpful host and public transportation within 3 minutes of walk."
608672,63135537,2016-02-20T00:00:00.000Z,We had an awesome stay for three days in Karl's little apartment. It's small but very cozy and situated perfectly. We really enjoyed our stay.
700113,193412640,2017-09-13T00:00:00.000Z,Beautiful place. Very secure and organised. The host is cooperative and stayed in touch even with late evening checkin. Plenty of good restaurants at walkable distance. Recommended for sure.
1244657,206184220,2017-10-24T00:00:00.000Z,"I loved this place inside out. 
Central, very clean, amazing host and extremely friendly environment. 
I felt very comfortable and at home. 
Nic and Usha have a great taste with every touch in this apartment. 
Usha is a welcoming warm person. 
Haven't met Nic as he was in Berlin but I can tell he's a lovely person. 
The bedroom is spacious, very clean and warm enough. 
The bathroom is very clean too. 
The apartment is in a very central area, its between the old city and Sodermalm center with great access to all sorts of public transportation. 
Thank u Nic & Usha and hope to see you again soon."
164448,267885931,2018-05-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Li was a spectacular host. She sat down and gave us a wonderful overview of the city and the \"must sees\". The space is large and bright, with lots of amenities. It's very close to trains, but a nice 30 min walk to Old Towne."
873383,138239071,2017-03-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Isabelle is a lovely host and a nice person!

1128990,510550064,2019-08-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Great location and good value. Sense that we were very much in someone else’s place which we haven’t done much before. Felt important to keep to the guidelines. Note single beds, may not suit a couple."
900043,53545168,2015-11-09T00:00:00.000Z,"We never met Annelie but she left us the key under the mat and left us very clear instructions on how to find the building and get into the apartment. The main room was as described although there was not a sitting table by the kitchen as it appears to be in the picture. Everything is pretty much in the same room, beds and the sitting table. The apartment was perfect though for us two, and the location was  excellent! Close to supermarkets, bars and a 2 minute walk from the subway station. I would definitely recommend!"

1261445,34187665,2015-06-06T00:00:00.000Z,"This was a lovely apartment, well situated in Sodermalm. Marie-Louise was the perfect host and responded to all e mails quickly. She and her daughter met us at the apartment and made us feel really welcome and had provided fresh fruit and flowers and other grocery basics which as greatly appreciated.

The property is indeed a 3 minute walk to the Metro and shops and about 20 minutes to the Old Town.

Highly recommended - Many thanks"

647314,7375667,2013-09-17T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a lovely stay at the beautiful apartment of Mallika and very much enjoyed the city of Stockholm this way. It's very centrally located, easy to walk or catch the metro which is so close. The apartment is very cosy and colourfull and our host gave us some nice tips for places to visit or get a nice breakfast! I'd recommend it for sure!"
1124388,55910978,2015-12-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Carl is an excellent host, very welcoming. We were 3 in his lovely apartment, it was perfect for 3 days. Thank's a lot!"

581243,142044166,2017-04-06T00:00:00.000Z,A quiet and amazing stay.  There are shops all around and close to public transit as well.  The place was warm and clean.
954832,291566507,2018-07-16T00:00:00.000Z,"We enjoyed our stay in Mikael’s studio. The place was clean, and close to everywhere we wanted to go and see. Mikael was very prompt with questions, and was easy to get a hold of. He also provided great suggestions on what to do/where to eat, etc. We were only able to stay one night, and wished we could have stayed longer. I would not hesitate to stay there again."
776155,42243639,2015-08-12T00:00:00.000Z,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1248490,88808432,2016-07-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Thank you Maria, for having us in your wonderful apartment. Everything was exactly as described and all was spotlessly clean. We loved the views on all sides (the church at night!) and the neighborhood is fantastic! Good supermarket, cafés and playgrounds nearby and quick access to downtown by buss. Communication was easy and Maria responded quickly and adequately to our questions. 
Thanks!"
242188,104926634,2016-09-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia is a most charming lady and very welcoming & friendly.  The place was absolutely to the description,  plenty of space and very clean.  She was very quick & easy to communicate with.
The location is great, very quiet and close to both public transport and also to some great bars and restaurants. I had a really nice walk into town, 15 min to the old town and another 5 min to the city."
1096827,449224909,2019-05-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Really nice house... near the station, minutes from the central... really clean... Anita is a great host, really recommend her place."
1234960,240551244,2018-03-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Wonderful house, great communication and assistance by the host - Jacob.

Very good location, 5-10mins walk from Svedmyra metro station. 

Very homely and also super close to a very nice supermarket!"

873383,44481457,2015-08-26T00:00:00.000Z,It was a great experience.  Isabelle gave me recommendations and was a very kind host. Dan is excellent as well.  You won't be disappointed staying with them!
873383,90666526,2016-08-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Isabelle was very accommodating and thoughtful. The room is spacious, and the neighborhood is calm. 
The apartment is located far from Stockholm, but public transportation makes the trip easy. 
If you are attending an event at Stockholmsmässen, then the room is perfect as you can follow a calm, quiet path to arrive at the venue."
770995,313324407,2018-08-25T00:00:00.000Z,"The appartment is well located, near a subway station, a supermarket. 
It's calm, decorated with great taste and very convenient with three rooms and a kitchen well equiped.
I highly recommend it as Peter is a very pleasant host and always ready to answer our questions."
1137050,9562309,2014-01-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Gabriel is a great host and his flat is nice. He was there to explain everything and to provide good advices for Stockholm. The localization is good with the bus station and two bars :-) in the same street. The metro station is not far away.
The apartment is exactly like the pictures with this Artist style. Everything was ready for us : bed, room available in the wardrobe... We had  wifi connection. 
We enjoyed our stay here!"
533880,3573040,2013-02-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Jarl was friendly, courteous, and filled with good information about getting around Stockholm.  The location is not right in Central Stockholm, but it is quiet and well within city limits.  It is in walking distance to Djurgården where the Vasa Museum, Skansen, and other tourist sites are located.  Breakfast was wonderful, and I would stay there again very easily!"
1041103,4534392,2013-05-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Beautiful, large apartment in a lovely neighborhood. Karoline welcomed us with a well-stocked refrigerator and other goodies and gave us recommendations for local eateries and shops. The apartment is only a few metro stops from Stockholm's T-Centralen, the main station, so it is very conveniently located. The three bedrooms gave us plenty of space (our three grown sons traveled with us) and having the kitchen saved us a lot of money by not having to eat out every meal. (Tip: If you DO want to eat out close to the apartment one night, try JJ's to Go, a faulous Thai place with delicious food--very popular with the locals, as well.). Karoline has a lovely apartment, and the easy access to central Stockholm makes it a perfect place to come \"home\" to after a busy day of sight-seeing and shopping. Highly recommended. We will definitely stay here again on our next visit to beautiful Stockholm. Thanks, Karoline, for making us feel so very welcome!"
1261445,54026578,2015-11-15T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment was very nice and cosy, and the location was perfect. The neighbourhood was quiet and with some good next-door restaurants. Marie-Louise and her daughter were very nice and helpful."
647314,52903111,2015-11-02T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a good stay at Malika home. The neighborhood and nice, cozy coffee shops and close to everything you want to see in Stockholm. The room was nice and bright like the picture. The rest of the house is a bit dark. Malika has a really nice cat. In the bed you roll toward each other, so perfect for a romantic stay."
510398,333490368,2018-10-07T00:00:00.000Z,Great location. Easy to get to. Quick responses from the host.
1244657,128730049,2017-01-27T00:00:00.000Z,Great location! Nic and Usha are very kind and helped me a lot during my brief stay with them. Real easy going people  with a nice home with pretty much everything you need (in the house and in the close vicinity). Would definitely recommend!
723539,104001888,2016-09-25T00:00:00.000Z,Bra värd och boende.
757320,124645535,2017-01-02T00:00:00.000Z,Barb was an excellent host : very kind and helpful. She welcomed us very well ! We recommend her flat for its location and good accommodations. Thanks a lot !
242188,7568986,2013-09-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Excellent. Great value for money. Lidia is a great host, very friendly and helpful. The place was comfortable with nice decoration giving it overall a nice and cosy feel. Very convenient location with excellent public transport services."
897730,296718207,2018-07-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Meget fint beliggende lejlighed i en tjekket, klippefyldt, højtbeliggende del af byen. Lejligheden er personligt og stilfuldt indrettet. Der er en fantastisk udsigt over fjorden og byen fra altan og køkken. Gennemført og velholdt bygning, nem og hurtig kontakt. En virkelig god base for et Stockholmbesøg."
1271843,525853444,2019-09-08T00:00:00.000Z,André's kind and friendly he is super Host and definitely I hope stay at has house every-time I come here
145320,231273225,2018-01-31T00:00:00.000Z,"I would definitely recommend Kim's place for anyone wanting to stay near the city in a nice comfortable place. Close to the subway, 3 stops from the Central station, close to shopping markets. Kim provided good instructions and was very quick to respond to emails. She also gave some recommendations of things to do in the area, can't comment on that however as I was too busy to actually check them out.

What to expect: Very cosy interior, had a warm feeling that you can't get just anywhere. Didn't feel like I was staying in an AirBNB, felt like being in a home."
610948,206349517,2017-10-25T00:00:00.000Z,"I spent a month in Lina's flat and could not have been happier. If anything, it was even nicer than in the pictures. Lina was a pleasure to communicate with and did everything she could to ensure that I had a productive and happy stay. I am most grateful to her. Thank you, Lina!"
819676,157234488,2017-06-03T00:00:00.000Z,"I would highly recommend Andy & Vannie as excellent hosts - friendly, hospitable, knowledgeable - and eager to make our stay pleasant.  The room was small but adequate.  The neighborhood was centrally located, and we were able to walk to everything from there.  Andy was especially helpful in getting us to our cruise ship when we were unable to get a taxi.  Overall, we were quite satisfied."
700113,12356147,2014-04-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Ilona was an amazing host.
The place was better than described, we loved being there, Ilona has a great system where the apartment is fully private and in the middle of the city with all you need to cook food."
1182616,30423579,2015-04-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Peter maintained constant contact with me via the Airbnb app to ensure that everything went smoothly. Unfortunately, our schedules conflicted and we never actually met one another.

Regardless, his place was pretty well kept. There were two other rooms, both occupied by other tourists (all of which were really friendly!)

The room itself was extremely spacious and very comfortable. The location was very close to a major transit station, so it was very easy to get around.

Thanks for having us!"
700113,189334571,2017-09-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Ilona is a fabulous host and it was a pleasure meeting her and staying in her lovely little apartment. It was fully equipped and well located next to a sunny park in a part of Stockholm I personally hadn't known before, but which was very accessible to the center of town. Would highly recommend it and gladly stay there again."
1212891,437744257,2019-04-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice room in a good location near the metro. Maud is a perfect host - you'll find everything you need. Cleanness, cozy and stylish place. The cat lives his own private life, so don't worry about annoying. Thanks, Maud for your hospitality."
581243,304751840,2018-08-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Great location, very clean space, and Edwin is a wonderful host!"
1244657,98264022,2016-08-30T00:00:00.000Z,"My stay with Nic and Usha was fantastic. The couple was really friendly and their place is clean, neat and very near to all the attractions. We got time for a little chat during my last night and it was definitely an enjoyable stay. Would definitely be back again on my next work trip :)"
700113,18011727,2014-08-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Lovely, quiet place with a nice balcony in a nice and central part of town. Ilona was helpful and friendly. Would recommend to those travelling to Stockholm for work or leisure."
1182616,9362837,2013-12-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Peter's place is just perfect to explore Stockholm!
We spent a couple of days and even though we never met Peter in person I can say that he is a really great host. The appartment is very clean and well equipped. We even got a little christmas present! :)
I would definately recommend it!"
700113,76248877,2016-05-25T00:00:00.000Z,"This studio was perfect for my short business trip to  Stockholm. It was located near public transport and local amenities (supermarkets, restaurants etc) and 20 minutes walk from the centre of Stockholm. 

The studio is simply decorated but had everything I needed. The balcony was a welcome extra space on a warm evening overlooking the park. The fact that the location is only 50 metres from an outdoor swimming pool was an added bonus, enabling an early morning swim before work! 

Ilona Margareta was friendly and welcoming on arrival. It was nice knowing she lived so close to the studio, but our paths didn't cross until I left 2 days later."
608672,106852580,2016-10-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Karl received us upon our arrival and gave us a very good orientation of Stockholm and the popular sights. He also gave us a map with the popular sights marked out.

As we rented a car during our stay, Karl also patiently brought us around the neighbourhood to explain how the parking system works in Stockholm and where we can park, as we do not understand the Swedish language. 

We were intrigued by how the lift system works in the old building - something we don't have in our country anymore!

As we had 2 huge luggages, the space was a big tight for us. However, the location of the apartment made up for everything!! the shopping district was nearby - probably just 2 streets away.

 Karl was a great host and we had a great experience!"
206221,186743457,2017-08-25T00:00:00.000Z,"I stayed 3 days in Elisabeth's apartment, and everything was perfect! The room, as the whole apartment, is very beautiful and cozy. The apartment is situated in a very elegant district, which is close to the city center (if you like to walk, it is even possible not to use the metro to get to the city center). There are a lot of fashionable cafes and shops near. There are also some supermarkets nearby. The closest one is a 5 minutes walk.  
I really enjoyed the breakfasts Elisabeth prepared every morning! They were tasty, abundant and even elegantly served on the table! 
It was a pleasure to talk to Elisabeth while having breakfast or in the evening. She is a very nice and interesting person to talk to. She also gave me valuable advice on how to get to some places of interest. 
She treated me so well, so if I am back to Stockholm, I would definitely choose to stay in Elisabeth's apartment again!"
1054406,115626229,2016-11-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Superbe maison ! On y est resté 2 mois ! 
À 15min à pied du métro ou 4 min en bus !
À 30min du centre en métro parfait
Maison confortable 

Je conseil pour les petits séjours 6-7 personnes Max et pour les longs séjours 3-4 Max !

Je recommande cette maison !"
916806,443099870,2019-04-25T00:00:00.000Z,"The house is quite large.
The price is reasonable.
The house is near shopping malls,e.g ikea .
Julia responses us quickly!"
278311,7255148,2013-09-13T00:00:00.000Z,"I liked the big room with hangers for the clothes, the place is very quiet and clean. There is a food store 4 minutes from the appartment. Linnéa and her friends give useful advices to visit the best places in Stockholm."
1244657,284843844,2018-07-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Ich verbrachte drei sehr angenehme Tage bei Nic und Usha. Nic habe ich nicht persönlich kennengelernt, Usha war aber immer überaus freundlich und hilfsbereit! Die Lage der Wohnung ist phänomenal. Ich würde wieder hier übernachten!
Zu beachten bei langen schwedischen Sommertagen: Das Zimmer hat keine Vorhänge."
283446,2808533,2012-11-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Vidhatri and her family are excellent host. During our stay of 2 nights, they treated us family member. We had long chats with them and enjoyed their fresh home cooked, Indian vegetarian food. Their apartment is at throw of stone from last stop of T station (Akalla). They helped us with information on city, best use of T service and airport transportation.

We recommend their apartment by airbnb members and we will surly use their facility, whenever we are in Stockholm. we wish them all the best."
1212891,340208081,2018-10-23T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed at Maud's for a very brief time, as Stockholm was just a stop before our main trip, but we loved it there! She was super nice, hospitable and warmhearted and Sammy (the cat) was just sooo adorable!! Maud wrote us a detailed and very, very helpful directions on how to find the address before we landed at Sweden, which made it a lot easier. The (purple) room is so cozy and has everything needed. We also had our own personal space in almost every part of the home. The apartment itself is very close to the subway station, just about 5 minutes by foot.  
We left early in the morning, so I couldn't say goodbye properly so I will just write here - thank you for such a nice first airbnb experience!"
608672,17147318,2014-08-08T00:00:00.000Z,"We found this a great location - very central but a quiet and attractive neighbourhood. We liked the old, charming, and well maintained Stockholm building that the apartment is in. The main room is a good size. Kitchen and bathroom are small but ok for a short stay.

The bathroom was fine, but do not expect serious luxury. There is a kitchen included as well, with cook-plates and a microwave. The owner was very friendly and showed us some nice places to go on the map."

1244657,181154461,2017-08-12T00:00:00.000Z,"La vivienda se encuentra muy céntrica. A un paso de la parte vieja. La casa es amplia, con techos altos. El único inconveniente es que no tiene persianas ni cortina y en verano amanece muy pronto y entra luz. Ellos son muy amables. En la descripción del anuncio ponía bed & breakfast pero no entra el desayuno."
299154,8985685,2013-11-30T00:00:00.000Z,Great small apartment in happening neighborhood. Daniel stayed to greet us even though our plane was 3 hours late. He has another house in Sweden so the place is private. He is a very thorough host. The couch/ bed works great for a second person
556363,64607103,2016-03-06T00:00:00.000Z,"The appartment was spacious and clean.
Our stay was only 4 days but very nice.

Une magnifique terrasse avec une vue sur la baltique. Une plage à 15mn à pied, des centres commerciaux, la zone d'Ikea Kungens à une station de bus. L'appartement est très fonctionnel, une adresse à retenir pour un super séjour à Stockolm. A conseiller sans modération !!"

723539,31040529,2015-05-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Mathias' apartment is in an excellent neighborhood in Stockholm. It is a nice mix of residential and commercial within easy walking distance of major sights.  The apartment is as pictured in the photos online; it is cozy and comfortable, and it is very quiet at night.  Mathias provided us with some helpful literature about places to visit in Stockholm as well as recommended a local yoga studio and restaurants.  We thought is was an excellent place to say in Stockholm."
541875,306253611,2018-08-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Great location. So easy to get downtown. It took about 15 minutes to walk or about 2 stops on the train which is right outside of the apartment. For being so close to downtown it was surprisingly quiet. Martin was a great host. Accommodating and easy to contact. Oh, don’t forget to go to the Valhalla bakery. It’s about a 5 minute walk and oh so delicious!"
556363,91380472,2016-08-05T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment is in a great location and easy to get to from the airport by bus. There are 2 bedrooms, one with a large double bed and another one with 2 single beds. As we were 6, one of us had to sleep on the couch which was OK because we were only there for a few days but the apartment was really small for 6. The apartment was really lovely, but there wasn't any storage for clothes. 
There is plenty of restaurants and bars  down the building, and the subway is in front of the apartment. 
However some parts of the apartment were dirty (hoven and dust below beds). 
Perfect for 4 people"

High-ceilinged, light and airy, it was perfectly located (there's a bus stop right outside where they could take bus no 66 to and from) with a lovely view. Their grandson (my 2-year old son) enjoyed staying over too as it's a great apartment for kids. They also really appreciated the flexibility Calle showed in adjusting both check in and check out time to correspond with their flights. The pictures do not do the apartment justice, it looks even better and larger in  real life! Would definitely stay here again."

It's not in the typical city centre but is close to a metro station that we'll bring you within minutes to old city. It's just great to have a nature break after long day sightseing. 
As a host she is very kind, she provided with lots of tips and came to the bus stop to wait for us.
I would recommend it to anyone and would definetely repeat when I'm back."

The apartment is comfortable, extremely safe and in a great location close to vasastan and ostermalm. 

Across the road is a shopping centre with everything you need from food to international adapters, not to mention the metro access is through the shopping centre also!

I would highly recommend staying in Mikaels apartment it has all you need for a comfortable stay!"

581243,432870607,2019-04-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin's flat is very central, just above a metro station and adjacent to bus and tram services - therefore an excellent location to explore the city of Stockholm if you purchase a transport pass for the duration of your stay.  Edwin was friendly and helpful and stayed out of the way, making his flat available for us to use.  It is very clean and well provided for and we enjoyed our stay."
1271843,155513955,2017-05-28T00:00:00.000Z,"it is in a very fun and lively neighborhood, with amazing views over Stockholm (5-7 minute walk). It is walkable into the Old Town and the City , but it is also just a one-minute to the Metro, which is very convenient."
700113,4799355,2013-05-27T00:00:00.000Z,Ilona is the perfect hostess.  Her little studio is the perfect place to stay in Stockholm.  Easy access to public transit to anywhere in the city.  She has equipped the studio with every convenience required. The spacious main room opens onto a tiny sundeck with table and chairs affording a wonderful view of the park across the street making it perfect for meals and relaxing.  We look forward to returning to this studio in the center of Stockholm.   G&B
1124388,410419720,2019-02-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Carl was a wonderful host. He responded quickly and in detail to all questions. On the day of arrival, he came to meet us at the bus stop despite the fact that we arrived at midnight. He showed us around and made sure that we had everything we needed.
The flat is in an ideal location, walkable to the city centre on a fine day or easily accessible by bus in the snowy weather we experienced. The area is perfect for travellers with a 7/11 opposite the flat, nearby restaurants and bars and great links to transport.
The flat itself is ideal for everyone's needs. Carl has made it feel lovely and homely. All of the home comforts are there and his vast collection of books, vinyls and pictures on the wall give an overall sophisticated feel to the place. We enjoyed our experience immensely and look forward to visiting again soon!"
1137050,5216787,2013-06-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Our stay at Gabriel's appartment in Stockholm was really nice.

Eso sí, llevad algo para cubriros los ojos porque hay ventanas hasta en el techo! Sino a la que salga el sol os despertareis. La única pega que le pondría es la cama... es bastante blandita."
755843,112852051,2016-11-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Pär was a very friendly host. I was traveling with 2 other friends and he gave us some very good advice about the city.

628555,224481218,2018-01-03T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment of Anna was really nice with a lot of little things in it to make it cosy. The apartment was really clean (maybe good to know for neat freaks is that a cleaning service had cleaned the apartment). 
The apartment is big enough for two persons to stay at and has everything if you want to have breakfast there. 
If you like (really) soft and big mattresses, this is a nice place to stay for you. In summertime I could recommend to take a sleeping mask with you, since there is a opening in the bedroom. 
The location of the apartment is out of the city centre, but if you, like us, do not spend much time in the apartment there is a metro station 12 minutes walking distance, so it's pretty convenient (also the metros go all through the night)."
700113,52507884,2015-10-30T00:00:00.000Z,"I have booked the same apartment two times in two weeks (first five days and then three more days) because Ilona is a very helpful person, she is really nice and helps a lot if you need it. The apartment is ideal for one person who wants to be at the center of Stockholm. It has a very good connection with Tunnelbana and busses, also very clean and  full equipped kitchen."
164448,508786382,2019-08-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Li was amazing!  The space is very comfortable and spacious, and in a fantastic location (walking distance to areas with restaurants / bars / shopping in Södermalm, and right next to a train station with easy access to the whole city).  

Even more importantly, though, Li is a lovely host and extremely helpful with local tips, maps, and guides.  When we arrived, Li brewed us a cup of coffee and sat down with us for a quick summary of what to do in Stockholm.  She made us feel very welcome, and gave us great suggestions for what to do with our time in the city.

Can’t recommend enough!"

164448,28452541,2015-03-23T00:00:00.000Z,Lidia was absolutely wonderful! She gave us all the details on Stockholm. She told us about the popular sites and was able to explain the best way to get around. She even gave us some maps so we could find all these phenomenal places! Stockholm was great and the place where Lidia is staying is in an incredible place. Right in the middle of the popular area in Stockholm.
299154,18400455,2014-08-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Daniel was so welcoming and explained the layout of the place and how everything worked. He had a folder in English, as a backup plus we had his phone #if needed.
The location was great and area was accurately described on website. The apartment was very small but adequate. The bed was very comfy."
819676,290301330,2018-07-14T00:00:00.000Z,I had a wonderful stay at Andy's flat. Andy is extremely friendly. He let me check in early to leave my bags. He even offered me a glass of wine. The private bathroom across the corridor is extremely convenient. I highly recommend his place.

1144069,71291522,2016-04-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Thanks Jon for a super comfortable and relaxed stay in your home!!  

Jon's apartment was immaculately clean, light and warm and really comfortable with cool art work.   It was very close to the underground station and we felt really safe walking around late at night also.   Good hot shower with lots of water too!

Excellent host who met us at the apartment and gave advice on any topic we had. 

He arranged a VERY comfortable double airbed for us also so my friend and I didn't need to share the double bed.  

I loved my stay here because it felt like a proper home and I lived a little bit of a Scandinavian life for a weekend.

Thanks for everything

Kate"

1182616,44886327,2015-08-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Ich habe Peter erst bei meiner Abreise persönlich getroffen. Unser Kontakt war zuvor über SMS. Peter ist ein netter Typ. Er hatte in der Woche, in der wir da waren, wohl viel zu tun.
Angesichts dessen, dass er von der Vermietung der Wohnung lebt, hätte ich mir gewünscht, dass er öfter mal nach dem Rechten schaut, was die Sauberkeit des Bades und der Gemeinschaftsräume anbelangt."
903577,74421675,2016-05-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Now, I am not sure whether Jeanette will rent out her room again in the future - and probably not at Eurovision rates :) - but I will still take the chance to be the first one ever to leave a review!     

It was a wonderful stay without any problems - Jeanette is a really nice person, friendly and helpful; and her home is a cosy place.
We both happened to be involved into the Eurovision Festival that week, and have had some very nice conversations together.     

The room is part of an apartment on the ground-floor of a big house, in a residential community. It has got everything it needs: a very comfortable bed, enough light, a big commode to store our  things. The apartment itself is big, neat and well-equipped - a proper family home.     

The location, even though slightly off the centre, is actually ideal - it is just next to a city-train station, on the central line. So, it takes 20 min door-to-door to get from the house to the city-centre. And it is a lovely, calm area, with a park and a supermarket.
If you attend any event/concert in one of the Globe Arenas - they are walking distance (15 min) from the house. Then, no better position than this one.     

I say - Tack, Jeanette!  for making my stay at this festival an enjoyable one!  Will get in touch if I come around Stockholm again!

He not only left us food for breakfast but also dropped off extra bread and things for lunch on our second day there.  Jacob answered messages very quickly and was available on his phone whenever we needed.  The house was perfect for our 6 people with a great location only a 5 minute walk from subway, sauna for after long days of walking and comfortable for sleeping.  I would highly recommend Jacob and his place for anyone going to Stockholm and would definitely stay here when we return."

The studio is in an amazing location - very close to public transportation and an easy walk to see the waterfront. Annika made the check-in process so easy and she was so sweet in reminding me to bring an eyemask since there are such long hours of sunlight during the summer in Stockholm. The bathroom is very spacious and there are shower curtains so that the entire bathroom doesn't get wet. She is also very close to my favorite bakery - Bageri Petrus! There are also multiple grocery stores nearby and her kitchen is fully stocked in case you want to make a meal at home.

He was really accommodating and showed us where to go, what to do, and got us into the best bars/clubs and restaurants. The flat was perfect for what we needed with a super comfy bed. Anytime we go back to Stockholm now we will definitely be staying with Andre! HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
819676,120873539,2016-12-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Andy and Vannie were fantastic hosts; their home is incredibly beautiful!  The room would've been cozy for two people, but it was very lovely and the bed very comfortable.  The private bathroom was very nice as well!

Andy & Vannie were very communicable and made the arrival process very easy.  The location is really tough to beat, only about a 1 min walk from the subway, and in a very hip part of town.  Would love to stay again when I return to Stockholm!"
795354,254776792,2018-04-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Muy bonito apartamento! cercano a cafés, supermercados y metro. Estaba por trabajo y podía ir caminando al lugar del evento.

It is close to the metro and within walking distance to the city center - making it a great option for anyone looking to be close while enjoying quiet surroundings. Gabriella is also easy to work with and gave great recommendations for local eats. I would highly recommend her flat to friends and family, and would stay there again when next in Stockholm!"
608672,100516447,2016-09-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Die Lage des Appartements ist super central. Wer gern zu Fuss unterwegs ist erreicht alles ohne die Bahn zu benutzen. Das Haus in dem die Wohnung ist gefällt mir sehr gut. Es war sauber und ordentlich. Der Kontakt zu Karl war freundlich und hilfsbereit. Die Waschmaschine konnte ohne Probleme verwendet werden. Es ist etwas hellhörig. Die Bettmatratze ist für mich persönlich schon etwas zu weich eingelegen. Die Küche eignet sich wirklich nur für kleine unkomplizierte Snacks, da im Bad abgewaschen werden muss und ein Esstisch fehlt. Würde die Unterkunft wieder buchen. Vielen Dank."
795354,21810834,2014-10-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Had a great stay at Gustav's place!  Communication was easy, and everything went smoothly.  Plus he's a great guy.

819676,96975138,2016-08-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Great place. The room was newly remodeled and everything was very clean. The common areas in the apartment are spacious and new as well. 
Andy and Vannie do a great job with finishing touches like a setup to make coffee/tea in the room, etc.
But the most important thing to me is the awesome location. Just a two minute walk to Slussen T station, which means you can get anywhere quickly, and the neighborhood itself is the hip part of Stockholm, on Götsbacken overlooking Sofo."
757320,20860677,2014-10-06T00:00:00.000Z,Perfect location to explore the city. Barb was very kind and gentle. The flat was clean and lovely. Everything I needed for the stay provided.

1170669,471396085,2019-06-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Jennie's place is an oasis if you need down time from constantly traveling. About a 10-15 minute walk from the train station, you get to see suburban Swedish life in action around you. Jennie was nice, quick to respond, and has neighbors that are willing to answer any questions should you just need to be shown something. We had no trouble finding the place and enjoyed our down time there. I highly recommend this place for a family or larger group!"

845365,67921332,2016-04-01T00:00:00.000Z,I stayed in Michael's apartment for one month. Michael and his wife were very friendly and helping. On my day of arrival Michael's wife Aleza picked me up from the metro station in her car and gave me nice snacks and tea. I enjoyed talking to Michael about various things. He is a very nice and gentle person.  Apartment was very comfortable and well equipped.  It is very nearby to the Bredäng metro station and ICA grocery store (roughly 500 meters).  I used to cook my own food and i have no difficulty.  Over all It was a great experience to stay there.
916806,13507582,2014-05-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice place, very clean and comfortable! Amazing view from the terrace where you can sit with a cup of your morning coffee and dream about something pleasant!"

Area Sodermalm is a great place near the center of Stockholm.
If we will have a trip to Sweden we wish to stay here again."

In addition, the apartment was on the top floor and offered great views. 

The apartment was located in a great neighborhood.  It was two blocks from a street with numerous restaurants and bars. I would definitely stay at Annika's again."

845365,288236565,2018-07-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Michael’s delightfully Bohemian & a bit eccentric, which is what makes AirBnB so much fun!  You get to interact with real people in the local community, not corporate facades. He was quite helpful & an excellent conversationalist. The room is fairly small but comfortable & in easy proximity to a train station and bike paths. Good stay overall!"
299154,32609274,2015-05-19T00:00:00.000Z,Daniels place was awesome.  Very close to public transportation and the located in the cool part of Stockholm.  The place was very clean and well appointed.

Excellent laundry included in tariff.
The unit has a separate entrance, the bedroom/ living room is combined with a desk and 2 chairs. The shower is only just adequate as is the kitchen.
It was very clean, the host was friendly and most obliging"
1212891,13856393,2014-06-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud was very nice and accommodating during our stay in Stockholm.  She told us how to save money on groceries (which was important for us).  Maud is very friendly, as are her two cats.  Her apartment has good access to the metro, and it was pretty convenient from that respect. She was also kind enough to let us leave our luggage there after we had \"checked out\" so that we could continue to explore the city until we needed to board the train for the next leg in our journey."
1204621,347912889,2018-11-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Nettan was a great host, likeable and easy going, she made me feel at home and welcome and was really helpful and sharing. During my stay I almost forgot it was a Air BnB booking and felt like I was a guest!"

We were a group of six and the house suited us very well. 
It was clean and spacious and well equipped.
We enjoyed the garden too and could have happily stayed here without going into Stockholm but we had sightseeing to do.
We would have been happy to stay longer and take advantage of everything the house had to offer."

The room is spacious for two people and the metro, pendeltag and buses are very near. You can go everywhere without any problem and you can reach the centre of the city by bus or by metro in few minutes.
Li can give you some useful advices to visit better the city and she is always ready to talk and help you planning your visit. If you are searching a beautiful spot in Stockholm, you have to choose this flat."

1137050,176457561,2017-07-31T00:00:00.000Z,Die Wohnung liegt zentral in Södermalm. Zentral aber nicht im Tourismuszentrum und daher fühlt man sich wie ein Stockholmer. Typische schwedische Wohnung in Stockholmer Wohngegend. Umgeben von trendigen Läden und Lokalen. Einen Besuch wert!

259025,6318332,2013-08-08T00:00:00.000Z,"This is a great, very affordable place to stay in Stockholm. The owner, Ali, has bedrooms on two floors that he rents out. We only met Ali briefly as he was away on holiday himself for most of our stay but he went out of his way to make sure we had everything we need. We were travelling with our 13 month old daughter and he arranged for us to have a cot in our room, which was hugely appreciated!

Guests are allowed to prepare their own breakfast in the kitchen, and also use the microwave. So if anyone wants somewhere they can do a lot of home cooking this might not be ideal. The house is situated within 5 minutes walking distance of Rinkeby T-bana station, when you can catch a train into the centre that takes around 15-20 minutes. There is a small convenience store opposite the house where you can buy a few essential items to makes lunches etc - Ali is happy for you to keep some items in the fridge or freezer."

What characters! Overall we really enjoyed our stay with Maud.
242188,33576900,2015-05-30T00:00:00.000Z,"I stayed two weeks in May in Lydia's airB&B when I was in Stockholm for work. The description was accurate. I stayed in the single room. It is a small room but it was perfect for me. There is also a common room with a little fridge that you can use. The air b&b is really close (2 min walk) to the train station (Stockholm Södra). That was perfect for my work, but it gets you in 2 min in Stockholm central. There are also several grocery shops closeby. When I stayed at Lydias place, several guest came and went. But everyone was very considerate to each other in sharing common place and bathroom and the atmosphere was really pleasant. Most of all, Lydia is very welcoming and very caring host! She had the patience also to have little Swedish conversations with me, and helping me in learning Swedish. When I arrived there was an internet connection problem, but she arranged immediately a way I could still have internet acces. She has also very good knowledge about the sight-seeing places in Stockholm and all the practical arrangments. No doubt I would recommend her and go back!"
647314,241428715,2018-03-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Mallika has an amazing flat. It's in a prime location in Södermalm. Around the corner from the metro, surrounded by cool coffee shops and restaurants, all while maintaining a quiet neighborhood feel. It's only 2 metro stops from Old Town but also close enough to walk, about 30ish min. The flat is also HUGE. Has everything you would need. I regret we didn't stay longer. Highly recommended!"

Da wir 4 Personen sind, war der Platz ziemlich knapp und auch die Schlafsituation mit den Decken war etwas dürftig (2 Duvets). Jedoch spielte dies aufgrund des schönen Wetters keine grosse Rolle. Wir empfehlen diese Wohnung für 2-3 Personen, aber nicht für 4. 
Liebe Grüsse

The flat is quite large, especially for downtown Stockholm, and the Vasastan area is packed with grocery stores, restaurants, bars, and shops. It's very convenient to various forms of public transportation, and I took many walks from there to multiple other areas of downtown. The area is surprisingly quiet, and the flat was quite clean. I'd enjoy staying there again."

The combination of old charm and new style was great, including the old stairway up from the front door. We walked everywhere, including to the Gamla Stan and other touristic sites, and then returned back to this locals neighborhood and had fantastic dinners nearby. On sunny evenings we drank wine on the little deck outside. Ann-Sophie was great at communicating with us and was easily reached when necessary and always helpful.
Thanks Ann-Sophie!"

We were four adults and two small children, and very much enjoyed the space, the balcony, good beds, and the well functioning and up-to-date (not to mention beautiful) kitchen. The flat is peaceful and quiet, located on a calm street. The apartment is very central with all the main attractions of Stockholm walking distance away. Gabriela is a wonderful host, flexible and easy to communicate with - thank you so much for having us!"

Great view too! Thanks again Linda!"

Accueil privilégié par une dame qui est très généreuse avec ses invités. On ne manque de rien chez Lidia, au contraire! L'organisation de l'appartement est parfait pour se reposer; endroit très tranquille, déjeuner copieux. Lidia nous fournit toutes les informations nécessaires pour un séjour optimal (5 jours dans mon cas). Je recommande ce site, à moins que vous vouliez être encore plus près des activités au centre de Stockholm.

Several bus stops nearby make it relatively easy to get into the city. Closer to the apartment, we also enjoyed the playground and lake. The personal touches were also lovely - Thomas offered it let us check in early and stay late to accommodate our travel plans, there were groceries waiting for us in the kitchen, and Madeline lent us puzzles for our son. Definitely recommended!"

Ella siempre me ha ayudado con todas las dudas que haya podido tener y siempre con una sonrisa en su cara. Me ha dado mucha información de Suécia en general y de Estocolmo.
Es una persona muy atenta y agradable que te hace sentir muy bien en su casa.
La ubicación del piso es genial porqué es muy céntrica.
Recomiendo totalmente la estancia en casa de Lídia.

The house was very clean and tidy. 
The room was big enough for us and equipped with fresh towels.
We were a little disappointed about the fact that we were not allowed to use the kitchen for cooking.

Thanks for the host...
Ali was not there during our stay but a friend of him was there to welcome us and check if we needed everything."
259025,740869,2011-11-23T00:00:00.000Z,"The location is not that far as I saw on map. It takes only 16 minutes to the main station by subway. Meanwhile, you will never find such huge and cozy bedroom in the town. Th host Ali is so hospitable. Anyway I'm happy that I made a good choice."
954832,74426427,2016-05-15T00:00:00.000Z,WOW. Our stay was amazing. Mikael is the perfect host. We got lots of Information in advance. The flat is cosy and located brilliantly. We can recommend it for sure!!!

448259,3256403,2013-01-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Ali has turned his home into a small hostel. The house is lovely and clean, there is a separate bathroom/toilet for the guests and Ali is very welcoming, helpful and answers queries quickly.

The only issue is it isn't so convenient to the centre of Stockholm. It is easy to get there but the journey takes some time. It would be better suited to a long term stay.

But other than that. Strongly recommended."

1271843,190089008,2017-09-03T00:00:00.000Z,"We loved every moment of our 6 night stay with André and Camilla. They are super AirBnB hosts and wonderful people.

The apartment is in a great location in Southern, central Stockholm. The metro and a bike station are less than 100m from the front door which is amazingly convenient. The apartment itself is beautiful. One of the comfiest beds I've ever slept in and an incredibly quiet bedroom. The kitchen is well stocked and includes everything you could possibly need. André has done an amazing job making the place feel like home.

As for the hosts - what a lovely couple. We were lucky enough to catch them for dinner on our second night in town. You couldn't ask for more interesting or thoughtful hosts - nothing was too much trouble and communication was excellent from start to finish.

All in all a wonderful experience in one of my favourite cities in the world. Thanks both!

P.s., If you're coming by car there's free on-street parking available just a 30 minute walk or 3 stop metro ride from the apartment in Liljeholmen. We left our car there for 6 days with no problem whatsoever."

The flat is very nice and cosy, comfortable, clean and wellcoming, it felt like home. A real treat after your day in busy Estockholm in summer. The location is good, only 4 metro stops from the city centre, really quick and easy. I would recommend Annika's flat to anybody and I would, certainly, take it again if I go back to Stockholm. Thank you very much, Annika."
647314,513223395,2019-08-19T00:00:00.000Z,"A stunning apartment great access to public transport.

608672,66071989,2016-03-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Karl was extremely welcoming and kind. We arrived at around 1AM and Karl stayed up in order to greet us and show us around the apartment. Although the flat is very small, it is a great and intimate space for 1 or 2 people, like advertised. The bathroom, of course, is inconvenient since there is no separated area for the shower. He did say that it was getting renovated so I do hope that this will be better for future guests."
385701,37278512,2015-07-06T00:00:00.000Z,Familj med 2 vuxna och 5 barn hyrde detta radhus 2 veckor i juni 2015. Allt var kanon! 5 min promenad till tunnelbanestationen Farsta och Farsta centrum med affärer man kan tänkas behöva. Fin parklek nära huset. Bra information och trevligt bemötande från Alex. WI-FI funkade bra! Det var skönt att ha diskmaskin och tvättmaskin i huset. Parkeringsplats finns precis utanför huset. Rekommenderas varmt!

442837,87056475,2016-07-18T00:00:00.000Z,"I had a great stay in Stockholm. The room was small, but clean and exactly as described. I had everything I needed (desk, good Internet connection and a central location). The Tunnelbana stop Liljeholmen (underground metro) was literally across the street and there was also a Lidl store and a big shopping centre just around the corner. I didn't meet Jo as she was travelling herself. However, we were in touch via (Hidden by Airbnb) and on the phone and she made sure that a friend of hers checked me in, which all worked out fine. I also met her mum, who dropped by to see if everything was ok. The flat was very quiet day and night, so perfect after a busy day of sightseeing or attending a conference in the city."
776012,45299914,2015-09-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Majken's apartment is absolutely amazing!
It is in the heart of the old quarter of Stockholm (Gamlastan), in a quiet picturesque street. The apartment has a cosy atmosphere very warm and welcoming. I felt at home right away and the more I stayed the more I loved it. It has been a true unique and great experience for me to live there for a short while. The view from the windows is also really beautiful view on the rooftops of the old city and beyond. The apartment was fully equipped and met all my needs.
I truly recommend this apartment to anyone wanting to experience living in Stockholm's old quarter in an old yet super-convenient and comfortable apartment. It's a true - one of a kind. You couldn't ask for a more authentic Stockholm living experience.
Since it's located in the heart of Stockholm, you have many restaurants, supermarkets, metro station, all in a very short walking distance. Also, the most beautiful attractions of Stockholm are just minutes away.
Majken and her boyfriend were super friendly and welcomed me when I arrived and have been very flexible and helpful throughout my stay.
Thank you so much Majken and I hope to come back again to your apartment when I'm back in town. It has been one of my most successful Airbnb experiences :-)"
302496,2414215,2012-09-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Unlike the previous comment, I can assure that the apartment is perfect for a stay in Stockholm.

Hosts Seta and Gören were very welcoming and helpful, took care of adding extra double bed for extra person, buying breakfast for the next day as well.

Apartment is greatly located/decorated, very nice, clean, big and fully equiped.

Have found my new place in town for sure.

And the art is art :)"
1212891,359039168,2018-12-16T00:00:00.000Z,we had a lovely stay at Maud's place and it was a very good location where we were able to catch the metro in to the city centre or enjoy a really lovely walk through Kungshölmen to get to the centre within about an hour (if only we hadn't stopped so often to enjoy the views!)
299154,112420135,2016-11-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Nothing but good things to say about this place. Very easy, quick communication with Daniel. Very helpful and accommodating host throughout the stay. Location is fantastic. In a great neighbourhood, less than 1 minute from Slussen stop. Gamla Stan five minutes away on foot. Apartment provided everything required for the week. Would highly recommend and would stay here again without doubt next time I'm in Stockholm."
723539,56613318,2015-12-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Exceptional stay and everything as advertised by Mathias in his detailed description and instructions. Apartment was immaculate and well-provisioned. Bathtubs are unusual in Swedish apartments. We needed this to care for a baby during our stay (one of the reasons we chose this specific apartment) and this was a life-saver. Washer and \"drying room\" in the basement also easy and convenient to use once we understood the reservation system. Mostly unused, easy to sign-up. A thoughtful neighbor even came to warn us when he was going to over-run his reserved time! Apartment location was exceptional, we could never afford to live full-time in such a hip, convenient, quiet, mixed resi-shopping-restaurants neighborhood, certainly not in a prosperous city such as Stockholm! Close to subway, bus and ferries. Great supermarkets and a \"Food Hall\" that is a tourist destination in itself. Although we only met Mathias in person once, he had prepared for our stay and the instructions were very thorough. When he needed access to pick-up something, he was very sensitive to our privacy and arranged well in advance. The plants seemed to weather my lack of a green-thumb (our stay was unusually long, about ten days) and provided nice ambiance. The USB Internet worked well once I was able to get a laptop working. I hacked my laptop to make it into a WiFi-repeater to extend The USB Internet so I could use with Smart Phones to avoid the expensive cell company data roaming charges, left Mathias with ideas if he wants to make a more permanent solution for those without USB ports. The kitchen was small but nicely designed and outfitted. A pressure cooker was a bonus and let us quickly prepare fresh organic vegetables from the market. The vacuum cleaner worked well once I learned how to adjust it for the various surfaces. Check-in/check-out went smoothly although the taxi driver from the airport first took us to the wrong address and so the entry keypad code didn't work...his mistake and corrected when he came back to get us! I hesitate to recommend Mathias' apartment only for selfish reasons...I hope to stay there in the future again and wish it to be open!! Seriously, if staying in Stockholm regardless of the season, you can't find a better place for a couple, even with a baby in tow! Didn't try the couch/guest bed, this might even allow for more people."
514210,279252372,2018-06-20T00:00:00.000Z,"I rented the room for my parents that were visiting me in Stockholm. They had a great stay in Margareta's place. 
The room is exactly how it shows in the pictures: very comfortable bed, big and beautiful balcony that you will have access to, and a private bathroom with a nice shower. 
The location is very convenient. Three minutes walk to a local center with supermarkets, butiques, restaurants and buses that takes you to a metro station in 10 min. 
Margareta is a great host who is flexible and always helpful."
1212891,44630649,2015-08-28T00:00:00.000Z,"It was great being back at Maud's place, which is the perfect combination of staying in a quiet suburb and being able to make it to central Stockholm  in 15 minutes or less. Maud was really helpful as usual, and even offered to pick up a few items for me when she was on her way to the grocery store. The room is  comfortable and ( just as the smaller one) on the sunny side of the building -- but there's a dark curtain you can roll down if you need to block the early morning sun i the summer."

Lägenheten var lagom för vårt behov av övernattning i ett tyst område utan störande trafik och ändå nära till butiker och T-bana."

He provided good directions to his flat from the harbor and was helpful when we had questions. The tram station requires a bit of walking, but it is very pleasant and pretty in good weather. Would not advise having a lot of big luggage, however.  Magnus greeted us in person, explained things, and was very welcoming. The flat is bright, modern, and comfortable for 2 people.  The building has a lift and a great clothes washing facility. Magnus reserved our access, which worked well for us."

608672,45962496,2015-09-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Karl war sehr nett und hat uns herzlich willkommen geheißen. Da am Tag unserer Ankunft mein Geburtstag war, hatte er uns zwei kleine Flaschen Sekt und etwas schwedischen Kaviar als kleine Aufmerksamkeit organisiert. Das Zimmer selbst ist klein, erfüllt aber seinen Zweck. Das Bett ist weich und bequem, jedoch nichts für Personen die gerne eine harte Matratze mögen. Der kleine TV hat ca 8 Programme, ist jedoch nebensächlich denn Stockholm ist viel zu schön als das man sich mit TV schauen begnügen müsste. Es gibt eine kleine Schrankwand für Klamotten und auf der gegenüberliegenden Seite zwei Herdplatten und einen kleinen Kühlschrank sowie eine Kaffeemaschine (nichts spektakuläres aber es erfüllt alles seinen Zweck). Das Bad ist ebenfalls sehr klein, beim duschen überschwemmt man leider (trotz \"Schutzvorrichtung\") den kleinen Raum, kann den Boden aber mit einem Wischer trocknen. Alles in allem war es sauber. Da man zwei Holztüren zwischen sich und dem Treppenhaus hat, ist er relativ ruhig. Leider konnten wir nicht aus dem Fenster schauen, da das Haus derzeit saniert wird, ansonsten hat es aber keinerlei Einschränkungen gegeben. Die Lage der Wohnung ist top. Man hat in fünf Minuten zu Fuß viele Restaurants und den Beginn der Fußgängerzone. Nach Gamla Stan läuft man ca 15-18 Minuten."
145320,410552409,2019-02-10T00:00:00.000Z,Als je bij Kim verblijft heb je een prima appartement om Stockholm te ontdekken. Dichtbij de metro en het oude centrum. Kim is erg gastvrij.

1173290,14556344,2014-06-22T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a great time staying in Christian's apartment. He was a wonderful host--friendly and helpful up the four flights of stairs to his apartment.  It is a two level apartment with two full bathrooms, 4 bedrooms and two beautiful balconies. It was a perfect location for our conference at Karolinska Institute (about a 10 minute walk) and an easy walk (20 minutes) or subway ride into the center of Stockholm. The Arlanda airport bus stops at St. Eriksplan which is within walking distance to the apartment. We will gladly stay at his place when we visit Stockholm again."

Mikael not only emailed us a pdf with all needed information but also marked maps of nearby places one can go for food, where to find transportation etc.  He was a wonderful host to my father and left a great impression on both of us. (My father was visiting me since I permanently moved to Sweden 1.5 years ago).  I would definitely reccomend this apartment to anyone visiting Stockholm.  Thank you again, Mikael! :)"

Peter was a wonderful host and went way beyond to welcome us. There are 3 good bedrooms with a balcony but sadly had only one bathroom. Else the place was simply the best. I'd definitely recommend Peter's apartment and it's superb value for money."

I very much enjoyed the session and the subsequent drink at the very stylish bar. Here, with a view of the skyline of central Frankfurt, Solveig kindly shared her tips for what to see and do in Frankfurt when one only has so much time to spend there. Very nice combo, yoga + info on Frankfurt"

278311,4127917,2013-04-12T00:00:00.000Z,"I stayed three nights here and I really enjoyed!
It's a bit far from the city centre, so that may be a little bit inconvenient, but on the other hand: It's very quiet here and it's just five minutes walk to the underground and a supermarket.
I only met Linnéa briefly, but she seems to be a very nice person. I also had the opportunity to meet her two nice Italian friends!

Lidia's home is in the perfect location to visit Stockholm, everything is VERY easily accessible.  However, the MOST wonderful part of our stay was our host, Lidia.  She was so inviting, helpful, warm, and welcoming.  When we first arrived she had us for tea/coffee and gave us an overview of the city and places to go and see and do!  She answered all our questions throughout the stay and could not have been more helpful.  In addition, my boyfriend was having sinus problems from all the plane travel and Lidia was so kind and generous to provide some medications/remedies to help him feel better.  We 100% recommend staying with Lidia, she is a genuinely sweet, knowledgeable, thoughtful, accommodating and kind woman and host.   Thank you Lidia for everything, we wish you the very best."

This place is basically an air bnb hostel, with it being shared with several other guests. We were out long hours everyday, so it wasn't the biggest deal, but it did cause some troubles with only onee bathroom for several people and was quite loud at night.

That being said, Peter responds very quickly through the app."

647314,57657643,2015-12-28T00:00:00.000Z,"We only spent the first evening with Mallika before she left for vacation, but she was very welcoming, immediately made us feel at home and showed us where everything was that we might need. Her apartment is stunning - we were so happy to spend Christmas in such a beautiful place. The room was even bigger than it looks in pictures, with tons of natural light and a very comfortable bed. It was a great location - there were plenty of bars and restaurants right around us, and a grocery an easy walk away. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go in the city. I would highly recommend staying in Mallika's beautiful home!"
1204621,137928952,2017-03-18T00:00:00.000Z,"I thought Nettan's place would be too far away from the city centre, but it is only 3 stops on the metro! Also the apartment is in a quiet residential area, very safe, very clean... Nettan was helpful and friendly. She will leave you alone if you like or talk with you if you like... I definitely recommend her place."

The neighborhood is so close to everything you’d want (museums, shopping, food), but it’s also so quiet, so safe, and so clean. Kim herself is a very friendly and impressive woman, and was a warm and thoughtful host. When we come back to Stockholm, we’ll definitely hope to stay here again!"

1234109,38949121,2015-07-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Apart from the wifi being broken for our first couple of nights and some communication issues around that, my girlfriend and I had a wonderful time at Nathalie's apartment. It is spacious, comfortable, and well equipped, and we enjoyed watching a DVD every night while lying in bed!

Location is great, only a short walk from everything. Even though you can walk pretty much everywhere in Stockholm, if you want to take the metro, the station is only a 3 minute walk away. The area, Kungsholmen, is mostly residential but has lots of restaurants and cafes. The pizza place on the corner is very good, and very reasonably priced. There is a supermarket around the corner as well. We were very happy with the location.

The shower was a little bit annoying as there is nowhere to hang up the nozzle, but it is no problem if you want a bath. Also, the bed is actually two single mattresses side by side, which was a little drawback, but both of these things are pretty minor. All in all we would definitely recommend this place!"
313763,91000576,2016-08-03T00:00:00.000Z,What a fantastic place to stay! Near some really amazing food and the train station so we could get around everywhere. The nice TV and sound system was a nice for those days we felt like staying in. Would definitely come back here again!
763407,7161817,2013-09-09T00:00:00.000Z,Wow! This place was perfect for our short stay in Stockholm. We had four adults and there was plenty of space for us all. It was such a beautiful flat and a very relaxing place to come back to after a busy day of sightseeing. Gabriella was so easy to work with and was very flexible with our check in time. She even left us some light breakfast foods. It is very close to the bus line and subway line. Will absolutely recommend to friends!
1307331,406024267,2019-01-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Not only was Marcus great at communicating even before our arrival, but also the place was beyond my expectation. It was spacious, everything was ready and the check-in and check-out was super easy. Marcus's house is close to the train station so it's very easy to get to the center of the city. The place is spacious, clean and super welcoming. I highly recommend to stay at Marcus if you are a big group :) He is a great host and the place is just as great!!"
1153177,14951917,2014-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,"I came to Stockholm for a long weekend with 3 friends.  Terry was really friendly and relaxed, and had generously got us some nibbles and offered us a glass of wine when we arrived which was very much appreciated.

The apartment was bigger and better than expected, with three bedrooms, a large bathroom, dining area, kitchen and living room.  There are balconies on the front and back of the apartment as well.  We were provided with several sets of keys so we were able to do our own thing, towels, wi-fi, and access to a computer, so we had Spotify going all weekend and we were able to look up where to go and how to get around while we were there.

The area was really quiet and safe, and within a five minute walk of the underground network which was very easy to use, safe, clean, and reliable.  The location of the apartment was incredible for the city, but also very good for the Friends Arena - we had travelled to Stockholm to see a band playing there.

I can highly recommend the apartment, and Terry as a host."
1189469,510590346,2019-08-16T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed in this apartment with my husband and two kids. The apartment is beautiful, it was everything you need and you can't beat the location. We used to live in Stockholm and this apartment is super close to everything and in a very nice part of town. The owner was super communicative and nice. There was a small issue with a water leak that he told me in advance and this was resolved smoothy and didn't affect us. We will definitely recommend and will love to be back again."

526170,34864809,2015-06-13T00:00:00.000Z,"We really loved our 10 day stay at Magnus' wonderful comfortable and quiet apartment. All of our questions were easily and promptly answered by email before we arrived, and Magnus met us at the apartment when we arrived and showed us all around. The apartment itself is very spacious, light-filled, clean, and cheerful. It has beautiful wood floors, a good size and well-equipped, easy to use kitchen, and one powder room and one small full bath with tub and shower. We only used the master bedroom, which has a king size very comfortable and firm bed and black out shades, which was nice as it was nearly midsummer and very light at night! There is also another bedroom for children. The apartment is really quiet, with no street noise or noise from other apartments. The area of the city is friendly, safe, and great for walking, with lots of trees, flowers, and birds. There is a lovely park five minutes away. Markets and restaurants are easy to find nearby. It was a very pleasant 20 minute walk into the central areas, depending where one was going. The metro is only a two minute walk and is very fast, frequent, and clean and goes anywhere one is likely to want to go. We really liked the neighborhood and found it the perfect location for seeing Stockholm and taking day trips. Magnus was a great host and we had a perfect stay. Thank you!"

954832,14155505,2014-06-13T00:00:00.000Z,"I stayed in Mikael's apartment for 5 nights in early June, whilst attending a conference in Stockholm. The location was perfect, easy walk to train stations/underground to get anywhere in Stockholm, supermarkets/food/cafes very close etc etc.

Mikael was very friendly and organised, was waiting for me when I arrived (after delays with planes/motorway crash!) and easily accessible throughout the stay (although there were no problems I needed him for). The place was a good size, clean and had all things I needed including a coffee maker. I would definitely stay here again, and happily recommend it to anybody else considering staying here."
536283,20002897,2014-09-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Paolo provided us with all necessary info about the location and the apartment. That helped us to move in and reside there easily! The location is perfect, you live in the center of the Södermalm island in 4min from Tunnelbanna, 5min from Soderhalarna market, and definitely in the middle of lots of bars and restaurants around. The apartment is spacious, supplied with nice bathroom and fully equipped kitchen. There were our best two weeks in Stockholm! Great thanks Paolo, you are the best!"

Good place for a short stay, not too far from the metro; however, if u travel with lot of luggage’s, recommend you take a cab or Uber as the house is on a hill. The view from the hill is just awesome !"

The contact to David was very nice, he gave us good advices for our stay. In the appartment we felt very comfortable. You can feel that two architects live here. Everything is very functional, but warm and welcoming. There was only twice a little noise from the neighbours but this never lasted more than half an hour. Maybe they had a problem to fix. We easily found our way from the airportbus to the appartment, which was the best way (without underground and changing) to travel with the kids. Also bus no 2 is very helpful. We very seldom used the underground. The supermarket is around the corner which is open also during the weekend until 22o'clock and many little restaurants and bars. We had a very pleasant time and we can only recommend David's place. Hope we can come back soon to see more of this beautiful city. 4 days are definitely not enough. Thanks David!"

Mallika est très sympa et s'est rendue disponible lorsque nous avions besoin de ses conseils. Seul hic pour mon conjoint a été de devoir partager la salle de bain avec l'hôte car elle était présente pendant notre séjour... cela manquait parfois d'intimité mais pour quelques jours cela n'a pas été un vrai problème. Je conseille vivement un séjour chez Mallika !

610948,34119511,2015-06-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Lina’s apartment was ideal for our visit to Stockholm. We found plenty of space, especially the living room. All the essentials are there for a comfortable accommodation including excellent wi-fi internet for checking on touring arrangements and keeping in touch with home. We did eat breakfasts and light dinners in the apartment. The kitchen was suitably equipped. We did eat our main meal at lunch to take advantage of the hearty lunch specials offered by many restaurants at reasonable prices. The location was also excellent for our needs. Nearby are many restaurants, cafes, and a large supermarket. However, the location is just far enough away to provide a quiet environment with Stockholm residents. The apartment was also very quiet. We walked to all the attractions in and near “Old Town” and used the water ferry to reach others, such as the Vasa Museum. Public transportation is also nearby as well as taxi service, which we should have used after a long day touring. Lina was very helpful before the departure, and she met us at the apartment and provided helpful suggestions and information. She was also available if we had questions, etc. She did help with a phone calling problem and taxi service to the airport. Highly recommended for travelers wanting to experience Stockholm and Sweden."

Die Anbindung nach Stockholm C und Arlanda C war super und echt easy zu nehmen. Insgsamt ein sehr guter Aufenthalt. Es gab morgens immer ein wenig Brot, Tee/Kaffee, Butter und Käse oder Schinken. Ansonsten konnte die Küche auch so mitbenutzt werden, genauso wie das Bad, die Handtücher und das W-LAN."

We had no problems in finding the apartment, the directions were more than accurate, and we where there in time to get to the supermarket and do some shopping for breakfast. 
The neighborhood is nice and quiet and we even saw rabbits in front of our window when we first arrived!!! :)
Maud's two cats are really adorable and spent some quality time with them in the morning, drinking our coffee. Kinda missed home those moments, but the feeling was great.

We would recommend Maud's room for everyone is looking for some nice cosy place that you can call home after an exhausting day in Stockholm. That place is so warm and welcoming and Maud has a real gift of making you fell welcomed and wanting to spend more time with her. 
Also you can walk for only a few minutes to the nearest Metro station and one really good and huge supermarket."

Flat is spacious, well equipped and wifi is good. Location is perfect as its quiet and free from noise but Yet only 4 min walk from subway. 
Terry was so kind as to have snacks prepared for us on arrival which was awesome since we took the early morning flight from stansted so it was the perfect 'pick me up' to ensure that we Kept our energy up! 
Only thing I will say is apartment possibly could do with some more lighting ( especially in the living room) ..

Thank you Terry!!!"

845365,47110038,2015-09-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Micheal was an incredible host and made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived. He went above and beyond to accommodate our complicated travel arrangements (we'd both arrived from different places in europe and didn't get to the flat until late at night). The sleeping space was perfect and he even bought separate beds to replace the double especially for us! Other than that the house was what we described as 'beautifully busy' which so much fascinating installations and trinkets! He also has the BEST cups for tea and coffee fans! He went above and beyond to make sure our stay in Stockholm was as interesting as possible and even took us on walks around the local area to show us some of the best spots! Staying with him was like staying with family and we really feel like we've found a home away from home. We will most definitely be back!

944853,173978189,2017-07-24T00:00:00.000Z,"My parents and I had beautiful summer holidays in Stockholm. It was for sure the right decision to choose Henriks apartment. We found everything we needed, especially all necessary kitchen utensils, room furnitures and even a modern TV.  The flat is furnished in a very cozy way that you are feeling like home from the beginning. It is very tidy and offers enough space for three people. Furthermore we could use some of Henrik's and Johanna's spices and food. 
The flat is located very centrally close to Medborgarplatsen, with short walking distances to supermarkets, to the tunnelbana or to the old town. The only blemish, for those who are sensitive to noises, was the tumult at night."
1271843,179675924,2017-08-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Andre was a great host. He was very responsive when I needed help with things and gave me some solid recommendations. The apartment is beautiful, clean, and in a good location near Sodra station, metro, city bikes. Walkable to restaurants, shopping and sights. He was only in the apartment for the end of my stay but was genuinely interested to meet and talk in the short time we were both there. And he even made me breakfast! Thanks for hosting and feel free to reach out next time you're in NYC!"

Close to the metro and easy to get downtown, and also cafes nearby in the neighbourhood. Moa met us, and gave us some help with directions and tips on the city, and left us some coffee/tea and chocolate - just what you need after your journey!"
475409,14260437,2014-06-16T00:00:00.000Z,My stay in Cor's apartment was perfect bliss. The apartment is immaculately clean and has everything you need (except wifi). Cor is just a lovely woman who takes care with her guests. The neighborhood has cafes and a mission store should you find you need more warm clothing than you brought with you.
164448,80173958,2016-06-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Very nice neighborhood and apartment exactly as described! Perfect for a few days stay. Lidia was incredibly friendly and provided guides and maps for us, pointing out good areas to go to in the city. There was a microwave, mini fridge, and dishes upstairs in the living area which was perfect for when we made breakfast and had a few groceries to store. The apartment is in a great location in Sodermalm and do-able walking distance from everything in Stockholm! Would love staying with Lidia again if I get to visit Stockholm in the future."

He met me at the station, showed me the apartment, which was even better than described, and kept in contact throughout my stay to make sure I was ok and everything was fine. I can't recommend Sam's place enough. Full of beautiful mid-century furniture in a secure building close to the train line and central Stockholm. DON'T HESITATE TO BOOK WITH SAM! He's great, and so is his place."

206221,152160296,2017-05-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Absolutely fantastic. Elisabeth is a fantastic, lively and amazing host who would recommend you the best walks to get to know the city, not to mention the great lengths she goes to take care of you: we had to leave early and she didn't have the time to prepare us the AMAZING gorgeous breakfast she prepared the first two (Website hidden by Airbnb) she packed some OJ, sandwiches and bananas for the plane. Just astonishing.

Thanks a million Elisabeth, hoep to see you in Tenerife!"
164448,274819822,2018-06-10T00:00:00.000Z,Li has a great apartment in the very trendy Södermalm area of Stockholm. It’s a 20-30 minute to every tourist spot other than the Skansen area which is a little bit further. The train station however is only a 3 minute walk from the apartment. Li’s house is very clean and the room was a fine size for my girlfriend and I. Li also gave us some fantastic recommendations on what to do while in Stockholm. We really enjoyed our stay with Li and would definitely stay with her again.

1153177,214237695,2017-11-25T00:00:00.000Z,"This unit was perfect for our family. There are 3 bedrooms (one with 2 twin beds) which fit our family perfectly. The location is great as it is in Ostermalm (a couple blocks from Stadion underground stop) so you are near everything but it is a quieter part of town. There are amazing playgrounds all over the place. We found a new one everyday. The grocery store, bakery and an italian place are very close by. We were able to eat breakfast and most dinners at the unit which was perfect. Terry was an amazing host. He was flexible, quick to respond, kind and was always available if we needed anything. We would not hesitate to recommend this unit to anyone looking for a fun trip to Stockholm."

Untergekommen sind wir bei Carl's Wohnung:) es sieht genauso aus wie auf den Bildern dargestellt. Alles ist sehr sauber und man fühlt sich sehr wohl. Auch die Lage ist sehr gut. Direkt um die Ecke befindet sich eine Bushaltestelle mit der man ohne Probleme ins Stadtzentrum gelangt. 
Carl ist ein sehr guter Gastgeber...bevor wir anreisten hatte er uns mit Infos versorgt und Kontakt zu uns aufgenommen. An unserer Anreise hatte er uns sogar an der Bushaltestelle abgeholt und zu der Wohnung begleitet und uns dann alles gezeigt. 
Meine Freundin und ich können es nur weiterempfehlen nach Stockholm zu fahren und dann in Carl's Wohnung zu übernachten."

You can easily reach Gamla Stan and City by foot, and the metro station is very close. The apartment was light and supplied with all necessary things. Annika was very welcoming and gave us many advices. She was also very flexible when it came to check in/check out.

Super clean, close to everything you would need, buses are very close.
Central but also close to Nature."

She was incredibly helpful from the very moment we touched down (with directions to get to her apartment with multiple options) to waiting for us in the apartment upon arrival to give us advice on all things Stockholm in person.

First of all it's wonderfully suited in the most fashionable and beautiful part of  of city, called Ostermalm. Even though it's  a rather expensive disctrict, it's still a great place to live, because you can  get to almost every nice and attractive for tourists spot by feet within 30 min. max. The appartment itself  is exactly as it is shown on the pictures. Very clean, nice and cozy. There are fiew nice cafees, and a 24 hour food stores within  2 minutes walk. The only thing that didn't really work was the wifi connection, so you betrer get ready to look for free spots around the city or in the nearby  cafees and restaurants. To say the truth - there are a lot of them all around the city. Mathis is a nice person,  and a great host. I do fully recomment this appartment, it's if definitely worth it's cost."

Apartment size was fine for 3 with 2 mattresses on the floor as the double bed was pretty small.

Paolo also left us a bottle of wine which was a lovely welcoming touch.

My only issue was the apartment was a bit dusty which isn't great for people with allergies."

I would recommend this apartment to anyone with a family.  Also the location is great for adults and children. The balcony and beds make the place cozy. Emma was very accommodating from the beginning.  She let us arrive later after we had agreed upon a time and stay later.  She laid out everything necessary for our family, quickly explained how things worked in the apartment, and left us to discover on our own.   I hope to return!"

Locals were nice, and welcome us into their home to have drinks and play pool . A huge plus was her giant jacuzzi tub!! So nice after a long day."

301680,48514963,2015-09-27T00:00:00.000Z,"ero a Stoccolma per lavoro e ho pensato alla zona di Alsjoi per essere vicina alla fiera.In realtà non ho alloggiato da Anitta perchè mi ha  detto che causa overbooking (??) mi avrebbero ospitato dei vicini nello stesso isolato... ho chiesto più volte le foto ma non mi sono state fornite.
la coppia che mi ha ospitato è stata molto gentile e ospitale anche se la stanza non corrispondeva affatto a quella pattuita,
era in un ground floor con divano letto, sapendolo avrei fatto sicuramente una scelta diversa. inoltre una settimana prima ho avvisato che invece di 3 notte avrei soggiornato per due notti, ed ho trovato grande rigidità dell'host a decurtarmi la notte che non avevo usufruito."
819676,257702481,2018-04-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Great place to stay in Stockholm. Super central, clean and nice. Little details like your own fridge and kettle really made this a perfect stay for me!"
581243,103178385,2016-09-21T00:00:00.000Z,"After a long europe trip, this place was a great surprise.  The location is right next to a metro station and there is a huge mall at the ground floor of this big apartment complex.  The place is huge with a very clean and modern feel.  It's like staying in a very nice IKEA apartment :)  There is a supermarket on the ground floor and I wish that I had stayed at this place longer."
739726,534097449,2019-09-22T00:00:00.000Z,It was a loevely stay at Sanna's place. The beautiful little flat is located in the very heart of Södermalm. There are so many interesting shops and restaurants just around the corner and Sanna is a perfect host. The communication was very fast and caring. I will be back!
1117037,5185851,2013-06-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Polina have been kind with us. her house is so beautiful and clean. My friend and I we've felt free to use the kitchen and some food that Polina had brought for us. The house is very near to the tube station and not so far from the center. near the tube station there is a comfortable super market.
at the end, everything has been good!!!!!
I suggest it to everybody"
338470,23666319,2014-12-07T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed at Gustaf's for a weekend break and he was amazing. Our flight landed after 11pm - but he was fine to let us in after midnight and greeted us with a warm reception and sat down and had a chat with us. He provided us with his very handy pocket book which had maps of the various areas in Stockholm with places of interest, and some of his favourite places highlighted. 

As for the apartment, we wanted to move in it was so nice! It was a creative space but also felt very homely, with candles and ornaments. Gustaf keeps it in great condition as well and offered tea and coffee and fresh towels. Where the apartment was situated was great for us, quiet and safe and we could walk everywhere we wanted to go, but the station isn't far either."
757320,5613316,2013-07-08T00:00:00.000Z,"We absolutely loved our stay in Stockholm! We were there for 5 days (4 nights) and didn't even see everything. The appartment had a super location! 2 minutes walking from the best view on Gamla Stan and the rest of Stockholm. It is also a few minutes walking away from a public bike rental stand. The bike is definitely the best way to explore Stockholm, provided it isn't raining of course. A 3-day ticket was160 SEK (around 18€) and there is always a bike available. Just take it and drop it off somewhere else. 
Barb was very friendly and we could use the bathroom, kitchen and fridge without any problem. Everything was clean and bedcovers and towels very provided.
The area of the appartment (Södermalm) is a decent area and a good starting point for your trip in Stockholm.
Definitely approved!"
299154,505554609,2019-08-09T00:00:00.000Z,Great location. Easy walk to old town and in a cool area with great restaurants and market nearby. Host gave us plums from his garden!
299154,267083715,2018-05-21T00:00:00.000Z,Daniel was a great host and very accommodating as we had to add on another person last minute. His place is in a great location just a quick walk to Old Town and around a lot of great little cafe's and restaurants.
274876,324617913,2018-09-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Emma’s place is beautiful, updated, clean, cozy....makes you feel at home when you’re not. We stayed here with our three kids and it could not be more perfect for us! Two of them stayed in a room with two singles, we had a master bedroom and our baby had a room to himself with a crib she set up for us prior to arrival. This is the perfect place to stay with your family! My husband and I also enjoyed wine on the balcony after the kids went to bed. Emma is a wonderful host, she helped provide recommendations prior to our trip and was a resource if needed while we were there. She also left us with traditional food and some groceries to get us started. And cookies! :) I would definitely stay here again if I were ever to come back, and I would recommend this place to anyone. We felt so lucky to have found it!"
283446,34373008,2015-06-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Thanks a lot for this super good stay!
Everything went well, the apartment was super clean and the room had anything you need, incl. fast WIFI connection.

Bala is a pretty nice host and takes really care about the guests needs. Every morning, Bala prepared a fresh and delicious breakfast - thanks again!

I really recommend this comfort stay, next to Akalla Metro station (15 minutes from T-Centralen Stockholm) - pretty easy to go there!"
1248490,23895761,2014-12-14T00:00:00.000Z,"We hebben ons erg thuis gevoeld bij Maria. Een warme ontvangst met vers brood en een gezellige inrichting. Groot genoeg voor zes mannen, al lagen twee personen op een matras op de grond. Een leuke omgeving vlak bij winkeltjes en restaurants, metro op 10 minuten afstand lopen. Super dat we zo flexibel mochten in- en uitchecken! Een aanrader!"

The apartment's location was AWESOME and I loved the neighborhood it was in - Sodermalm. She has a cat, Ramses, who was an absolute sweetheart! The room looked exactly like pictured and was very spacious. She was very accommodating and I would recommend her apartment if anyone needed a place to stay in Stockholm! Would definitely stay here again."
442837,457038234,2019-05-23T00:00:00.000Z,"I stayed at Jo’s for two nights. She was a great hostess. The bedroom was nice and I would definitely stay there again. Jo was quick in responding to my questions. The area was quiet at night which helps with a good sleep.  It was also very convenient (2min walk to the subway and close to restaurants, coffee shops, and a lake nearby). The room had a desk on which I could do some work on my laptop. Check-in and out went smoothly."

1243144,7455496,2013-09-21T00:00:00.000Z,"We felt extremely lucky to stay in such a great apartment in a fantastic location.  Looking out the window you could see up and down Hornsgatan, and you knew you were somewhere special.  
We were at the northern end of Sodermalm, a short walk from Gamla Stan and very close to the Mariatorget tunnelbana.  
The apartment had a large living area (where someone could sleep if required) as well as two separate bedrooms, so there was a lot of room.  The bathroom is small but who cares?  Annika left coffee and other condiments for our use which was appreciated. Checking in and out was easy as Annika's Dad lives close by.  
Staying at Annika's made us feel very Swedish for a few days!"
1262188,36780054,2015-07-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Great host, went out of her way to accommodate our stay. The description of the flat was accurate and a great place to stay. The flat is easily within walking distance to city center and only a couple of blocks to the subway. The place is clean with lots of natural light.

Läget är bra för den som skall jobba på Kungsholmen som jag gjorde, och det är väldigt nära centrum. WiFI var snabb och bra. Värden svarade snabbt på frågor och anpassade incheckningstiden när mitt tåg blev inställt och jag kom fram senare. Kan vara bra att veta att det är gasspis i köket. Microvågsugnen är gömd i skåpet ovanför kylskåpet."

Close to the metro, close to shopping and there is a grocery store and systembologet very close by.  We walked everywhere from here, and it was wonderful.  So quiet at night, too!

Moa was a really great host. We didn't have the pleasure to meet her, but she arranged everything fine for the exchange of the keys, and her mom even came to pick us up at the metro station on our arrival.
She was really nice and even let us leave the apartment pretty late on our last day, so we could enjoy the city without being weigh down by our luggages.
Thank you again, Moa!"

916806,161502548,2017-06-18T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a four days stay at Julias place near to nature. We really recommend the apartment for people who want both: nature and city. We took the short cuts (as Julia described) into the city and to the beach - so there is nothing to criticize about the distance! In the evening we cooked and used the terasse - there we only missed comfy chairs to watch the sunset! Julia was easy to deal with and as we missed a second bedlinen on arrival, Julia took care of this problem immediately."

916806,68692343,2016-04-06T00:00:00.000Z,"A verry well organised apartment. We had a great stay. Only a few minutes walk from the shops and the metro. To the city center it takes approx 20 minutes with the metro.p
Two points: 1. for the view on the lake you have to go outside and 2.  the pump is rather noisy even at night. Perhaps some isolation will help."

Nous n'avons pas vu Madeleine mais elle a ete très présente et prévenante par mail.
Les photos sont représentatives de l'appartement, clair, propres. Mais une fois que l'on est dans l'appartement, c'est encore mieux.
Tous les appareils ménagers fonctionnaient bien.
Nous avons croisé des voisins très chaleureux et sympathiques."

She showed trust and left us with space for us to feel at ease. She was kind enough to leave valuable information about the neighbourhood on the kitchen table and even had food for our first breakfasts. We enjoyed the quiet neighbourhood with public transports (bus and t-banna) very close by. The t-banna line is the red one which takes you right to Hornstull. Mariatorget, Slussen, Gamla Stan, etc. Also very near to at least one small playground (walking distance). The apartment was great for the two people and a toddler and as a lot of light. The description of the apartment was accurate."

Die Lage der Wohnung unmittelbar in der Nähe eines Sees mit Badestelle ist ein Traum. Man kann zu jeder Zeit ein kühles Bad nehmen. 
Die Nachbarschaft ist sehr angenehm und leise. 
Der ÖPNV ist perfekt an diesem Standort, die Taktung des Buses liegt zwischen 10 und 30 Minuten, nahezu rund um die Uhr. Das gilt auch an Wochenenden und Abends (30 Minutentakt). Es gibt immer Anschluss am S-Bahn Bahnhof (hier auch ein guter coop Supermarkt vorhanden! Lidl ist ca. 3 km von der Wohnung entfernt.
Die Wohnung ist sehr sauber und ordentlich und vollständig eingerichtet. 
Der Kühlschrank war sogar mit einem Starterkit gefüllt inkl. Brötchen. 
Madeleine und Thomas haben unseren Aufenthalt zu einem perfekten Ereignis gemacht. Unsere Kinder (beide 11) haben sich sehr über die Möglichkeit gefreut die Hasen füttern zu dürfen. 
Ich kann es nur allen empfehlen hier zu buchen."

313763,68456974,2016-04-05T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed nearly two weeks in Martin´s flat in Stockholm in early Spring. Having previously lived many years in Stockholm, I knew right away that Martin´s flat was in a top location. The flat is centrally located and very close to public transportation including busses and subway. Nearby are many trendy restaurants but also supermarkets and stores. Close to the flat is located a chiropractor university where students offer treatment at reduced prices - I had a great great experience there. 

The flat itself is very spacious and confortable with all necessary amenities. I find it ideal for people staying longer periods in Stockholm. I particularly enjoyed the flat´s robot vacuum cleaner - I even decided to purchase one for myself. Martin is very easy going and provided us with all the information and help we needed to have a pleasant stay in Stockholm. When coming to Stockholm again, I will surely try to stay here again!"

1153177,39370841,2015-07-23T00:00:00.000Z,We stayed at Terry's apartment for a week. Terry was a great host and gave us a warm and helpful welcome.  The apartment is very quiet and just a few minutes walk to Stadion metro station. Restaurants and grocery stores nearby.  Great rental for a family.

She was wonderful, responsive and positive. She leaves a box full of suggestions of things to do. I’ve traveled a fair amount and this was probably my favorite all time place to stay."
1234960,473895054,2019-06-22T00:00:00.000Z,Jacob made sure we had a great stay. He was communicative and friendly. His house has a big beautiful garden which we really enjoyed. Highly recommended!

259025,18597561,2014-08-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Ali was very nice to us. His house is very clean and all in order. Our room was very comfortable, bright and large enough for the two of us.
The location was what we were looking for, close to bus stop, short walking distance to metro station and a convenient store across from the house. He sent us a message before check in giving us clear directions how to come to his house and he even suggested to buy the 7 day transportation card which we enjoyed (even though we only stayed 4 nights) but it was cheaper and we could hope in hop off in trams, buses, trains and even some boats. It was really worth!
Overall we had a very nice stay there and it was nice to be in a very clean and cute house.
Thanks Ali.
Rafael and Cecilia."

Even though we arrived really late at night she organised the key delivery fabulously.
The apartment's location is excellent, right in the centre of the hip district Södermalm. We also really enjoyed the harmonic Asian touch of her flat, which was very clean and well equipped.
Overall, we can recommend her accomodation without any restrictions!"
581243,289439628,2018-07-12T00:00:00.000Z,Edwin’s apartment is just as described.  It was really clean with a very comfortable bed. The location of the apartment suited our needs for the exploration of the museums and the city. Edwin’s attention to detail is outstanding and we really appreciated his thorough instructions on getting to the airport via public transport. A pleasant stay with a very nice host.

299154,154323124,2017-05-24T00:00:00.000Z,We love staying at Daniel's place. His studio apartment is located in the hip neighborhood of Sodermalm and it's close to cute shops and bars and restaurants. We definitely recommend this location to anyone visiting Stockholm.
442837,8806320,2013-11-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Jo's place is great. It's a few steps away from Liljeholmen station, and only one stop from Södermalm (Hornstull) nd it's also very easy to get to Östermalm from there as well. The apartment was very clean and comfortable, and in a quiet area. I didn't get to meet Jo since she was travelling, but her mother met me and gave me the keys. She was very polite and helpful. I would recommend it to anyone going to Stockhölm."

I really enjoyed the time here, I can't thank Nettan enough for her hospitality :) You won't regret staying here to explore Stockholm!"

The location is really good and central - if you like walking you can reach everything by foot. Also the airport shuttle bus is closed by.
However the interior of the apartment seems to be quite old and it is also quite small. The pictures seem to be taken at another point of time."
763407,31867669,2015-05-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Auf meiner Reise durch die Schären hatte ich kein Internet und habe deshalb per sms und telefonisch mit Gabriela meine Ankunft in STockholm besprochen. Sie war extrem hilfsbereit, unkompliziert und äusserst nett am Telefon. So war es denn auch, als wir uns persönlich kennenlernten.
Wir durften sogar eine Stunde früher als abgemacht einchequen und Gabriela wollte für uns noch Frühstück kaufen. Sehr flexibel und sehr nett.
Die Wohnung ist unglaublich schön, sehr stylish eingerichtet und doch total kuschelig. Alles wahnsinnig sauber. Man fühlt sich sofort total wohl. 
Ca 15 Minuten walk in die City. Kein Problem auch mit der U-Bahn."
1182616,28955850,2015-04-01T00:00:00.000Z,Nice location and nice room. The flat has thin walls though and it can get quite noisy with other guests staying in the apartment. We didn't meet Peter at all during our stay. We would have appreciated him checking the bathroom before we arrived. Otherwise in written contact he was nice and helpful.

242188,315141036,2018-08-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Li is a lovely host, as a solo female traveler I felt safe at all times at her place. It is in a nice area, close to public transport and very quiet at night (great for sleeping). There is a fridge and microwave to heat up any food you need, plus tea and coffee. The bathroom was very clean and great pressure in the shower, always nice to warm up after a long day exploring. Li was fantastic as a host and gave great tips for traveling around and what to see. Check in was a breeze, my flight got in at midnight, as it was delayed. Li was so kind and stayed up until 2 am giving me helpful directions from the airport to her place and getting me settled into her apartment. She went above and beyond that night and I felt so safe knowing that in a foreign city she was there to help me even though I arrived so late. She also let me leave my bags at her place on the final day (I had a night flight) so I could finish my time in Stockholm without having to drag around my luggage. I highly recommend this Airbnb and Li!"
274876,5555266,2013-07-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice apartment that was very useful for our family of 4. Great kitchen and a very friendly 'help yourself' note on the fridge! Enjoyed our 4 day stay and very much enjoyed the space. Emma, even though she was on vacation was responsive to emails. Very helpful."
916806,213831892,2017-11-23T00:00:00.000Z,"First of all, I want to thanks God that we are in a good health. It was our first time when we didn’t like the apartment at all. I am very upset to write that but this will help somebody in future. This is not an apartment as we thought, it is actually a basement (even a cellar), I could easily touch the ceilings by my head (I am not too tall). This basement has only one window that could be opened (but only for 5-10 cm), it has only two windows and the second one is covered with mold!!! I now the reason, but it must to be eliminated. The main reason is that this place doesn’t have heating at all!!!! There is an air-conditioner but it isn’t enough for a such cold place! There is a heat-insulated floor at the entrance, but it is one meter length-ways. The air-conditioner couldn’t reach the bathroom and the bed (you don’t have bedroom, it is right behind the cold wall). But the most terrifying things were THE SOUNDS! You can’t sleep due to loud sounds of the water system (I don’t know exactly what it was). We would never rent the «sharing» apartment in a basement or a cellar (even if I am a big fan of Harry Potter). The bathroom (the bath cabin) is moldy too, and it is need to be replace due to its old conditions. There was no soap neither in the kitchen nor in the bathroom (so we pour the shower gel). How stiff were the towels, like wooden.  The bed was cold and awful! We left with backache. And I am wonder, how old is the washcloth?
BTW, the Internet was awful too!
The location is perfect, but you won’t be able to admire this panoramic view from the apartment, it is wrong and confusing idea. It is 30 min from the old city center but we knew it, it is okay.
WARNING! If you are choosing «Entire place» in the Airbnb, check it because you may leave under somebody.
It is a case when the hosts want to get money but don’t want to do everything properly. Even the pan was in a bed condition (it couldn’t be damaged by gests because the place has an electric stove, and the damage is like from the gas stove). In Ukrainian we say «зроблено абияк, лише щоб відчепилися».
Three words: cold, dirty, bаd WIFI."
1153177,8237495,2013-10-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Terry is an amazing host and a very nice person to meet! We arrived a bit late, he was patiently waiting for us and made a delicious breakfast. He's a great cook! We had some questions and Terry helped us to solve them, and gave advices about the city. Before arrival he replied very fast, and it was easy to talk to him.
Apartment is spacios and well decorated. You really feel like home there. It's located in walking distance from the center and just 2-3 min from metro station. Neighborhood is very quiet and peaceful, and if you're lucky you'll meet a rabbit, just 10 meters from the front door! Perfect place to stay! I'm almost sure that next time we'll stay there again."

Carl真的是很nice的房东,一直会关心我们到哪里了,该怎么走,而且我们把时间弄错了,导致让Carl来房子等我们两次,但他还是非常和善的告诉我们很多关于旅游的信息,并且屋内有很多黑胶唱片和一个很棒的B&o 音响,广播的音色也能展现的很清晰和明亮,于是我也买了一个｡"

It is quiet and well lit, it contains commodity needed for long or short stays, it is close to the transports (just a short ride from downtown Stockholm!), and the bed is very comfortable, which is a must after a long day of walking around the city.
Unfortunately, we didn't get the chance to meet with Anna, but she was quick to answer whenever we had a question and she gave us clear indications as how to get to her apartment. 
I would definitely rent her place again if ever I have the chance to visit Sweden again."
242188,3005855,2012-12-02T00:00:00.000Z,Lidia is very helpful in recommending things to do and anything you may need while you stay in Stockholm.

Visiter Stockholm ne pose aucun problème : la station de métro à 15' à pieds vous amène dans tous les endroits de cette ville à taille humaine que vous souhaitez visiter. Tout est accessible ...même en chaise roulante.
Bref nous avons passé un long week end superbe et remercions Dany pour ses conseils avisés."

Plus, also very convenient, you have 2 supermarkets just next to the metro station. The apartment is spacious and very clean with everything you need. But as the description also says, it's a very bright apartment. Which is very nice at daytime, but if you have troubles sleeping in the light, bring a sleeping mask. In spring and summer the sun comes up véry early :). Annika is also very open and helpful if you would need information. We can definitely recommend this place."

The pictures barely do it justice - it's quite roomy (except for the compact Scandinavian bathroom) and comfy, very well decorated, light, and clean.  It's also a fantastic location - Södermalm is a great vacation base with food, shopping, and neighborhood charm all around, plus the flat is about 3 small blocks to a metro stop so it's quick to get anywhere else in the city.  The only bad thing about my stay here is that it didn't last longer!

Lina is also a great host.  She left us a super handy map of the immediate area with her restaurant and shopping recommendations.  She made sure we were taken care of and quickly answered any questions we had, even though she was on vacation herself.  She went above and beyond in numerous other tiny ways, too.  Basically, she's the perfect airbnb host!

All in all, I really can't recommend this apartment highly enough."
