700113,7424972,2013-09-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Illona's apartment is as described, ideal for 2 people, with a small kitchen corner. In the bedroom there is a table for sitting and eating, which is a bit cramped, though. The balcony is very pleasant, the sofá comfortable, the bed has a soft matress. Illona's animals don't disturb at all, but she does start receiving her pets early in the morning, which may disturb a bit, if you wish to sleep a bit more. The apartment's location is great, I would not walk to the central station with suitcases, but the subway is just 5 min away, and there are just 2 stops there. Overall everything went fine, and I would recommend this apartment for future guests. Just bare in mind that suggested prices are 1 guest based, and that a second person makes it a bit more expensive than the price which shows first on the system."

We had a great time in Stockholm with two of my friends, and the flat was a big contributor to the overall experience. Thanks Anita for offering your place! :)"
755843,434064234,2019-04-07T00:00:00.000Z,Pär's place was excellent and very well priced! I suited us perfectly as we love to cook a lot while away and the kitchen was very well equipped. It was close to a bus and metro station but also the main sights were still walk able. He let us check in as soon as we arrived in Stockholm and when we had a late flight the last day - let us leave our bags at his place. All in all a very pleasant stay - thank you!
1272348,84336881,2016-07-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Magnus was so helpful, his flat is great and tidy. He offered me whiskey when arrived. He answered all my questions. I definetely recommend you to stay in house!"
1170766,95001636,2016-08-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Nous avons passé un très bon séjour à Stockholm. Nous avons trouvé le logement très facilement. Tout était bien expliqué. L'appartement est très lumineux, fonctionnel et avec de l'espace. Il est également très bien situé: métro et supermarchés à côté ouverts jusqu'à 23 heures. Nous avons été très bien accueilli par Annika. Elle a pris le temps de tout nous expliquer et a été très disponible tout au long de notre séjour. Le dernier jour, on a pu quitter l'appartement quand on a voulu ce qui nous a permis d'en profiter jusqu'au bout. Merci à Annika. Nous garderons un très bon souvenir de Stockholm et de ses habitants."

Jarl is a nice host, he'll prepare everything in advance and provide any help. The community is just 10 minutes to the central station, supermarket/ metro/ bus all are nearby. This is my first tour alone, the Stockholm is a beautiful city, i can't wait my next vacation could be Stockholm again. Hope can visit here soon !"

1048260,12949535,2014-05-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Annika's apartment is beautiful and inspiring, very much like the person i'm sure she is ! We didn't meet in person, but she was really sweet and helpful in all the contacts we had.
When i was in Stockholm the weather was not very good, but it wasn't a problem because i had such a nice place to stay. The bed is comfortable and the neighbourhood is very quiet ; but more than that, it is definitely true the place has great energy. 
Staying in Annika's apartment made my trip to Stockholm unique ! Loved it !"
1182616,98011073,2016-08-29T00:00:00.000Z,"We enjoyed staying in this room in Stockholm. It is a good location not far from city centre and very quiet if your room is facing out the back. The kitchen was well equipped and the bedroom comfortable, the balcony very nice. We got on quite well with the other guests too."
763407,12267387,2014-04-28T00:00:00.000Z,"We spent a wonderful time in a very comfortable appartment. Gabriella was a perfect  and friendly host giving us all needed informations and answering all our questions immediately. The flat is situated in a part of stockholm which is absolutely nice to live. The tunnelbanan is five minutes to go and if you want to discover the city by walking - go on, you will have a lot of fun."
1048668,467970552,2019-06-11T00:00:00.000Z,Melissa is very nice and pretty. The house is bit far from the city. There are two train station and bus station. The house is clean and cosy. Thank you very much:)
283446,31155842,2015-05-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Vidhatri and her family are just wonderful.  She's very caring host, Also she prepare food on a daily bases better then a gourmet chef. The room is very large and  bright can accomodate 2 easily . Takes about 15 min by underground from central station. I would choose this accommodation again? Definitely!!!  Many thanks again."
875505,10277343,2014-02-10T00:00:00.000Z,"A beautiful apt. and a great location! I have been visiting Stockholm over 10 years and this was one of my best stays.  Very clean and everything was walking distance.  Electra was a great host and checked up on us to make sure we did not need anything.  If this apt is available on my next visit to Stockholm, will definitely be booking again. Thank you Electra!:)"
1184553,512131873,2019-08-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Très bon séjour dans une grande chambre au sein double appartement situé en plein cœur de Södermalm, quartier vivant et branché de Stockholm. 
Annbritt est réactive et très agréable."
620848,3524280,2013-02-12T00:00:00.000Z,We stayed 10 days and we are very pleased. Hanna was helpful and the rooms were clean and fresh. There was nothing to complain about.
536283,157078844,2017-06-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Palio's place couldn't have been more ideally located for my stay. Right in the heart of Sodermalm and walking distance to literally everything, Paolo's place is ideal for a stay in Stockholm whether it's your first time or if you return. Highly recommended."
1054406,34771169,2015-06-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Lägenheten är ljus, fin och ren och hade allt vi behövde. Madeleine och Thomas var där när vi kom, välkomnade oss på bästa sätt. Våra pojkar blev genast inbjudna att leka med deras två söner.
Vår vistelse var fantastisk!"
478105,37134903,2015-07-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Super Lage, alles da. Kostenloses Parken."
164448,6927382,2013-08-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Deux très bonnes nuits dans un quartier résidentiel très calme mais proche du quartier branché de SoFo, éloigné des pièges à touristes du centre mais très accessible. 
Lidia est très accueillante mais nullement invasive : à la Suédoise !"
608672,126376113,2017-01-11T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a lovely stay at Karl’s place in Stockholm. The location is perfect and very close to everywhere you need to go. It’s just minutes’ walk to the central station where you can find an amazing food hall!
The apartment is very cozy and inside a lovely traditional Swedish building. Karl was away while we were there but his wife Karin took good care of us!
We would recommend this place to everyone who is visiting Stockholm."
1124388,459373498,2019-05-27T00:00:00.000Z,Carl's place is lovely and located not very far from the city centre (15min by bus). We had a lovely time and Carl was very attentive and ensured everything went smoothly with checking in and out and during our stay. Would definitely recommend it!
242188,261835739,2018-05-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Had a wonderful stay at Li's. She's a very kind, helpful and charming person. Great location, close to everything in Stockholm. Everything was clean. Highly recommended."
916806,237037815,2018-02-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Wonderful place with great sights to the water. Location is perfect if you like the suburbs with close walk to the subway (30min to city center and no transfers nevessary in subway lines). Everything is as described (including cooking utensils set for 4 persons) and Julia is a good host, excellent communication and the self check-in is very easy."
1035775,319344299,2018-09-06T00:00:00.000Z,A cozy studio apartment. Perfect for a couple or single.  Magnus was a great host; responsive and welcoming. The balcony was great for morning coffee.  A bit further from the city. Find the Metro (subway) at Thordisplan and it's easy quick ride to all Stockholm has to offer
278311,1407292,2012-06-03T00:00:00.000Z,"I stayed at Linnéa's apartment for 3 nights and was pleasantly surprised by her friendliness and hospitality. Linnéa was very helpful in getting around Stockholm and the apartment felt very homelike. It's also well connected to the city, being close both to subway and commute train stations. "
1153177,14344818,2014-06-17T00:00:00.000Z,A great trip and a great home. Thank you Terry.  We will see you next time we are in Stockholm!!
1182616,37192528,2015-07-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Peter's place was fine for the one night we stayed there. After toting  our luggage from central station to the train station near his apartment and down the street a few blocks, it was disappointing that the place was pretty warm with little air flow. The balcony is mostly enclosed by glass so opening the window doesn't get a breeze and there were no fans. Peter was a helpful host though with clear direction on getting in and gave us space once there. One thing we didn't realize was he sometimes has multiple air BB guests at one time."
916806,435097841,2019-04-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Все очень понравилось. Чисто, аккуратно, удобное месторасположение,все необходимое есть в квартире, вид шикарный.Спасибо"

1137050,10251420,2014-02-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Ideal location, charming apartment, and not least, Gabriel was an excellent host. Would highly recommended and would happily stay again."
1212891,64360225,2016-03-03T00:00:00.000Z,Maud is a really lovley Person and a great host. She helped us very much with all things. The appartment is small but beautifull and cosy. The Metro station and a big supermarket are near by. Staying at Mauds place made our trip to Stockholm fanatstic :)
299154,142181402,2017-04-07T00:00:00.000Z,"We can't recommend this apartment enough!
The apartment is perfectly located at the southern tip of the old city and is comfortable, spacious and well-furnished. Perfect for a stay for a couple.

We loved it!

Daniel was an amazingly generous host as when we were stuck for travel to the airport after the terrorist attacks, he drove us all the way - so so kind and generous! We can't thank him enough."
1128990,277318370,2018-06-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Anette is a great host, her apartment is lovely and has the best location both to reach the city and to find hippest restaurants, bars and shops in the city"
1119738,7858183,2013-10-06T00:00:00.000Z,It was great staying in Anna´s house.  Anna is very friendly and answers every mail very quickly. The house is nice and located in a quiet and safe neighborhood. There is about 5-10 minutes walk to the nearest subway station and from there about 10 minutes to downtown Stockholm.  Would recommend this to everyone.
1182616,5650430,2013-07-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Great place to stay and Peter was of good help, providing us with some maps and useful info about the neighborhood. Loved the balcony."
1212891,464346844,2019-06-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Absolutely recommend this place. It’s a little outside the city but in a beautiful, quite area. Totally felt like home the whole time. 
Maud is super nice, everything was clean. Her cat Sammy is cute and super chilled. We enjoyed it a lot."
164448,291657658,2018-07-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Li is really really kind to give us suggestions useful information about the city. We felt  sorry to arrive at her place quite early in the morning, but she waited for us kindly and welcomed. The room is tidy and the location is also nice close to the train station södra and metro station. A perfect holiday here and i’m Sure to come back again"
533880,30043289,2015-04-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Majoittaja oli vastassa, kun menin asunnolle. Tuntui, kuin olisin mennyt vanhan kaverin luokse. Huone oli oikein siisti ja kuvauksen mukainen. Tämä oli ensimmäinen AirBnB-majoittumiseni ja olen iloinen, että se oli Jarlin luona.

Suosittelen!!"
299154,72992101,2016-05-06T00:00:00.000Z,"We were lucky enough to arrange an early check in as it was a public holiday in Stockholm. Daniel showed us around his apartment and was easily contactable during our stay (we didn't need to get in touch as we had no problems.) 

His apartment was cosy for 3 of us (2 on double bed and 1 on sofa.) It was only a 3 minute walk to the metro 3-5 minutes to bus stops. Great neighbourhood too. 

We would definitely stay again!"
974175,196709956,2017-09-24T00:00:00.000Z,Sofie är en fantastisk värdinna som verkligen bryr sig om att man ska trivas hos dem vilket man gör så fort man kliver in genom dörren. Lägenheten är fantastisk och läget är perfekt. Detta var min andra vistelse hos dem och det är definitivt inte den sista. Kan varmt rekommendera dem som värdar.
974175,152153766,2017-05-15T00:00:00.000Z,"An absolutely beautiful apartment which is much bigger than the photos suggest. The location is great if you want somewhere a little outside the centre (maybe 20 minutes walk which is perfect for a pre and post wander after a days sight seeing). There is also plenty to see and do around the apartment area including parks, restaurants and bars. We didn't catch the metro much as preferred to walk but it's very close and reliable.
Although the apartment is very stylish we felt extremely at home and didn't feel as if we were in a 'display house' ... it's a warm, relaxing home.
Each room is very well appointed, especially the kitchen, perfect if you plan to eat in from time to time (you'll probably not find or be able to open the bin for a few attempts but that was part of the fun!). The addition of SONOS throughout was a huge bonus as we use that all the time at home.
The area is lovely and quiet so you'll be sure of a perfect nights sleep in the super comfortable bed.
Sofie was extremely helpful from the point of booking right through to the duration of our stay and was quick to respond and help when we needed help / advice.

I can't recommend this apartment more highly, it was perfect."
313195,53616086,2015-11-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Beautiful apartment! I couldn't recommend more, everything was perfect for our weekend in Stockholm. You can even walk to the city it is just perfect."
1182616,6155465,2013-08-01T00:00:00.000Z,Well locate apartment and really nice balcony ! Good stay at Peter's!
1124388,256652064,2018-04-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Appartement accueillant, idéal pour deux personnes en court séjour. Le quartier est très calme, très agréable pour la promenade. Il y a des commerces et des restaurants au pied de l'immeuble. Pour aller en centre ville il faut prendre le bus et le métro. C'est rapide et cela permet de voir les différents quartiers de la ville. Carl a été très accueillant, très prévenant. Il s'est libéré pour nous accueillir et nous a donné de bons conseils de sorties."
1054406,105255045,2016-10-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Thomas was super welcoming and we had a great time in Sweden.
The apartment is very spacious and had everything we needed. There is a beautiful lake and an old, pretty café nearby, all very quiet and relaxing. But it's also quite convenient and quick to get to Stockholm centre.
I would definitely stay there again when I'm in Stockholm."
541875,23464494,2014-12-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Vi hadde en veldig fin helg i Stockholm i Martins leilighet! Vi fikk gode instrukser på hvordan å komme seg fra flyplassen, og ble møtt av en venn av Martin (Martin var ikke i byen) som viste oss til døren. Leiligheten var ryddig og fin, og lå også rett i nærheten av T-bane og dagligvarebutikker. Vi vil absolutt anbefale denne leiligheten, og kan godt tenke oss å bo her igjen ved en seinere annledning!"
164448,355247979,2018-12-03T00:00:00.000Z,"everything was nice, very good public transport, recomend to everyone!"
343925,22617937,2014-11-10T00:00:00.000Z,"I booked Annika's apartment for my aunt who visited me. The communication with Annika worked perfectly, my aunt was absolutly happy with her lovely apartment. Calm surrounding, but still very central on Kungsholmen, close to the metro and everything you need."
647314,175461603,2017-07-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Loved our stay here! This apartment is amazing and central to shops, cafes and restaurants. Mallika was pleasant to deal with and very accommodating."
442837,4476669,2013-05-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Jo's appartment is really spacious and well located ( only 1 minute from the tube station) The place is new, clean and very calm with a lovely balcony. I 've enjoyed my stay at Jo's and her mother is particulaly lovely: she showned me all the places of interrest in Town and indicated me a few internet spots in town 
in case I wanted connections. We even had tea and pastries the morning I left and a had nice chat!! I havn't met Jo because she was off in Peru but I can tell she is a verry nice person thanks to her mum! Stockholm is splendid and I recommand to visit the city and stay at Joana's!"
1271843,104316386,2016-09-26T00:00:00.000Z,Andre and Johanna are absolutely lovely hosts. They are well connected in Stockholm and have traveled the world. This makes them the perfect couple to recommend cool places to go and to offer cultural insights. Bed comfortable and bathroom clean. The apartment is absolutely central and steps away from some of the best and less touristy bars in Sodermalm. I would go back tomorrow if I could. These guys are what airbnb is all about and I consider them good friends after my stay.
1307331,478800453,2019-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Empfehlenswert! 
Sehr gute Ausstattung. Sehr gute Lage. Wir waren zu sechst und hatten noch Platz für mindestens 2 Personen.  Ruhige Nachbarschaft und sehr gemütliche Terrasse."
819676,116419462,2016-11-30T00:00:00.000Z,This place was amazing! Highly recommended!
647314,114990703,2016-11-21T00:00:00.000Z,Mallika is 1st class all the way. Highly recommended.
164448,262252128,2018-05-08T00:00:00.000Z,"We were very lucky to stay at Li's place. She is a terrific host - with a fondness for orchids - who makes you feel at home the moment you arrive and helps you figure out what to visit in this fantastic city. Also, the location can't be beat: Södermalm is the perfect spot from which to base your visit of the city. Place can't be beat!"
299154,53827394,2015-11-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Very good location, you can go everywhere you want. 
The room has all the necessary facilities. Daniel is a helpful guy as well."

1149820,92763372,2016-08-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Klara's place is great! Clean and nicely furnished/decorated which gives a 'feel-good atmosphere'. Good location: Easy and fast to get to the city central and other parts of Stockholm. The area is lovely with lots of things going on during weekends (markets, food trucks, music etc), and swimming, long beautiful walks and forest. Communication, checking in and out was very smooth and easy."
536283,154782115,2017-05-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Paolo's place is perfect for a Stockholm city trip. It's very conveniently located just on the edge of Södermalm and yet on a very quiet street. A block away is a square with fantastic cafes, restaurants and boutiques, 20 min walk across the bridge will take you to the Old town. The subway is 3 min away but I didn't take it once as I could walk everywhere.
The place itself is as pictured, very bright and airy and has a lovely district view.
Sometimes choosing an area to stay in can be a hit and miss, but I would stay in exactly the same district (and side of the district) if I visit Stockholm again."
1205051,33568457,2015-05-30T00:00:00.000Z,Viktor was a wonderful host with a beautiful apartment. He was very accommodating when we were trying to figure out how to pick up keys!
164448,500535204,2019-08-02T00:00:00.000Z,A very nice location. The hostess is very friendly to us. She gave us many suggestions and helped us a lot. It was a beautiful house and very close to the metro station and near the old city. It was a pleasant trip! Thank you again!
1271843,44462335,2015-08-26T00:00:00.000Z,"A friend and I stayed with Andre and Johanna for several nights and loved our experience. They went above and beyond as accommodating hosts to make sure we had great recommendations for Stockholm, work around our travel schedules, and even met us for a great dinner. They are both extremely personal and hospitable. Their flat is well-decorated, spacious, and clean, and they will make you feel at home. The location is perfect--You really get the best of both worlds with a quiet, hip neighborhood, but are also 2 min walk to the subway and an easy walk to the big sites at Gamla Stan. We are so grateful we chose to stay with Andre and Johanna."
556363,83899895,2016-07-04T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment was as beautiful as in the pictures! The location was great, Vasastan is a really lovely neighbourhood with many nice restaurants and cafés.

242188,426223969,2019-03-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Great location just in the center. Li is an outstanding host, she gave me lots of tips to make my trip easier. She has arranged great amenities in the living room upstairs, you have everything more than you need., so you just feel home. Highly recommended.!"

757320,41604738,2015-08-08T00:00:00.000Z,"The appartement is very well located in stockholms hipster area, sôdermalm. It was clean and the room was Nice. Barb is very warm & welcoming."
819676,95256007,2016-08-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Amazing penthouse apartment with your own bedroom and bathroom! Andy and Vannie were outstanding hosts - they were really accommodating, friendly, and generous. They made sure that I had everything I needed and they even went so far as to arrange travel for me to the airport when I was struggling to do so on my own (and made sure that I got there ok!). They are really wonderful."
581243,62332894,2016-02-14T00:00:00.000Z,"The room in Edwin's house was beautiful, and just as shown in the picture. The house is centrally located and 10-15 mins walking distance to the area where all the museums are located. It is also near the old Stockholm area (gamla stan) by metro (less than ten mins by metro). Edwin kindly gave the directions to his house and travel details very very clearly and we had absolutely no problem reaching the place."
313763,101972720,2016-09-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Martin's place was just as described, lovely with a great location. He was also nice enough to pick us up from the train station when our flight was delayed and we arrived later than expected. Recommended."

Overall a good place to stay - however if you are hoping to make any food, the kitchenette is basic with no sink and no surface to prepare food (I used the desk in the bedroom). Also Karl mentioned he is hoping to install a shower cubicle which will be a great addition as currently the arrangement means the bathroom floor gets a bit like a swimming pool when you use the shower."

Everything you need in one place, you don't have to hesitate one more second, and more over Daniel is a very friendly and attentive host !

Thank you for everything !"
700113,75865804,2016-05-23T00:00:00.000Z,Ilona is a gracious host and studio is just as pictured.  Location is excellent - quick access to public transport and everything I needed was in walking distance.  Kitchen has all essentials and there are three grocery stores nearby.  Wifi worked well.
700113,78782796,2016-06-09T00:00:00.000Z,The studio was neat and tidy and clean. The location is about a 7 minute walk from the metro station in a quiet name and across from a park. It was peaceful and felt like home.

The area feels extremely safe and it was easy to get to by local public transports.
We would definitely recommend this place to all other airbnb travellers."

1212891,6316761,2013-08-07T00:00:00.000Z,"I stayed in Maud's apartment for two nights. She responded quickly and was friendly and helpful. The room and bed were nice and tidy and Maud provided clean towels for showering and in case I wanted to go swimming. She didn't want to give me a key to the house since I was unreviewed on Airbnb (I'm not sure why?!), so instead we just agreed on a time frame during which I would arrive, so that wasn't a problem. She also gave me a (rather large) discount to make up for the inconvenience. The area is beautiful with lots of parks and a long amazing waterfront boardwalk with an assortment of bars and restaurants, and I ended up just strolling around for hours. It's perfect walking distance from the city centre if you're not in a hurry. Recommended!"
647314,93613290,2016-08-13T00:00:00.000Z,Our stay at Mallika's apartment was great. The location is perfect for exploring Stockholm and Södermalm. Mallika was very friendly and we would definitely recommend staying at her place!
1149820,37805625,2015-07-10T00:00:00.000Z,"I spent three nights in Klara's wonderful studio-apartment with my girlfriend. The listing is nothing short of perfect for couples visiting Stockholm. 
The studio is exactly as seen in the pictures. The flat is beautifully decorated and a shining example of how to decorate a studio apartment where space is limited. 
The flat is located a nice 4 minute walk from Hornstull metro, in a quiet spot right next to a couple of parks. 
Klara was very nice and easy to communicate with. I would not hesitate one moment to book this listing again. Thank you Klara"
1212891,271060927,2018-05-31T00:00:00.000Z,"It's a small apartment from sixties in a good location, just a bit away from Metro station (about 6-11 min walk, depends to green or blue line). There is a nice beach area close by, with many fashion clubs and bars.  Maud is very friendly, she tries that your stay would be very comfortable. Coffee, shampoo, oil and similar daily things are provided.   Recommend."

688947,14519263,2014-06-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Alexandre's flat was very conveniently located, just a few minute walk from the t-banna. The neighborhood is very quiet, so getting a goodnight's sleep is no problem. Alexandre was very nice, provided maps, and gave us some museum recommendations. Also, there are two grocery stores nearby!"
1182616,93235682,2016-08-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Host did make us feel welcome, the listing was accurate, but the apartment can have several guests staying at once and one bathroom with 8 people is extremely challenging. If you were on a strict schedule you might not have time to get a shower that morning. Kitchen was a little messy but could have been do to all the house guests."
700113,16395997,2014-07-27T00:00:00.000Z,die Lage war gut für einen Schwedentrip und von der Größe hat's für zwei gut gepasst. Süße kleine Küche :) Die Gastgeberin war auch freundlich und wohnte direkt nebenan. Jedoch nicht zu empfehlen bei Katzenhaarallergie.. Ansonsten stimmt wohl das Preis/Leistungsverhältnis !
1212891,9771575,2014-01-09T00:00:00.000Z,Maud is very charming women! She has cozy flat where we felt as at home. Everything required was in the kitchen and room. Her cats are very friendly and positive. Thank you very much.
343925,6782849,2013-08-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Stockholm has turned out to be one of my favorite places to visit, fresh, clean, and interesting. Annika's apartment was equally as pleasant for us. It was easy to find, very clean, close to food stores and other shopping, easy access to public transportation, and she is quick to communicate. There is a plethora of tourist information available at her place. She met us on arrival at the apartment, showed us around, and answered our questions. There are washers and dryers in the basement that can be used at certain times, which is very convenient.

We arrived at Arlanda airport and took the bus into town, it is the least expensive way to travel to town and probably as fast as the train. It also has free wireless which was good enough to make (Hidden by Airbnb) calls with while we headed downtown. You get off the bus at St. Eriksplan and can walk to the apartment in about 10 minutes, or take the metro right from the bus stop to within two or three blocks of the apartment. As an alternative a cab from St. Eriksplan charges about 90 kroner.

There is a great Pakistan restaurant on Sankt Eriksgatan between Annika's apartment and the St. Eriksplan bus stop, called \"Little Pakistan\" --- definitely worth a visit.

We loved walking from Annika's across to the pedestrian shopping street which leads all the way into the old city, where you find many interesting sights including the royal palace, Pulitzer Museum, and numerous places to eat and drink.

Thanks Annika, hope to see you again."
1117037,222648934,2017-12-30T00:00:00.000Z,The apartment is close to the metro therefore its really easy to get anywhere. Polina and her friend were very helpful and nice. I had a great times staying there!

1124388,5150645,2013-06-15T00:00:00.000Z,"My fiancé and I had such a lovely time in Stockholm while staying at Carl's place. It's located on a really cool little island (30 minutes to casually walk the shoreline path) with some very nice apartments on it, and even some little shops and docks. Everyone there speaks english, (better than many of my friends, in fact), and they are all very helpful. The (#1) bus stop is right around the corner. The place itself is compact, but efficient, warm, and inviting. Carl even has some vinyl records available which truly set the right mood. That was a fun memorable surprise. Would happily visit and stay again! Thanks Carl!"

541875,2171624,2012-09-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Highly recommended. The apartment is nice, comfortable and well equipped, and connections to Stockholm central station and main attractions are excellent. Martin is the kindest and most helpful host you can imagine, and it was a real pleasure to meet him in person.  Also, as he wasn't there when we arrived, he arranged for a friend of his and her husband to meet  us at the station, and they too were very nice and helpful. It was a great stay, and I would definitely try and book the place again if I go back to Stockholm."

El apartamento es muy amplio y dispone de una cocina muy equipada. El barrio está a 15 minutos en metro de la estación central, en un entorno muy tranquilo. Te mimetizas con la cultura sueca totalmente.

Lo recomendamos, sin lugar a dudas."

The location really couldn't be better - just a couple blocks from both the metro as well as wonderful bakeries, coffee shops, restaurants and boutiques...not to mention great pedestrian paths and parks. The studio was very clean and tidy, and Annika made efforts to ensure my stay was pleasant and that I had everything I needed without being an overbearing presence. I would highly recommend Annika's studio and I hope to stay again whenever I return to Stockholm."

Unsere Reise war recht spontan, Anette hat aber immer ganz schnell reagiert und so hatten wir in kürzester Zeit eine tolle Unterkunft. Die Wohnung ist wirklich schön und man fühlt sich sofort wie bei einer Freundin zu Hause. Die Umgebung ist sehr schön (viele Cafes, entspannte Leute etc.) und genau der richtig Startpunkt für eine Stockholm-Erkundung. 
Alles in allem: perfekt! Ich würde jederzeit gerne wieder bei Anette ein Wochenende in Stockholm verbringen!"

The balcony is a particularly nice feature because it opens up the space. We walked easily or used our SL card to get everywhere. Daniel is a very welcoming host and accommodated our need to arrive unexpectedly late at the apartment. We recommend staying here for anyone interested in easy access to sightseeing and to the Sodermalm area."

Majken made check-in and check-out effortless and gave us a long list of tasty restaurant recommendations."
1170766,12479349,2014-05-03T00:00:00.000Z,"I had the great pleasure of staying at Annika's studio in Stockholm. My trip was arranged in the last minute, so I had very little time to plan my stay. Luckily Annika responded very quickly to my request and was able to accept my request and receive me all within the same day! Communication was swift and easy and the studio itself is really nice, bright and clean, with a little kitchen so you can prepare yourself some lunch or dinner and enjoy it on the terrace in the sun!
Location is also great - at Mariaberget - within walking distance of everything, and if you prefer to take the metro, you will find Mariatorget station just two blocks away.
Access from the airport is super easy as well. 
If you are thinking about staying at Annika's - don't hesitate, it is a great base to stay at when you are visiting Stockholm!"
916806,163062991,2017-06-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Julia's place is a lovely, spacious and bright apartment. It is in a lovely, vibrant and multi-cultural area that has many different restaurants, a huge mall, a lidl and prisma grocery shop and market with fresh fruits and vegetables nearby and a train station about 15 minutes away walking.The kitchen is well equipped and was perfect for a short stay for 2-3/4 at a max people as it is a studio apartment with one double bed and one couch that pulls out to a double. The surroundings of the apartment are lovely and there is a generous sized patio with picnic bench furniture to sit out and enjoy the sun in. The train is the best way to get into Stockholm central and takes approx 25 minutes."

723539,4861252,2013-05-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Two of us stayed in Mathias's excellent apartment and it was a great base to explore the beautiful city.  Everything you could want is there (although wifi a bit temperamental - try sitting by the window).  Mathias was very accommodating, we were late to arrive (thanks Heathrow!) and then had a later flight, so were able to leave luggage to pick up later.  Communication with Mathias was first rate, he made us feel welcome and gave good insight into what to make the most of while in the city."

Maud is a very accommodating host, who made us feel totally welcome. Her hosting experience is demonstrated by her organisation, she really had thought of every possible little thing we might need

Sammy (cat) was also a very friendly host, which made us feel 'at home'

We would definitely recommend this place"

El apartamento perfecto de tamaño, con todo lo que necesitabamos y una decoración muy cuidada. El barrio no es el centro turístico sino más el barrio joven y cool de la ciudad, que es lo que buscábamos. Súper bien conectado con transporte público (bus y metro)."
1212891,14076676,2014-06-11T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a great stay at Maud's place. It is a beautifully light and airy apartment, very comfortable and immaculately clean.  Very nice location and neighbourhood.  Maud was a lovely host, friendly, welcoming and thoughtful (she even gave me some herbal tea and honey when I was ill) and helpful with information for our visit to Stockholm  We also loved her sweet and friendly cats.  We would definitely consider staying with her again when we visit Stockholm in the future."
1261445,89071204,2016-07-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Apartment is just as described. Very comfortably fitted out and in very convenient location. Kitchen had all mod cons, lounge and bedroom areas both very comfortable and apartment was very clean. The bathroom is small as described but works fine. Marie- Louise was also very generous with the food she provided for us and we were met by her daughter who was very helpful showing us around the apartment and directing us to local restaurants etc. The airport bus is even just around the corner. Would definitely recommend the apartment."
1038408,18954649,2014-09-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Kristoffer is a really nice guy. We met him for the key delivery and had a pleasant talk. He told us where important things are and gave us some groceries on house. 
Kristoffer's home is really lovely and classy arranged with a pretty well equipped kitchen and a big living room (with an Apple TV, iPod docking station and a lot of books) with a dining area for four people. 
The bathroom ist not the latest - but for my girlfriend an me totally adequate. 
Just the bed was too small and soft for our 7 day stay - but this is a matter of opinion. 
Also brilliant was the short walk to the metro. It's just 500m away. 

All in all: the perfect home for a short stay in beautiful Stockholm! Commendable!"
1271843,226932930,2018-01-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Fantastic location, close to a brilliant chocolate shop and the best bakery in Stockholm, Petrus.

He even stocked the refrigerator with a few items. The house itself was large and could easily fit far more than the two people who stayed there.
755843,188008058,2017-08-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Apartment: this was our first time staying in an Airbnb that is used as a primary residence. It was like staying in your uncle's bachelor pad. Not a beautiful place to relax and spend time, but a good place to come back to sleep that is safe, comfortable and spacious. A big bedroom and two bathrooms were a plus. It was clean and the pictures were accurate. 

Location: it's not walkable from anywhere unless you really love to walk a lot. Bus was about 10 minutes from the central station, other sites were 20-30+ minutes by bus and tram. This is a residential area and there isn't a lot close by, so this is a quieter neighborhood away from the tourists.

Communication was very easy, and we were pleased with our stay overall."

La casa ha molto carattere, è particolare, piena di oggetti e mobili relativi ai suoi viaggi e la sua vita. Pulita. Spaziosa e ideale per 3/4 persone, avendo sue bagni.
Si trova a sud di Stoccolma, 5/10 min a piedi dalla metro e dal supermercato, in un contesto residenziale e tranquillo, nel verde.
L'appartamento è molto fornito di tutto (solo ricordatevi di portare un asciugacapelli!), Christian ci ha addirittura comprato un seggiolone Ikea per la nostra bimba.

The area seemed to be very up and coming and the apartment is just a 2 minute walk from a direct subway line into the city which with a 7 day pass is a bargin for any European capital. I would recommend this apartment to anyone looking for a place to stay that is close enough to the city to enjoy the attractions in the day and the nightlife in the evening, but away from the tourist crowds so you feel like you can really be a part of the live of Stockholm.

343925,9551977,2014-01-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Our stay at Annika's flat was very enjoyable and coming \"home\" felt good every time. Annika is a lovely host, she was not in town during our stay, but always available and provided useful advice in various ways to make sure we do not miss a thing. She is the first person I would contact if I got another chance to visit Stockholm (definitely worth a trip in spring/summer, too ;o) or recommend to friends travelling there. One of the reasons I loved the place was the comfy bed. Being in a quiet neighborhood and yet just a few steps away from lots of shops, buses and Underground was prettyj close to priceless, too. Thanx again&GOTT NYTT ÅR! to our friendly host."
723539,7593314,2013-09-25T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a great stay at Mathias' apartment. It is very nice, especially because being on the top floor gives it good light and it has a balcony. Mathias is very organized and everything went smoothly. (Note: there is no internet/wifi...) The location is pretty great, very close to many things."
1182616,17710994,2014-08-16T00:00:00.000Z,This was our first trip to beautiful Stockholm and Peter greeted us at his BnB with friendly hospitality.  Peter's BnB is everything as advertised and in a great location within walking distance of many great places to visit in Stockholm. Parking is convenient. It's a popular BnB and other BnB guests may also be occupying the BnB during your stay. I would recommend this BnB to anyone visiting Stockholm.
242188,37644322,2015-07-09T00:00:00.000Z,Lidia was caring and solicitous of my needs. I enjoyed my chats with her. The bed was possibly the most comfortable I've slept on during my four week trip. The location was very handy. I'd recommend a stay at Lidia's to anyone.
338470,25174570,2015-01-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Gustav is a very nice guy, a lot of thanks to him. The apartment is clean and bright. Everything looks just as beautiful as it actually is. Gustav is a really creative man, he's got wonderful taste in little things, it all made his apartment a great, cozy and interesting place where you would lose yourself for a week, reading books about contamporary art and design, playing music (he has a guitar and some other stuff), cooking food (there is a shop near the house). Also it took us just 15 minutes to walk to the Downtown. Thanks, Gustav."
1170027,5317715,2013-06-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Fantastic apartment, only a few minutes walk from the subway station. Only 20 minutes from Central Station. Lovely balcony & fully equipped kitchen (inc Coffee Maker). 
We used the pull out bed from the sofa as it was a Double - this was very comfortable & easy to fold away during the day - there is also a single bed in the apartment. Met Diana on our last day in Stockholm, she was extremely helpful & very quick to reply to our messages throughout the whole Airbnb experience. 
Thanks so much :)"

1244657,13236022,2014-05-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Usha and Gaithri were warm, welcoming hosts, despite us rarely getting to see each other. The flat could not be in a better location. The room is larger than it looks in the photos and very cute. I'm still not over that incredible rainbow chandelier. It's also nicely situated so you feel a bit less terrible when you're dragging all of your bags to the front door at 3:30 am. I wish we'd had more time to chat! Thanks for a very comfortable stay!"
688947,79522597,2016-06-13T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed at Alexandres apartment for two nights and it was as good as described. Very clean and nice, and also very quiet and peaceful. A few minutes walk to the T-station, and from there around 10-20 minutes to the center of town, depending on where you want to go. Communication with Alexandre was good and clear. He also let us use his parking place, which was very valuable to us! I would definitely recommend Alexandre as a host."

1182616,8956281,2013-11-28T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment is in a very good location, a block from the Fridhemsplan T-bana stop, with easy access to shops, restaurants, etc. The room itself is large, with a very nice porch with a view of the sunrise, and the bed is comfortable. The kitchen is more modestly equipped than I've found in other places, and nothing was provided (not even tea), but that's more about lack of clarity than a fault. It's also important to note that this is one of two rooms that are rented out, and the other, which can accommodate more people, happened to be occupied by a rather messy group when I arrived, so the kitchen was a mess and the flat smelled like a college dorm. The next day everything was tidied up. I never did meet Peter, but he was very pleasant and prompt in his replies via email. So... a mixed experience, but generally good."
145320,315286870,2018-08-28T00:00:00.000Z,"If you visit Stockholm and want a perfect room at a perfect location: don’t hesitate. Kim’s apartment is gorgeous, close to every interesting part of the town.

Thank you for everything Kim."
608672,210807112,2017-11-11T00:00:00.000Z,"It's an independent studio but you will see that it's originally a room of a bigger apartment.  In the studio, there are two doors that connect to the original apartment where Karl lives.  You will hear him and his wife talking through the doors.  However, it has not been any problem for me as I'm just in and out to take a shower and sleep.  The location is absolutely superb and this is quite central and close to many restaurants and bars.  Also, just 5min walk to a subway station, from which you can get to most places in Stockholm under 15-20 minutes.  I'd definitely stay at this place again."
299154,76313901,2016-05-26T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment was really nice and confortable for 3-4 people. The location was perfect. Close to metro station and in a neighbourhood full of shops, cafes and bars. I would recommend the apartment and I would visit Daniel again."
533880,37761579,2015-07-10T00:00:00.000Z,"I stayed at Jarls house but he wasn't there for the week I was there, so we never met! However he was so generous whilst I was there, communicating with me and ensuring I had everything I needed.

Place is in a great location, close to Karlaplan trains which take you on a 5min journey to Central where you can start Stockholm exploring! 

Room was as described, quiet, calm and perfect size for a traveller. Bed was reasonably comfy too. 

Would stay again. Thanks Jarl!"
819676,308332843,2018-08-16T00:00:00.000Z,Lovely hosts. Spotless flat. Central location - in quiet street. Super bedroom with a very nice shower rom. I felt I could be as private - or as convivial as I wished!

Everything you need is clearly organized for you upon arrival and you are within a few minutes walk to fantastic shops, restaurants, bars, parks, and of course the subway.  It's a warm and welcoming home with great design. We will recommend Madeleine's apartment to our friends! You will not be disappointed!!"

The neighbourhood is absolutely lovely, lots to see and discover!

Although we did not meet in person, Paulina and Tom were wonderful hosts who made us feel very welcome. Smooth and direct communication, tips for the neighbourhood and the city, a written guide to the apartment and even treats for us in the fridge! It couldn't be better, thank you guys!"

Some essential rules about noise and privacy to respect, which seems logical to anyone who share one's home. The adress is at few minutes from metro, shops and 20mn by walk from the main sites of the city (Gamla Stan, Soder', Central Station, Djurgarden...) And as you want to be as healthy as swedish people, you walk!
Lotta has been adorable, very helpful, and answering any of my questions, giving essential advices and good adresses when I came.
A really nice stay for me, who was working and visiting. Thanks for everything."

Jesper and Sofie made sure that we knew exactly how to get to the flat and greeted us upon arrival - walking through everything we needed to know and make sure all our questions were answered.  They were so welcoming and kind.

The flat is in a beautiful, quiet location - close to the metro and many amenities.  It was safe and extremely clean.  The flat itself is absolutely beautiful and we felt at home during our stay.  

Jesper and Sofie were available throughout our holiday in case we had any questions or needed anything additional.  They were so kind and helpful.

A wonderful holiday and a wonderful flat.  We would look forward to staying there again if in Stockholm."

It can be a little noisier since it's part of a hostel, but when you keep the window closed, it won't bother you. The atmosphere of the hostel is really nice, and the breakfast you can buy was great. Location is amazing, within 5-10 minutes (walking) you're in the busiest shoppingstreets of Stockholm. Lastly, as the other reviews said, the sauna and laundry room aren't part of the apartment, but don't let that deter you from renting this space. Me and my colleagues loved our stay here."
1182616,14208137,2014-06-14T00:00:00.000Z,One friend and myself stayed here for around 5 days and had a lovely time! The flat was clean and comfortable and Peter was super helpful and accommodating.

Lidia is very welcoming, anticipates your needs, gives you the right amount of privacy, is very well-travelled and knowledgeable, and gives great tips on getting around the city.  Her home is located in a fairly central neighbourhood, a 5-10 minute easy walk from the metro and commuter trains. The area is bustling in the evenings, with lots of restaurants and bars.  The old town is a 15 minute walk away. The room was clean and quiet, and the bed very comfortable.  I got back very late each night and that's not a problem as long as you are respectful of the other guests and don't make any noise. Walking back late at night was also completely safe. There are 3-4 rooms located off the first floor landing, including a bathroom which everyone shares and which is very clean. There are shared tea/coffee making facilities and Lidia was very accommodating in providing me with the use of an iron and ironing board.  Breakfast is very generous. Overall, a great B&B."

The apartment is in a good location, a few minutes walk to the metro station for two lines and the bus stops are also nearby. There is a shopping mall and supermarkets are also nearby.

The flat is clean, spacious, and well-decorated in a laid-back modern theme. The shower and bathroom were very nice. The room and bed are a bit small, which is perfect if you're traveling by yourself, but I would be careful if you are extra tall or if you're traveling with another person. That said, the room was perfect for me ;)"

Excellent, prompt, clear communication, very fair price, well located neighborhood and gracious hostess.  We loved the apartment decor.  While it is a smaller space, the space is well utilized and it does not feel cramped.  Marie-Louise kindly provided breakfast and snacks, and her daughter Bianca was exceedingly helpful in showing us around the space and orienting us to the city.  If you like to walk there is a lovely path to stroll that leads to Gamla Stan, with great scenic views along the way.  Transportation, restaurants and food markets are all right nearby.  We would stay here again in a heartbeat, and highly recommend it to others!"
608672,110283720,2016-10-25T00:00:00.000Z,Karl was great! He was waiting outside of the elevator when we arrived to let us in to the apartment.

Södermalm is a nice area to stay in with lots of cafes, little shops and greenery all on the doorstep. It is also well connected which makes it easy to get to the center of the city.

Emma and her family were very attentive and made sure that we had a comfortable stay by checking with us if everything was going well and if we needed anything.

I can highly recommend the apartment to anyone wishing to visit Stockholm!"

You get some amount of city noise from the outside with the windows open, but the building itself is very quiet. The apartment was immaculate and provided everything we needed: a comfy bed for two and a hot shower. Groups of more than two or those wanting to cook themselves a sitdown meal everyday may find it on the minimal side. Note that the building has a tiny elevator that says it can fit three but can probably only fit one with luggage. We mostly walked the four flights up and down.

1271843,312242837,2018-08-23T00:00:00.000Z,"André’s place was fantastic! The apartment was extremely clean, cozy, and he provided us with anything we could need. Easy to find as it is right around the corner from a metro station - André gave very clear directions on how to find his home as well. His communication was GREAT, we could reach out whenever necessary and he would reply almost immediately! 
We loved his apartment, if we find ourselves in Stockholm again we are for sure staying with him!"
1189469,43495525,2015-08-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Unfortunately there was no welcome, no note with some instructions. But once we were settled we felt at home in this light, spacious, comfortable and beautiful appartement. It is on a perfect location in a very nice neighborhood to explore Stockholm."
954832,494486455,2019-07-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Apartment very comfortable, practical: close to subway, buses. Pretty close to the center. In a beautiful and calm area. Supermarkets are so close too.
There is all travelers need inside the apartment of building.
Mickael is a very kind man, smiling and so welcoming. He’s fast replying to messages, helping you out when it’s need.
Such a pleasure to stay at his place to visit Stockholm."
1184553,519374382,2019-08-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Everything as expected - clean place with great location and the host responding fast. We appreciate Annbritt let us check in much later (because of rescheduled flight) and we could leave our luggage there until the afternoon and pick it up just before leaving to the airport. What I didnt like was the bed - too soft so I could barely sleep. But that is just a matter of one ´s preference. I ´ve had much warmer hosts in the past, but that is a matter of personal preference, too."
1182616,279247093,2018-06-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Quick and easy response to making a reservation. Hospitable man. Available for questions. Loved meeting Peter and Milo. Sorry about the confusion about the keys. Once we knew, no problem!!  Thank you."
1212891,70379753,2016-04-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Just spent one day and a half, but we felt like in our home. Maud was always really nice, very helpful in everything we need. The room is really confortable. Really nice walk to the old town."
1212891,87144438,2016-07-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud was a really nice host who does everything to make you feel comfortable. Her two cats are lovely.
The apartment is very clean and as a guest you get a lot of extra space in the kitchen and bathroom. 
We stayed for two nights and we would recommend Maud's place!"
819676,239059856,2018-02-28T00:00:00.000Z,This is an amazing apartment close to the main tourist attractions in Stockholm.  It is easy to reach from the airport and central train station.

170651,455823624,2019-05-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Mein Freund und ich verbrachten ein verlängertes Wochenende in Maries kleinen aber netten und sauberen Apartment. Die Wohnung ist mit allem ausgestattet, was man braucht und insbesondere der Balkon ist ein Highlight. Die Kommunikation mit Marie verlief einwandfrei und die Lage der Wohnung hat uns gut gefallen. Zum einen gibt es einige Läden direkt um die Ecke, zum anderen ist die Anbindung an die öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln und auch zum Flughafen super. 
Auch wenn wir große Katzenliebhaber sind, empfanden wir die nächtliche Aktivität des sonst sehr liebenswerten Katers (welcher auf Wunsch aber vielleicht nicht anwesend ist) als störend, insbesondere da es keine Tür zum Schlafzimmer gibt."
954832,151346444,2017-05-12T00:00:00.000Z,Mikael was so great in helping us get settled.  Answered our numerous questions and if he didn't know the answer he looked it up for us. His place was completely spotless and organized and we had everything we needed even coffee in the morning. His communication was amazing and we never felt we were far from somebody that could help. The subway was less than two blocks away as was a very large grocery store.  The breakfast shop was across the street and at least three restaurants within one block. We will definitely come back to his place.
916806,298403611,2018-07-29T00:00:00.000Z,"This is a great flat in a beautiful and quiet suburb of Stockholm. The proximity of the beach is a plus. The view is lovely from Julia's garden. Although Julia wasn't there to welcome us the instructions for getting to the flat were meticulous and we had no trouble finding the place or getting in. Overall, a very happy stay in Skärholmen."
164448,44494204,2015-08-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Our trip to Stockholm was made perfect because Lidia was our host. Her warm and welcoming generosity was felt the moment we arrived at her apartment. She brought us in, gave us coffee and tea, and went through maps and guidebooks on all the best things to do in Stockholm. Her apartment is beautiful, warm, and perfectly clean. If I'm ever in Stockholm again I will certainly look to stay with Lidia."
1124388,27106487,2015-02-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Carl was a great host. Even though we arrived earlier than agreed, it was no problem. Everything was smoothly arranged and we enjoyed our stay very much.
Carl's apartement is small, but very comfortable and you have there everything you need starting from cooking equipment and finishing with internet. Plus one can spend endless time just admiring his amazing book collection. Place is also very well located for exploring Stockholm. There is frequent public transport connection and in case of nice weather you can actually even walk to the center when you feel a bit more sporty.
So we enjoyed our stay in Carl's flat wery much :)"

1156474,5675817,2013-07-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Our family of four (children aged 9 and 11) had a very comfortable stay in Jenny's home.  In comparison to other vacation flats that we have rented over the years we found Jenny's to be quite spacious for our family of four.  It was well located - in a quiet neighborhood with cafes and shops and close to public transportation.  It's a short walk to the nearest bus stop which takes you into town and just two blocks from the ferry dock.  One of our favorite experiences was visiting the local lake (just about a mile walk) for a swim where there was also a small beach and a cafe.  Jenny provided us with directions to the lake.

Jenny and her husband were very considerate hosts.  They were responsive over email and helped us reserve time in the laundry room.  Thank you Jenny!"
283446,1692272,2012-07-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Vidhi and Bala are amazing hosts.
I felt at home from the first moment.

They are very helpful and generous. The internet access + washing machine access helped me a lot during my trip to Scandinavia as well.

Lovely family and a very nice place. The location is great too, because it's like one minute walking from the metro station, and from there it's really quick to get to the main attractions in Stockholm. 
Food was really good too.

It was my first Airbnb experience, and it was not less than an excellent one. I am really glad I stayed at Comfort Stay @ Stockholm - Kista IT."
954832,153965749,2017-05-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Michael´s place is absolutely fantastic, very well located, quiet, full with nice details and he and his wife are kind are helpful when needed. I spent an unforgettable week in Stockholm and part of it was staying in this amazing place, I totally recommend it."
1212891,131699650,2017-02-13T00:00:00.000Z,Maud and Sammy are wondeful hosts. Our room and the appartment was very comfortable and everything was really well organized.  The neigborhood is nice and calm and we can get into the center in 15 minutes our less even by bus. It was a perfect decision to ask Maud to be our host.
954832,26687113,2015-02-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Staying at Mikael's apartment in Stockholm was a wonderful experience. We couldn't have been in a better neighborhood - it was quiet and easy to get around. The apartment itself was very cozy, clean, and just the right place for our 10 day stay. Mikeal was a perfect host - helpful and open, greeted and showed us around the apartment, even taking time to look over a map of Stockholm with us and give recommendations. I highly recommend you stay here, another wonderful AirBnB experience. Thanks Mikael!"
1204621,278602563,2018-06-18T00:00:00.000Z,Nettanin hyväkuntoinen koti sijaitsee rauhallisella ja vehreällä alueella meren läheisyydessä. Liikenneyhteydet keskustaan olivat todella hyvät. Nettanilta sai aina tarvittaessa vinkkejä ajanviettoon ja liikkumiseen Tukholmassa. Viihdyin todella hyvin!
1248490,39142178,2015-07-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Het is een schitterend appartement met daarin alles beschikbaar. 
Het appartement is gelegen in een mooie buurt, waar je veel restaurantjes, winkels en de metro om het hart van Stockholm te gaan ontdekken.

Kortom een ideaal appartement met fantastisch uitzicht en genoeg ruimte voor 4 personen."

Even though I arrived very late at night, Nic waited up to let me in and show me everything. The flat is in a perfect location for visiting Stockholm, and the space is comfortable and large enough for a single traveler. Wifi and working space was also good for the times I needed to log on to work. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Stockholm. Nic and Usha, thanks so much and enjoy all of your summer travels!"
647314,147720852,2017-04-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Très bon accueil, souplesse concernant l'horaire d'arrivée et la récupération des clés.
Mallika nous a donné de bonne adresses pour sortir."
1182616,309470185,2018-08-18T00:00:00.000Z,"L'appartement est situé dans un quartier sympa. Mais la façon dont les hôtes sont traités, à savoir comme du bétail à faire de l'argent à la chaîne, ne donne pas vraiment envie de rester dans l'appartement. La salle de bain était sale à mon arrivée, et l'est restée pendant 48h (toilettes avec tâches douteuses dans et sur le bord de la cuvette). Des serviettes, certainement des hôtes précédents, amoncelées dans un coin. Des meubles entreposés, un lit dans le corridor déjà étroit, un autre meuble coincé dans un côté de la cuisine, elle aussi déjà étroite : pas d'espace commun à proprement dit. 1 salle de bain (avec toilettes) pour 3 chambres pouvant accueillir jusqu'à 6 personnes. Une usine donc, à faire de l'argent sur le dos des jeunes, rien de très charmant pour passer des vacances, ni pour un voyage professionnel comme c'était mon cas."
274876,41070793,2015-08-04T00:00:00.000Z,"We had such a lovely time and felt at home in this central apartment! Great wifi, clean and modern and incredibly comfortable beds! They were like marshmallows which is so important when traveling for long periods. Emma was very flexible with check in and available when I had any questions. The washing facilities were great! Super comfortable stay! Definitely recommend"
1124388,7014781,2013-09-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Great little apartment with separate cosy kitchen with dining table and chairs which was nice bonus! Bigger than it looks in the photos.
Very easy to get into town with regular bus service every 5-10mins which ran into early hours or 30 minute walk through parks and along shore front. The bus stop is literally a 20 meter walk from the building entrance and stops right outside the central bus and train station (where the Airport bus drops you off!). 
There is a small supermarket opposite which was well stocked and couple of takeaways. We tried the one a couple of doors down and it was great. 
Carl left us some really nice things for breakfast, including some traditional Swedish break knakebrot which we wouldn't have tried otherwise. Carl was really friendly and a great host. He answered all our questions by e-mail before we arrived and met us to show how things worked and also left left us information about Stockholm and a bike card."
723539,125343475,2017-01-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Great apartment, centrally located, comfortable pull out couch in the living room! We had a great time in Stockholm."
1204621,71918797,2016-04-29T00:00:00.000Z,Nettan is an excellent host and she's hosting a nice place in quiet Gärdet in Stockholm. There's a ICA convenience store 5 min away and a really big ICA 10 min away. It's a short walk to the subway or the # 1 bus and you'll be in the center really fast. The bathroom is very nice with capabilities to do laundry. Everything is nice clean tidy and modern. I enjoyed our conversations very much and I would highly recommend this place if you don't need to live right smack in the middle of Stockholm!
1158893,366046314,2019-01-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Great place for big company, we enjoyed our stay very much. House is clean and is equipped with everything you need."
536691,5204844,2013-06-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Cecilia's flat seems to be one that is frequently available in Stockholm.  It was a relief being accepted by her after several others responded that they were going to be using their flats at the time we would be in Stockholm.   The rooms in this flat are spacious and light filled.  The bed was the most comfortable in our whole three week travels through Scandinavia.  The elevator was a big help in getting our luggage into and back out of the building.  The nice marble spiral staircase was not a problem when we weren't carrying heavy loads even with the apartment up 4 flights - and we are seniors.  Another convenience we appreciated was the laundry facility in the basement, though it took some guessing to figure out how to work the machines since we don't know Swedish.  Cecilia had a newly opened box of laundry detergent in the flat which was a big help once we found it.  We needed so little and didn't want to have to buy a whole box.  We also liked having recycling and trash disposal on the ground floor. The Coop grocery store nearby carried organic food selections which was important to us, and a good bakery was next door to it.  Having our breakfast and evening meal in the flat saved us lots of money.  Transportation around the city was very easy from here by subway.  All in all it was a very pleasant and convenient place to stay in Stockholm."
647314,32118508,2015-05-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Mallika lives in a very beautiful flat. The room to be rent is big and nice, the bed is very comfortable. Mallika was very helpful and hospitable. I enjoyed my stay there a lot and would book her room again when travelling to Stockholm again."
283446,32901459,2015-05-23T00:00:00.000Z,"A nice welcome from Vidharti where one can find a home away from home. Vidharti is very active in any type of response either message or sms or phone call and you can get any possible help from her. I hope one can enjoy the stay with nice family.
What is described here one can find the same there. You will surely feel self as a part of family. If possible and get a chance don't miss the enjoyment of traditional food."
299154,5552842,2013-07-05T00:00:00.000Z,Great location in Stockholm and an excellent alternative for a 2-4 person hostel. All the amenities of home including a well stocked kitchen albeit small. Daniel's sister met us to hand off keys and was quick to make us feel at home. I would stay again anytime.

The communication was always quick and good with Annika and she made us feel very welcome. She left some fruit for us and the apartment was very clean. She even gave us umbrellas for a heavy rainy day.
We’ll stay again if we are in Stockholm. Thanks!"

Die Wohnung bietet alles, was man für ein Wochenende braucht. Der Kontakt via email mit Madeleine war bestens, auch der self check-in klappte problemlos."
954832,473788446,2019-06-22T00:00:00.000Z,Great cosy flat in good location for metro or bus travel and lovely walk along riverside to centre. Mikael very welcoming and could not have been more helful.  Highly recommended.
819676,133562607,2017-02-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Andy and Vannie's place is really well located. You'll find restaurants, bars, shops and nice sightseeing in the area . Really close to the old part of the city at a short walking distance, metro stations around, etc. They're lovely to provide with maps and guides of the city, and give suggestions according to your needs. We had a nice stay in their flat."
170651,495351,2011-09-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice location, well equipped kitchen, nice sunny balcony. 
If you are travelling with a small baby, as we did, it is good to know that the elevator is rather small. Our baby carriage did not fit in (unless dismounted), which was a bit impractical.
Also, from the practical standpoint, we would have liked a normal size table and some more electric light (instead of the many candles), but I suppose this is a question of taste."
871262,16174456,2014-07-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Lotta is a great hostess. She has so many information and tips about Stockholm and also areas further away. You should definitely make use of her guidance.
The 'small' room is absolutely ok, everything is clean, neat and as described.
The same time as me another airbnb guest stayed in the huge flat but I didn't hear anything of him, we only met twice in the hallway.
As I was there on a weekend, I could easily park my car in front of the house."
206221,190895857,2017-09-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Well, where to begin? Firstly, if you're wanting to stay in Stockholm, please ignore this review and book this place. 

Södermalm is the place to be in Stockholm. Elizabeth's place is a traditionally designed and decorated Swedish apartment. Situated down a beautiful allé, and not far from the T-bana, shops, and restaurants all catering to your needs. No need to even catch the train - you can walk to Gamla Stan (Old Town), Fotografiska, the ferry ports to Djurgården, or even to the city centre.

Need somewhere to go, advice on something, or just up for a chat? Just talk to Elisabeth. She's probably the most caring, funny and down to earth host you could ever meet. Be warned though, you may find yourself spending more time in the apartment than outside! It's that nice. Your experience in Stockholm will be like nothing else.

I can't thank her enough. Even a week was not enough in the most beautiful Scandinavian city. 

And finally, did I mention you should book this place? :-)"
1248490,463823613,2019-06-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Very stylish apartment, it is spacious and very comfortable.  It is very close to some great places for food, drinks, grocery shopping, cafes and even green spaces for exercise/relaxation.  You will be spoiled for choice.  
I would definitely stay there again."
700113,131694901,2017-02-13T00:00:00.000Z,It is a comfortable place with all basic facilities. And I like the balcony with a nice park view.
954832,46338367,2015-09-09T00:00:00.000Z,Prima esperienza con airbnb. Direi proprio positiva. Mikael ci aspettava in strada  all'ora a cui avevamo detto che saremmo arrivati (11.30). Ci ha fatto trovare cartine e dato informazioni utili per il soggiorno. Ha sempre risposto prontamente ai nostri messaggi e si è sempre reso disponibile. L'appartamento  era  pulito  e come descritto. Molto gradite le cialdine per il caffè espresso. La posizione ottima. Siamo stati veramente bene. Grazie

Highly recommended!"
242188,1266971,2012-05-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia's apartment is perfectly located, central and at the same time in quite district, everything what tourist might need is close by. Apartment is clean, neat and cosy. Bed is fantastic....But the main beauty of this apartment is its hostess - Lidia. She is amazing, wonderful and welcoming lady who tells you much more than is written in any book or web about Stockholm and Sweden in general.

I 100% recommend Lidia's B&B, as missing this opportunity to get to know Lidia means that you've just passed by the Stockholm.

P.S. Her breakfasts are just separate phenomenon, that shouldn't be missed."
700113,327732112,2018-09-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Great airbnb location and stay.

The room is small and cosy, bath and toilette is clean. If I ever come to Stockholm again, I would like to sleep at Lottas home. Thank you!"
900043,104567501,2016-09-27T00:00:00.000Z,The apartment is in a great location and Annelie provided everything we needed for a long weekend in Stockholm.
700113,84164307,2016-07-05T00:00:00.000Z,I had a wonderful stay at Ilona's. The apartment was just as described and had everything I needed to enjoy Sweden. The place is very convenient and also private and after I first met Ilona I didn't see her again until the day that I left. I loved the balcony to enjoy the long Stockholm days.
1251466,65634958,2016-03-16T00:00:00.000Z,Dean was a fantastic host who made us very feel very welcome.

The apartment is in a great location in Sodermalm, right next to the train station and definitely walkable to most parts of the city. The place is clean and welcoming and best of all, returning to Lidia's always felt like going home!"
1173290,17264343,2014-08-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Christian is a great host.
His appartement is very nice and located in a very practical place.
It's close enough to the airport, easy to find by car and very close to the subway.
The neigbourhood is really quiet but you can find many bars and restaurants at a few meters in the street of the appartement. 
Christian has plenty of leaflets explaining different activities that you can do in Stockholm. It helped us more than the guide we had bought in France.
Christian and his wife were very nice and helped us a lot. They gave us all the informations and advices at the beginning of our trip and they did all they could to help us when we needed.
We were 4 friends and we stayed there for 10 days during the summer. We all really recommand this place.
Thanks a lot for that wonderfull time."

It is only a 2 minute walk from Mellqvist Kaffebar, a delicious coffee / sandwich place; the underground is close by; Drop for coffee lovers is a reasonably short walk; and so on. The flat was clean and spacious, plenty for 3 people (and the couch, surprisingly comfortable to sleep on!). Jon and Susann were very friendly and it was very easy to communicate with Jon to sort out the logistics. I definitely recommend their place and would stay there again next time I'm in Stockholm."

Le métro (à une dizaine de minutes à pieds) permet d'être dans le centre de Stockholm en une vingtaine de minutes. Ces quelques minutes de métro valent la peine puisque le cadre est particulièrement agréable si vous souhaitez un peu de calme et de nature. Le voisinage est très calme et agréable, et la vue est tout simplement sublime."

164448,197301718,2017-09-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Li's absolutely great! Her place is about a 7-min walk from two of the metros and a 15-minute walk to the Old Town. She gave me a map of Stockholm and went over all of the popular places in with me. She provided clean towels and replaced the bedding everyday, and even helped me do laundry. Li's one of the nicest people I have ever met and it was a pleasure staying with her."

 Thanks for accommodating us."
1153177,52432113,2015-10-29T00:00:00.000Z,Terry's apartment was an excellent find in a Stockholm. It's location was within easy walk to the centre or a quick trip on the tube. It was situated in a peaceful neighbourhood with a supermarket just round the corner. Terry met us when we arrived and had stocked the fridge with all the basics and more (wine and beer!) and he had made us homemade pizza! This was a perfect treat for our two kids after the journey. We loved our stay in Stockholm!

Thanks, Edwin!"

Die Wohnung ist sehr gemütlich und man findet dort alles was man braucht. Man hat dort eine herrliche Ruhe und dennoch ist die Anbindung an die U-bahn sehr gut. Auch ein Supermarkt ist gleich um die Ecke. 
Thank you for your confidence!

It’s a really cool neighborhood with a lot going on, and close to public transit to get anywhere in the city. The apartment was slick, updated, clean, roomy and had everything we needed. We saw some reviews about the bed being small, but we found it just fine! Two 6-foot+ people fit comfortably! There is a small elevator in the building, but we ended up not needing to use it. We’d stay here again in a heartbeat!"

Vannie and Andy are the most friendly, kind, caring and helpful people you can imagine and their home is both beautiful and comfortable. I had some trouble getting a phone card to work with my credit card and Vannie actually used her own credit card in order to make it work--that is WAY above and beyond and very much appreciated! I will absolutely stay with them again...they are THE BEST!! : )"

700113,310022682,2018-08-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Lägenhet var som beskrivet, det var rent, låg centralt. Dock så blev det ett missförstånd när det kom till bokningen. Jag fick inte ha gäster över, trotts att det inte står, det var ursäkter med att folk tidigare har förstört eller fått grannarna att klaga. Vilket inte står med här, vilket betyder att värden endast gick utifrån sitt omdöme och fick för sig att jag ska göra en massa oljud eller liknande. Jag fick en utskällning framför mina vänner innan vi hann gå igenom dörren om att dem inte får komma in, och värden skrek nästan i panik trotts att det inte stod att man INTE får ha några gäster över. För mig var det tyvärr inte en bra upplevelse, det kändes jobbigt och skämmigt. Jag kände mig inte välkommen, och Illona hade bekräftat min bokning av misstag enligt henne. Jag checkade in, lämnade mina saker, gick ut igen. Kom tillbaka och bytte om och när gick ut så varnade hon att inte ta med någon för att hon är vaken och har koll. Sedan gick jag ut och var med mina vänner. Vid 03.00 så hämtade jag mina saker och sov hos mina vänner då jag tyckte att jag blev fel behandlad. Allt som annars står stämmer, det är rent och fint. Väldigt centralt, hon har en väldigt fin katt. Det saknades handdukar i badrummet när jag kom fram."

The apt is calm, comfortable and clean, corresponding to the description, quiet neighborhood and easy to walk to all attractions, public transport,.... It is  perfect  for one or two persons, but to sleep at the couch is not advisable for sensitive ears (aircondition).
Nevertheless I can highly recommend to stay there , it is a good place to relax after exploring Stockholm, thank you Mathias !"

If you are a walker (like me) it is about 5-10 minutes to Gamla Stan, and 20 minutes to Kungstradgarden. Metro options also very convenient.
I would stay there again."

819676,188691545,2017-08-30T00:00:00.000Z,"A wonderful, budget-friendly, and incredibly located place to stay for individuals or couples! The room is quite small — containing a queen-sized bed, a table, a chair, a mini fridge, and a TV on a chest of drawers, with not that much floor space — but enough room and all of the essentials needed to stay for a few days comfortably (we were there for 6 nights). Really appreciated the private bathroom, as we could unpack and store our toiletries without worries of cluttering their space. The apartment is also in a great, central part of the city — within a few minutes' walk to the nearest train station, one stop from Gamla Stan, or you could just walk across the bridge to Gamla Stan within 15 minutes. And plenty of adorable cafes and shopping in their neighborhood. Andy was particularly helpful in giving suggestions for activities and even offered to help us book tickets for the boat to Drottningholm, which was very kind! Overall a lovely, comfortable place to stay, great value, and very friendly, warm, helpful hosts. Highly recommended!"

1124388,494314595,2019-07-24T00:00:00.000Z,The place is  very well connected by bus and it was nice that Carl picked us up. I can recommend it very much for tourists who don't want to take long bus transfers and like to enjoy island life in Stockholm.
1124388,160906161,2017-06-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Located at the quiet residential island of Lilla Essingen, Carl's cute apartment is ideal for a family of 2 . A small bedroom with a bed for 2, a living room which can accommodate another folding bed and a great, sunny kitchen. Carl has a fantastic collection of books and Vinyl ; he also graciously lets you use his spices and other stuff for meals. 2 minute walk to the bus stop; Bus number 1 and 56 takes you to the centre of Stockholm in 10 minutes. Lovely walks by the water.

We had a great experience staying at the flat, the area is very quiet with a few hip cafes, bars and restaurants in close walking distance. The metro line is a short 5 min walk and Marie Louise gave us some great tips on places to eat and see while we were visiting town.  She also left us snacks too. She was very easy to get in touch with and her space was clean, comfortable, tidy and well decorated. The bathroom is very tiny but other than that I would recommend this flat to anyone staying in Stockholm."

It had everything we needed and Mikael was always ready to give us advice about Stockholm. Moreover, it is located very central and close to the train.

L'appartement est bien situé, beaucoup de restaurants, de bars, de station de vélos.

Nonostante il nostro arrivo molto in ritardo, è stata così carina da aspettarci in piedi ad accoglierci.
La posizione della casa è ottima! Vicino la metro, vicino una zona piena di ristorantini. Tutto diventava raggiungibile a piedi!
Vivamente consigliato!!"

Her family is extremely cordial and polite, communication with them was very easy and they are always willing to help. The apartment is far from the city center, but it’s right next to a metro station, so it takes only around 30 minutes to be at T-Centralen. The place was very clean and I felt comfortable during my stay. I totally recommend."

283446,34169450,2015-06-05T00:00:00.000Z,"The room is cozy with a nice view of the park. The apartment has two bedrooms, a livingroom, a kitchen, and one shared bathroom. You really could not ask for a better location, easy access to the metro and grocery store coupled with the best nature you could imagine just a short walk away with cows, horses, pigs, goats, hills, and beautiful pastures. But thats not even the main reason I would advise staying at this location. Vidhatri and her family are very amazing people. They were very kind to us throughout our entire stay and extremely helpful when it came to providing directios and advice. They also make very delicious indian food which was always a plus. If you do not like eating vegetarian or do not enjoy exploring other cultures then this may not be the place for you. We however are very fond of learning and experiencimg different cultures so this was great for us. Additionally, everyone in this family seemed to wake up early in the morning, which would make sense since the sun rises at 4 am in Sweden. So it helps if you also prefer to rise early in the morning. Overall we really enjoyed staying in Sweden and being emersed in nature which this location provides."

I walked almost every day to old town or one of the other locations. The apartment is in a very picturesque part of the town. Great restaurants are nearby as well as grocery.

Malika is very welcoming. You feel immediately at home in the apartment, which is very nice and very well located (close to the metro, supermarket and a irish pub ...). The neighborhood is quiet and the island ideal for jogging.
I can only recommanded it"
708979,89849121,2016-07-30T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed in Samuel’s apartment for two weeks. He was very accommodating and did everything possible to assist us during our stay. His apartment is simple and essential but comfortable, well positioned, bright and has a good sized balcony where you can eat, sunbathe or just “sit outside”. The neighbourhood is safe and friendly and is ideal for anyone wanting to stay in a quiet, “green” place away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre but just 20 minutes from it - the metro train station is just a few minutes walk from the apartment. Close by there is a great supermarket as well as a big park. We will certainly return."
442837,77027367,2016-05-30T00:00:00.000Z,"I stayed three nights at Jo's. It was almost midnight on the first night when I arrived in Liljeholmen. Her mom, Lidia, was kind enough to meet me the station as Jo was at a work event. After we got to the flat, she sat me down and gave me many useful tips about Stockholm. The bedroom is compact but comfortable. Although this was a flat sharing, Jo was out most of the time. However, she was very responsive via messages. There are shops in the mall next to the building which makes it convenient to get food/ drinks. I'd recommend a stay at Jo's if you're looking for an affordable flat share near a metro station that's not too far from Stockholm city centre."

Er ist engagiert und wirklich bemüht, hat uns mit Infomaterial ausgestattet und war jederzeit für Fragen verfügbar.. Die Wohnung selbst ist wirklich sehr sauber, die Betten und die Handtücher, aber auch jeder Schrank war sauber und gepflegt. Alles wirklich in bester Ordnung und das macht viel vom Wohlfühlgefühl aus. Es ist alles da, was man braucht und auch die geringe Wohnfläche stört kein bisschen. Im Haus selbst ist es leise, Nachbarn haben wir weder gehört noch gesehen, es scheint ein netter Ort zu sein. Die Lage ist sehr ok, wir konnten abends gut zu Fuss aus dem Zentrum zur Wohnung laufen und würden dafür eher die Kungs(holm)gatan empfehlen als die Fleminggatan. Kungsholmen liegt auch direkt am Wasser - ebenfalls ein schöner Weg. 
Stockholm selbst ist eine wunderschöne Stadt und eine weitere Reise wert. Wenn, dann auch gerne wieder in Mikaels Studio!"
755843,179936759,2017-08-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Very central, clean appartment, perfect to stay with 2 kids. Bus 3 stops Just in front, metro is only 400 meters way. Communication with Pär went Very smoothly. We loved Stockholm!"
871262,12917116,2014-05-14T00:00:00.000Z,I enjoyed my stay in this cute little room. It was very clean and cosy and had all you need. I was in Stockholm for a conference and it could not have been better placed to get around.
1234960,344789425,2018-11-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Jacobs home is such a lovely place and we felt at home straight away. The house is furnished in a very tasteful yet relaxing fashion and has lovely extras such as the wood burning stove and the sauna. 
The area was perfect for our little family with the tube and super market just a short walk away and the lovely coffee shop Enskedeparkens bageri around the corner. 
Jacob was a great host, very flexible and attentive with speedy and friendly replies to any and all questions. 
I am happy to recommend this place to anyone."
1182616,149651667,2017-05-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Appartement prima voor paar dagen. Vraag de kamer met balkon die is het fijnst! Prima keuken. Je moet t geen probleem vinden om de badkamer te delen. En geluk hebben met rustige mede gasten, en dat hadden wij dus prima! Lokatie is perfect en leuke buurt."
1244657,120638989,2016-12-11T00:00:00.000Z,Superb location. Nic & Ursha's place is right in middle of everything (literally right next to the Hilton). Comfy bed and Nic&Ursha made me feel like home. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Stockholm
954832,30290837,2015-04-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Nous avons été très bien accueillis par Anna Karine et Mikael. Ils ont été attentionnés pour que l'on manque de rien lors de notre emménagement dans leur jolis appartement.  Discrets,  ils sont restés toujours disponibles pour nous informer ou nous communiquer des adresses pour agrémenter notre séjour. 
L'appartement était parfait pour notre séjour. Il est équipé de l' essentiel, situé dans un quartier calme, à proximité des magasins. De plus son implantation proche du métro et centre ville favorise la visite de cette belle ville de Stockholm.
Nous sommes très favorables à le recommander à nos amis."
608672,181323711,2017-08-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Based off the other reviews regarding the kitchen and bathroom, we were a bit hesitant to check it out for ourselves. However, to our surprise everything was great and really, all you need for two people. The shower was a bit cramp, but it wasn't any worse than a hostel shower or small Japanese bathroom. The location of Karl's place was probably the best aspect and well worth the price paid. It was close to grocery stores, gyms, coffee shops (for Fika!) and of course Old Town. We had a wonderful stay!"
647314,437049647,2019-04-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Mallika is a perfect host! It is my second time in her place and I truly recommend it! Her apartment is really special, in a nice location and Mallika is really discrete but at the same time willing to give tips and make all the efforts to make the stay unique!"
299154,114807673,2016-11-20T00:00:00.000Z,"A great place to stay in Södermalm. Daniel was easy to communicate with, and was flexible with the check-in time which made my travel arrangements a lot easier. Well recommended!"
916806,21475961,2014-10-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Mansour is fast on responding and give good instruction of the facility. The apartment itself is nice, clean and very well equipped and the view over the sea is wonderful. I very much enjoys the greens and the cozy neighborhood. It is nevertheless a bit hard to find and needs a bit of a walking from the station (10-15 mins)."
1261445,86048199,2016-07-14T00:00:00.000Z,Communication was very good. House was so cute and cozy across from a green area and close to the water. Quiet and very clean. Close to the T ban. Marie-Louise was very kind  and left us foods for breakfast. It was a great experience.
242188,5167811,2013-06-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia was really wonderful.  She was very helpful telling me about good things to see in Stockholm and giving me tips on how to save some money.  Her directions from the airport to her house were very good.  Her apartment is easy to get to from the airport.  You get on a commuter train and the stop is a five minute walk to her apartment.  After my check-out time was past, she really showed her true colors helping me above and beyond the call of duty.  I am most appreciative for her help at that time.  Her apartment is perfectly set up for guests with rooms on a second floor.  I highly recommend Lidia!"
1272348,97099296,2016-08-25T00:00:00.000Z,All fantastic !!!

763407,45360876,2015-09-02T00:00:00.000Z,The host canceled this reservation 23 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
819676,318668418,2018-09-04T00:00:00.000Z,"I stayed here for 4 nights and had a wonderful visit to Stockholm. This apt. is in a great area of the city, very close to public transportation. The room and bathroom was very clean and felt very private since this is at one end of the apartment. They also offer tea/coffee within the room which is a nice touch and a TV. The bed was comfy and the bathroom was very comfortable with the rain showerhead and warm towel drying rack! Everything was very modern and there is an elevator in the building.

Communication with Andy was always great and easy. I hardly saw my hosts during the time I was there but they seem like lovely and warm people. If I were to visit Stockholm again I would definitely stay here. The neighborhood is really great and different than staying down in the city center. More cozy, quaint with tons of outdoor places to eat. Highly recommend!"
1124388,49382622,2015-10-03T00:00:00.000Z,"The house is exactly as pictured. Very cozy, perfect for two. Clean and quiet neighborhood. Easily accessible through public transportation. Carl is a great host. He waited for us at the apartment and left useful information, including leaflets of activities to do and some suggestions. He left coffee, tea and milk for breakfast and we had access to the pantry and spice cabinet if we needed. The house is full of books and many interesting items. We were also able to use the record player and listen to his collection of vinyl cds."
568341,437912394,2019-04-15T00:00:00.000Z,We had an amazing time with Sam. He told us great stories about DC and took us to some really cool places. Would definitely reccommend his tour!
904739,354724983,2018-12-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Just a weird host not too much communicative and giving suggestive messages about 5star review for him...
Nothing bad happened but had a felling sth is not right"
755843,130897308,2017-02-09T00:00:00.000Z,Very good
145320,452849736,2019-05-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Kim's place is great! The location is very central but close to all the interesting sites. It is not the main touristy area which is by all means a huge plus. All of the restaurants, coffee shops, and bakeries right down the street were amazing. The amenities were very good. Overall we really enjoyed it."
688947,2688070,2012-10-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Really nice. Not in the city but near the tunnelbana to access the city really easy within 15 minutes, stops in södermalm, gamla stan and city. 
Nice Host, we could also use the kitchen and had a simple room as expected:)
Everything fine!"
1124388,26068415,2015-02-02T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a great time in Carls apartment. It's very clean, conveniently located and has all the amineties ons would need. Furthermore, Carl provided excellent instructions on how to reach the apartment. It's right on the route of bus line 1, which runs every few minutes and also passes the city center. I would recommend Carls apartment to anyone."
283446,2673881,2012-10-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Me and my friend stayed with this family for 3 days and the experience was great! as italians we gave up to our croissants for indian pancakes ;) our private room was fine and nice. there was just one toilet in the house, but definitely easy to survive :)
this couple has got a talented daughter."
1204621,261793431,2018-05-07T00:00:00.000Z,Nettan’s room is clean and sophisticated!
543045,43030991,2015-08-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Really enjoyed staying at Anton's flat, it was the perfect base for a first trip to Stockholm.  The local area is very cool with lots of different things to do whether you're looking for shopping, nights out or outdoor activities like kayaking.  Anton was really nice and friendly, providing good suggestions and information to get us started.  The flat itself is amazing, beautifully decorated and very comfortable."
1244657,200373401,2017-10-05T00:00:00.000Z,Great location.Next to the metro and bus stand. Nice hosts.Helpful.  Would stay again if ever come to Stockholm.
302496,41779218,2015-08-09T00:00:00.000Z,Staying in Seta's home was one of the highlights of my trip to Stockholm.   Operating as my home for time in Stockholm I felt like a resident more than a tourist.  I was able to maintain a fairly rigorous schedule of sightseeing and day trips; access to transportation was right outside the door.   A few nights we stayed in a prepare meals in the wonderful kitchen and ate in the dining room with candles.  A few close friends staying near by visited for a wine and cheese and they all marveled at the palatial setting.  Honestly this was one of my top hosted experiences.   i wouldn't change a thing.
700113,28603256,2015-03-27T00:00:00.000Z,Llona sent clear information before my trip and was very welcoming when I arrived. The apartment was very clean and tidy. The buses and t-bana are only a short walk away. I can recommend staying here.
1153177,184194071,2017-08-19T00:00:00.000Z,"My family and I spent 14 days touring Scandinavia, staying at 3 different airbnbs.  By far, this was the best place we stayed!  The apartment is spacious and full of light.  It fit three adults and two teenagers quite comfortably.  The two bathrooms came in handy.  Terry  has set up  the apartment so that you feel like it's your own; plenty of space to put your own things in the closets and bathrooms, free access to all the pantry items in the kitchen (fully  stocked kitchen), lots of extra towels, easy trash disposal right outside the door of the apartment, and he even left us prepared food when we arrived!  Very thoughtful.  Terry was a delight- he greeted us at the apartment and walked us through everything and then slipped out.  Couldn't have asked for more.  The location is ideal - very safe area with lots of shops and food nearby  (there is a bakery and an Italian restaurant about 4 minutes away!) and within walking distance of downtown.  Stockholm was by far our favorite city to explore.  The metro stop is just a 2 minute walk from Terry's apartment, so it was very convenient to get around - and to stop back at the apartment mid-day for a rest!  The apartment has two balconies to sit on and enjoy the neighborhood. We were able to save money by grabbing food at the nearby grocery store and preparing our dinners in.  Highly recommend a visit to the Ostermalms Saluhall, a food hall with lots of local food - bakeries, fish markets, and some prepared food ready to take home and eat.  Lovely place and within walking distance.  Can't say enough to recommend Terry's place for a stay in Stockholm!  We really enjoyed it."
819676,107758954,2016-10-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Great spot in an upbeat neighbourhood. Within walking distance to the old town and all basic necessities. Hosts were warm and welcoming, would definitely stay with them again!"
220851,1250079,2012-05-08T00:00:00.000Z,Very friendly. Very clean. Great location. Coming back.
897584,230402536,2018-01-28T00:00:00.000Z,Vivekas Wohnung ist schön und super gelegen. Relativ zentral und trotzdem schön ruhig. Sie hat immer schnell auf Fragen reargiert. Wir empfehlen diese Wohnung gerne weiter :)
700113,97677525,2016-08-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Ilona's flat was a great place to stay. She was friendly and great with communications, and there were some welcoming nibbles laid out for me when I arrived. The flat is in a very central location, a short walk (maybe seven minutes or so) from the nearest metro station, and there are two supermarkets very nearby as well as loads of cafes, and a big park immediately across the street. The flat is small, but the space is organised very efficiently, so it didn't feel cramped. There is ample storage space in the wardrobe closet and the bathroom, plus a vacant drawer in the dresser and two drawers next to the bed. The bed and sofa are comfortable, and the balcony overlooking the park is absolutely lovely and gets full sunlight in the afternoon. The neighbourhood is rather noisy, so if you're a light sleeper you may want to bring ear plugs. There is a small kitchenette, but no pots, pans, or coffee maker (though there is a microwave and hot water kettle), so you'll only be able to cook in the microwave. Ilona lives in the conjoined flat (they're separate - they just share the entry foyer), so this is an ideal place for a quiet individual or couple. Ilona was a great host, and I'd definitely recommend her flat!"
776012,314149244,2018-08-26T00:00:00.000Z,Super gelegenes und sehr sauberes Appartement im Zentrum mit Blick über die Altstadt. Sehr freundliche Gastgeber.
536283,13652035,2014-06-02T00:00:00.000Z,I just spent two nights in Paolo's apartment while I was in Stockholm to run the marathon this weekend. The place was perfect for my needs and really conveniently located. For a vibrant neighbourhood in the inner city it was very quiet and comfortable. Paolo was very helpful regarding suggestions for places to eat in the area and was always very quick to respond to any query that I had. This was my first experience of using Airbnb and I'm converted. If all of my future stays are as good as this I will be a satisfied customer.
299154,6115411,2013-07-30T00:00:00.000Z,Best possible location in Stockholm. Nice apartment. Thanks for having us!
313763,60359712,2016-01-22T00:00:00.000Z,"I visited Stockholm for work and Martin's apartment was perfect. Warm, comfy and clean. If I lived in Stockholm, I would get a similar apartment.  Great location in a very cool part of the city. Martin met me at the apartment and provided a ton of extremely helpful feedback. This was above and beyond what I expected but very helpful for someone visiting the city for the first time. I would highly recommend staying here. His list of restaurants, tips on the city and overall friendly demeanor made the stay very comfortable. Had some of the best Lebanese food I have ever had.  Just wish I had more time in the city. Thanks Martin!"
1121469,126907669,2017-01-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Saras apartment was wonderful! Very cozy, relaxing and good vibes! It is close to the tube and stores and situated in a calm neighborhood. The communication with sara worked great! There was no problems whatsoever and I would love to stay at her place again! Very recomended!"
164448,126259540,2017-01-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia's Airbnb was a great value and fairly centrally located. The room was clean, we had access to the kitchen and a living space as well as the bathroom, shower, ironing board, tea, and coffee. Lidia was kind and gave us a map as well as advice for where to travel, how to get around, and a bit of history about the city. Definitely a worthwhile stay."
536691,2878481,2012-11-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Such a great flat with a lot of interesting decorations to look at.
Super convenient location, close to metro station as well as grocery stores.  Cecilia was really great at responding whenever we had questions.  I would recommend anyone who would want to stay quality time in Stockholm"
608672,167596268,2017-07-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Karl was amazing, made sure we were well informed of what the city had to offer and made sure we knew the way around town. 10/10"
620848,5880929,2013-07-21T00:00:00.000Z,"When we arrived at Hanna's and Keith's place, Keith welcomed us and showed us the freshly cleaned apparment as well as the neighborhood. The appartment was great, we had dinner in the Patio and it had a Baby bed and a Baby seat for our 16 months old daughter. Since the Train Station is very Close, we could easily go and visit the centre of beautiful Stockholm. Hanna and Keith were very helpful and generous. Thanks for everything!!! Caroline with Kilian and Dana"
757320,129631710,2017-02-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Barb's place is located in the lively and eclectic part of Stockholm — Sodermalm. You can find lots of nice restaurants at a reasonable price in the area.

One of the free walking tour —Soder Tour—is also within the same area. Starting point of the tour is just 10min walk away from Barb's place. A massive supermarket is only 5min walk away from her place. 

Barb is a very warm and friendly person. Everything was perfect at her apartment except you can't do laundry there because the laundry service is only available for private use, not for guests in the building."
533880,2138469,2012-08-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Jarl es un excelente anfitrión y siempre está dispuesto a ayudarte o resolver cualquier duda que te pueda surgir. En mi caso estuve en Estocolmo por unas entrevistas de trabajo y me fue de gran ayuda de cara a resolver las dudas que tenía sobre el coste de la vida allí.

Además el apartamento está muy bien situado.  En una zona muy tranquila en todos los aspectos sin apenas ruido pero a la vez muy bien comunicada por metro y autobús. O si lo prefieres en unos 20 minutos andando te plantas en la zona centro.

Jarl is a great host who is always willing to help or answer any questions you may have. In my case I was in Stockholm for some job interviews so he help me a lot by answering my questions related with life-cost.

The apartment is very well located. A very quiet area but well connected by metro and bus. You can also reach the center by walking in 20 minutes."
1182616,259651438,2018-05-01T00:00:00.000Z,Excellent communication with the host and location.
916806,30919990,2015-04-29T00:00:00.000Z,"My Husband and I stayed at the apartment for 5 nights, part of our 16 day Scandinavian trip.

Upon first arrival, the apartment is located with beautiful scenic views and refurbished to high standards. It was clean and well organised. Mansour was quick at responding to any enquiries that we had.

Unfortunately, the apartment was not equipped for our basic needs and requires some thorough updating. Some examples are: No toaster, no oven (Microwave oven only), overrused and damaged pots/pans and cutlery, lack of toilet roll supply, etc.

We felt that the place hadn't been updated for almost 2 years. For a self-catering option, we were very limited."
1124388,121283143,2016-12-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Carl's place was everything we needed. The kitchen was well equipped, the shower had good hot water and the bed was reasonably comfortable. The neighbourhood was lovely and quiet and the scenery was beautiful. We had an enjoyable stay."
755843,69006723,2016-04-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Great stay, brilliant location"
1182616,138257656,2017-03-19T00:00:00.000Z,"I am disappointed with the apartment. Peter is not living in the house, and the flat works like a hostel. You have to share the bathroom with 8 people, and even more if new guests arrives (our case). The bathroom smells and it's not clean due to the number of guests using it. There is not living room as it is used as another room for 4 people."
1054406,502837893,2019-08-05T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a good stay in the appartment. Host was very easy going and responded quickly to questions. Location was perfect, close to a nice lake and to the center of Stockholm."
259025,31413151,2015-05-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Didn't have much interaction with Ali, but he did welcome us on short notice and for that we are grateful. He even offered to drive us to get food since we arrived late. As for location, it is 30 minutes from the central station, further than I expected, but the metro station is a short walk away. Something to note is that it is located in the suburbs, so don't expect a lively neighborhood atmosphere. One thing that did confuse me though was the hefty cleaning fee I was charged, despite the fact that we were required to clean on the day of our departure. All in all, Ali's place served its purpose fine, but I would seek accommodation elsewhere next time I'm in Stockholm."
560308,253896002,2018-04-15T00:00:00.000Z,The apartment was super clean and everything was prepared for our stay! The communication was good. Thanks for having us and being so flexible with the check in and check out times :)

Close to the metro station that was perfect !"
1304431,480199161,2019-07-02T00:00:00.000Z,Our stay at Madeleine’s home was pleasant. We were expecting a little more but we got settled into the cozy apartment quickly. The beds in the kids room were very high bunk beds which were fine for our children but will be a problem for younger or less agile people. You have to really climb up into all 3 of them. We were disappointed by the complete lack of closet space available for our personal items for our week long stay. It was however a nice central location to visit Stockholm for the first time which was great!
242188,29130393,2015-04-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Had a really nice time - Lidia was very warm and welcoming. She spent extra time helping me out with questions, which was greatly appreciated. Thanks, Lidia!"

Although I sent my inquiry very late (a day before), Martin was quick with answering. He was very polite and accommodating, giving me all kind of details on what I did not need to bring (hair dryer, etc.). He even met up with me at the subway station to take me to the flat.

The flat is perfectly located, nearby green areas for jogging and 5-10 minutes walking distance from downtown. It is a small, but perfectly equipped flat. 

Martin had left a fruit and chocolate basket as well as a bathrobe. Very considerate!!

If available, I will rent his flat next time as well!!"

Nous avons aussi apprécié le quartier, certes résidentiel mais au bord de l'eau avec une belle promenade, des airs de jeux pour enfants et malgré tout très proche du centre en bus ( 10 à 15 min de city terminalen) avec un petit commerce au pied de la résidence ainsi que quelques restaurants ( pizzeria, tapas).
Enfin, accueil et disponibilité parfaite de l'hôte.
A noter, la chambre n'est pas close et le lit est plutôt petit, tout dépend du gabarit des dormeurs!"
313763,242509454,2018-03-12T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment is beautiful and situated in a strategic area if you would like to visit the city. There are supermarkets and a lot of restaurants/pubs around.
I had a delayed flight and Martin was very easy to coordinate with and ready to answer to the messages. Once arrived he showed the house, the kitchen and gave a list of recommended restaurants in Stockholm.
I stayed there three days, but had to leave one day earlier for unexpected work reasons. Martin did not accept to modify my booking (as Airbnb offered), he said that nobody could book that room two days before because it was too late. It was only around 30eur but could understand his position.
There was also another person in the apartment who was sleeping on the couch, I didn’t know, so the bathroom was shared by three people."

283446,154794137,2017-05-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Check in was great, Vidhatri was extra informative with instructions, pricing and logistics which was valuable. I was also given great instructions on places to eat. I was there for business and the football the stadium was only a few stops away on the train and the location of the train station was perfect. The apartment is also located next to a great park with animals and good for a walk or run. If you want to get to central Stockholm it is a distance that was the only negative but no fault of the hosts. The area was a little \"ghetto\" lots of young men hanging around and could be a little imposing if you are a female, again no fault of the hosts. 

Some good shops locally for food and bits and pieces. There is a pizza restaurant near by which is a football hub and good beer (no wifi) 

Hospitality was superb and it was great to taste some home made Indian breakfast. The bed could be more comfortable and more pillows provided but the room was great/tidy. The wifi was great too."

It was very easy to communicate with Jon who was very friendly, letting us know about good shops/ restaurants around the flat.

As we were traveling with our daughter of 14 months old, we really appreciate to be able to use baby chair, nursing table which were in the flat. She could also plays with the little toys of Jon's daughter and that was really nice !

We really enjoyed to be in Sodermalm.

We recommend this apartment !!"

916806,69733535,2016-04-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Mansour gave us a really detailed explanation to find the apartment outside of the centre of Stockholm. So it was really easy to find and to check in. We were totally impressed by the view when we arrive. The sunset at the lake was amazing. 
The apartment is modern (as shown in the pics) and clean. We found everything we need to cook in the kitchen. 
The neighborhood was sweet and silent. So its perfect if you want to escape the rush in the city centre, relax a bit and to see a lot of Swedens typical red wooden houses."

Nice open air walkways which are welcome before heading into long flights. Shops and restaurants conveniently a few steps away. Close to metro which has lifts if you have luggage. Neat, clean and tidy. Nice extra touch was the offer of use of a secure wifi connection. 
The area is a busy residential one so there may be some people noise - it didn't bother me but I am pretty travel robust."

Sited in a very quite area, no traffic or neighbors noises. Sergej was very friendly and helpful, but also very discreet. I recommend this apt to people wishing to visit Stockholm or people like me who went to Stockholm for work and did not find place in the hotel. Only one remark, the bed is not huge so if you are not quite thin it could be a bit uncomfortable for two people (no problem for one p), on the other hand the sofa is very huge so I think you can sort it out. definetely, I recommend this apt!"

The area is absolutely ideal for local coffee and eats. 
For once, it was lovely not to have wifi. No phone beeping, and we could actually get back to reading, stretching and relaxing."

The location is fantastic, in a quiet residential neighborhood but walkable to public transit and many other neighborhood gems. The bed is very comfortable, and the accommodations are perfect for a solo traveler exploring the city. When I arrived, Lidia had a full Swedish breakfast waiting, which was a lovely surprise. She also has a common room upstairs for her AirBnB guests fully equipped with a small fridge and coffee maker. Lidia has copious recommendations for things to do in Stockholm, and was lovely to chat with after a full day of exploring. She is so knowledgable and helpful- it was really like staying with a welcoming family friend and less like a stranger. I'll definitely stay with her again when I make it back to Stockholm!"

She lives in the apartment next door and you share a common entrance way to lead into the two separate apartments, which I didn't realize. But she never bothered me or intruded in my own space. You have a key to your own apartment to lock it as well. The apartment had a bit of an interesting smell, but was super lovely! She had everything you could possibly need in the kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, etc. Super sweet and in a great area near a ton of restaurants and a great park. A bit of walking from downtown, but public transportation is easy. I loved this area!"

They said it was spotlessly clean, fully furnished and equipped with everything they needed, and in a perfect, VERY quiet, convenient location, very easily accessible to transportation and shopping for all necessities.  It took them about 20 minutes to get into the center of Stockholm.  The kitchen was well stocked with equipment, and there were two huge supermarkets right near the station.  The apartment faces a grass courtyard, so the view was peaceful and lovely.  My mother, who is quite particular and fussy, said, \"It could not not have been better, and we could not have been happier with the accommodations.  Diana was so organized, was always exactly on time to meet us, was so lovely and helpful, and could not have been nicer.  We wanted to stay an extra night, and Diana was so accommodating and made it possible.  We just loved everything about our stay in her apartment!  When we return to Sweden, we hope her apartment is available so that we can stay there again.\""

The apartment was nice and tidy, the location is superb and we had everything we need. Way to go Daniel, if I come back in Stockholm, I'll definitely consider coming back here."
1054406,102341803,2016-09-17T00:00:00.000Z,"We got a warm welcome from Madeleine who showed us around and helped us after a very early flight with coffee and milk. The appartment is well equipped and exactly as Thomas desciption on the airbnb plattform. We had great sunny days in wonderful Stockholm and even the appartment is not placed very central but you can get around easily with the official transport and the lake nearby invites for a morning swim (what we did!). And thank you so much, Thomas, on saturday for the great early chaffeur service to the Airport Shuttle! We definately can recommend a stay in that beatiful area! Hope to come back one day and then we'll show it to out two sons!"

Daniel is very flexible and welcoming. I would definitely come back. Thanks!"

581243,9882455,2014-01-16T00:00:00.000Z,"After 17 Airbnb experiences, we are happy to say that Edwin was an exceptional host in every way.  Edwin is a great communicator and gave us detailed directions and useful information for our stay.  The apartment is beautifully clean and extremely well located - just metres from a large shopping complex and train station, but über-quiet with triple-glaze windows!  The bed was fantastic.  Edwin has an eye for quality and detail so the apartment is fully equipped for guests.  Highly recommended."
974175,7512869,2013-09-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Sofie's place is so good! The pictures are true! And the also atmosphere and feel are good.

The preparation of our stay was perfect. Because of our 11-month-old daughter we also needed a babybed and and babychair for her and Sofie also provided these.

We liked her place very much and recommend to everyone."
608672,175062267,2017-07-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Karl is a friendly and welcoming host and he kindly let me check in early as I arrived on the overnight ferry from Helsinki. The check-in process was very straight-forward. The location is perfect for exploring Stockholm on foot or by Metro and there are lots of local restaurants, supermarkets, and even an English-style pub that’s well worth a visit. The room is quiet, cosy, comfortable, and ok for one person. It might be a bit too cosy for two. The walk-in-wardrobe doubles as the kitchenette which is tiny and has no sink or water. I had avoided having a shower on the ferry because the showers are so tiny, but that was a big mistake. The shower here must be the worst that I have ever come across in my travels; including several I have made comments on in reviews on here – you have to put down a small aluminium quadrant (which fails to prevent the bathroom flooding), pull round a plastic shower curtain (ditto), stand in this tiny enclave, and try to wash yourself, grabbing the soap and shampoo off the toilet lid. Afterwards, you need to scrape the bathroom floor to clean up the flood and tread on a damp floor for the next few hours. Just be aware that if you book this place, you will have a comfortable stay except in the bathroom and kitchenette."
862528,493846689,2019-07-23T00:00:00.000Z,Thanks Arne for his passionate welcome. A nice and large house for a family.

1139359,250219032,2018-04-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Maria and her husband have an absolutely beautiful flat. It is in an excellent location, with quite a few grocery stores, restaurants and a subway station within just a couple of blocks. It's also an easy walk to Fotografiska (the photography museum) and Torget at Medborgarplatsen (a square with cinema, shops and restaurants).  It is exactly as pictured, if not better. It's spacious and was incredibly clean. There were five of us: My husband and I, our two children and my mother-in-law and we fit perfectly. Maria was wonderfully communicative throughout the whole process and met us at the flat when we checked in to give us a thorough walk through. She and her husband were very friendly and sweet and even left us a bottle of wine and some chocolates. There can sometimes be a little noise at night from the street below (patrons coming and going from bars) but it was never too bad. We would happily stay in their lovely flat on our next stay in Stockholm. We highly recommend their place."

1182616,116144907,2016-11-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Peter's place was very comfortable and extremely convenient because it was close to a major subway station. Communication was easy, and he gave very clear instructions on how to get to/from the airport. One thing to keep in mind is that the apartment is shared, so if you want a private, quiet night, this may not be the best place for you."
819676,103742847,2016-09-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Andreas's home was perfect for my stay in Stockholm. Can't recommend highly enough. Walkable everywhere, he was incredibly accommodating after my redeye. If I come back to Stockholm soon, I would definitely stay here again."

I really recommend renting this apartment, it's central and close to everything you might need or want to see. The neighborhood is 
really cozy! 
Daniel was very kind and welcoming when we arrived and gave us some tips on how to get where we were headed the next day. 
Would definitely rent this again!"

The communication was immediate and easy check in and out. The apartment is beautiful, very quiet, fully equipped (our children enjoyed the large TV screen) and perfectly located to discover Stockholm. We had a rented car and no problems finding a space to park. Across the street is super market, the area full with nice bars and restaurants."

871262,5755579,2013-07-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Lotta's home is fantastically located in a residential area if you want a quiet base close to all the visit-worthy sites in Stockholm (museums, parks/gardens, shopping, really good restaurants) . It takes not more than 5mins walk to Saluhall for breakfast/lunch, 10mins leisurely walk to Djurgardens and 6-7mins leisurely walk to boats/ferries to explore the other islands. Other forms of public transportation are all within 4-5mins of a pleasant walk amongst mostly residential buildings. 
Lotta herself is a lovely lady who was barely around, but a pleasure to talk to when our schedules crossed. Helpful, welcoming and easy-going were my impressions.
The flat itself was warm, clean and cozy- exactly what one is looking for a city exploration trip. I would truly recommend it to anyone. I really had a fantastic time in Stockholm- mostly because of Lotta's flat."

Sofie has a great taste and her beautiful, convenient ground floor appartment is full of nice things and good furniture. If you like cooking you will love her kitchen which has all the appliences you can think of.
The bright and roomy appartment lies on a quiet street in a lively neighbourhood with lots of nice stores and good restaurants closeby. If you want to go to the old town, the underground is just around the corner and the centre of Stockholm is just a few stops away. Sofie and Jesper are great hosts who will respond quickly if you have questions or remarks, They really want you to feel at home. And that is exactly what we did!"
700113,18718192,2014-08-31T00:00:00.000Z,"I stayed 5 nights at Ilona's appartment in Stockholm and it was very nice. Ilona provided me with al the information how to come to here place and gave me a very warm welcome. The appartment is perfect for a single person, or a couple (the bed is small but nice and soft) and contains everything you need. The appartment was very clean and cosy. The appartment is close to many bus and metro stops and a small but lovely park is very near. As you can expect in any large city, there is some noise during the night if you sleep with the windows open. It did not bother me but otherwise just bring a pair of earplugs and you will be fine.
Thank you Illona for the nice stay!"

I cannot recommend them highly enough.  If you stay with them, you are in for a very special treat!"

Barb ist eine sehr sympathische, freundliche und hilfsbereite Gastgeberin. Sie gibt Tipps zur Stadt und nimmt sich Zeit für Gespräche. 
Das Zimmer in Barbs Wohnung ist sehr gepflegt und sauber. Die Mitbenutzung des Badezimmers und der Küche war kein Problem. Das Zimmer ist sehr ruhig - von der Straße war kaum Lärm zu hören. 
Die Wohnung liegt im 6. Stock und ist mit einem Aufzug gut erreichbar.

1149820,12836524,2014-05-12T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a wonderful time at Klara's apartment. Though we flew in very late, Klara was very generous with our \"late-check-in\". This is very much appreciated. The apartment itself is beautiful and the interior is designed the typical Swedish style: simple and elegant. Kitchen is perfectly equipped and when you lie in the bed, you can see the sun set through the window. Obviously the location of the apartment is superb: close to the station of the airport bus shuttle and still in the middle of Sodermalm. Klara will share some local recommendations (cinnamon buns!) which you should definitely try - in fact the best cinnamon buns  we could find. All in all we couldn't recommend enough staying at Klara's place. Thanks for all the help and the great time!"
533880,10177844,2014-02-04T00:00:00.000Z,"I enjoyed my stay at this room very much :-)
The room is great, tidily and large enough for one person to live there comfortably. The flat is very clean and nice. 
Jarl is a very nice, helpful and caring person, giving you your privacy. The position of this room is perfect. It is a peaceful area, but it took you only 2 subway stations to be at the central station and within the city. KTH is also not far away (for all exchange students ;)).
There is only one tiny thing to say: the walls are quiet thin so the flat is quiet clairaudient. So if you want to sleep long in the morning check whether Jarls (very lovely!) kids are there. Because they are kids, it could get a little bit louder ;-) But he will tell you whether they are there or not before confirming your booking. 
Personally, I can really recommend the room and the host :-) It was very nice and I will come back if I'm looking for an accommodation in Stockholm again."

1137050,15772371,2014-07-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Gabriel’s apartment is simply fantastic. Not only is it very well organized he has impeccable taste. I loved the Bohemian studio look and it was a great fit for me (as I am also interested in art and painting). In fact the place is so nice that I felt almost more like a museum curator rather than a guest!
The area itself is lively, with an array of nice bars and restaurants, as well as a small park - very useful for relaxing after a hard day’s work (I was over on business).
Gabriel himself was very helpful. Not only did he comprehensively answer all my questions but also he was very accommodating as to my arrival date, and left milk and juice in the fridge.
Definitely will be looking to stay there again next time I’m in Stockholm (…although that’s going to be harder with many more reviews like this!!!)"

845365,48248824,2015-09-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Michael was a fantastic host, more like visiting a friend than staying with a stranger. Plenty of power outlets, too, which was a nice change from many of the places I stay when traveling.

From pancakes the night I arrived to a quick tour of the local area to get myself oriented, Michael was incredibly accommodating and helpful. We also had a series of fantastic conversations on myriad topics over the course of my stay.

The room was cosy — great for one person, two if a couple, but might be a bit tight for three... I slept comfortably so no complaints :)

Be sure to check out the boat ride from a nearby stop, and the cafe with views over the water a 5-10 minute walk away."

De locatie is centraal en heel gemakkelijk met de metro te bereiken. Slechts 2 of 3 haltes van Gamla Stan af.
