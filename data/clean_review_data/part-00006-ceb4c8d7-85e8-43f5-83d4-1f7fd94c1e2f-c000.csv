This is a shared apartment with the host. I stayed in a private room, with my own toilet/sink. Bath/shower is shared with host.
It's on the 5th floor in a quiet residential street. It's a lovely part of Stockholm, with a few cafes around. 

Bathroom and bedroom are clean and good condition."
1205051,5150115,2013-06-15T00:00:00.000Z,Thank you for the beautiful days in Stockholm and the stay at your apartment. The apartment is super centrally located. The stay was much appreciated. The apartment is clean and pure.

Sommer pur, somit konnten wir auch den Balkon voll ausnutzen, was eine echte Bereicherung für die Wohnung ist! Die Lage ist klasse, Strand, Restaurants, Supermarkt und öffentliche Verkehrsmittel (inkl. Flughafenbus nach Arlanda) sind nur 5 Min. entfernt, perfekt! Wir konnten Marie leider nicht persönlich kennenlernen, aber die Kommunikation mit ihr im Vorfeld war super und sie hat alles für uns hergerichtet und eine nette \"Anleitung\" verfasst, so dass wir keine weitere Hilfe benötigt haben (wäre aber durch ihre Schwester in der Nähe möglich gewesen!). Wir würden auf jeden Fall wiederkommen und vermissen Grisen bereits sehr!!"

916806,313861407,2018-08-26T00:00:00.000Z,"The place is very nice! Has all the facilities that you need during your stay! The view is amazing! The metro station is about 15 min walking, and takes about 30 min to go to the center with the metro. So you must have the metro ticket! Me and my family enjoyed a lot!"
1182616,215874360,2017-12-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Everything was pretty great! Easy and fast communication, flexible check-in and check-out, overall a very nice place to stay in Stockholm!"
608672,15570178,2014-07-12T00:00:00.000Z,Karl was so helpful and made our stay as easy as possible. Easily contactable and no issues with arrival and departure
368952,1248188,2012-05-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Very nice, helpful and hospitable host with an adorable dog! Not very practical location to get to the centre/airport, so it might not be the best idea if you come for a day. The area is very green and you can go for refreshing, and scenic walks in the forest. The house is very nice and cosy. Also keep in mind that there is no bathroom in the garden shed, so you have to go in and out of the house."
581243,137723786,2017-03-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin's place is in a great location and was really clean. Communication was really good, he gave us detailed instruction on how to get to his place which made it really easy to get there. He greeted us on check-in and made us feel welcome. Would definitely recommend!"
776155,30141128,2015-04-18T00:00:00.000Z,I had another great stay at Ann-Sofie's in April.  See my previous review for more details.
514210,158331438,2017-06-06T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a great time at Margareta's place. The room was nice and clean and a great place to relax. Margareta was very kind to us! She helped us whenever we had questions and even lent us an umbrella when it was a rainy day. The house has a nice and quiet neighborhood, there is a grocery very close to it, where you can get anything you need and there is also a bus stop from where you can get to the city center very fast."
819676,136373813,2017-03-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Andy was super friendly and helpful. Check-in was easy and everything was explained as best as possible. The house was clean, modern, and very central to everything. 10/10 would stay again."
954832,401609708,2019-01-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Un hôte exceptionnel, un appartement parfait ! C’est la première fois que je rencontre un hôte aussi prévenant et gentil. L’appartement est idéalement situé Et très confortable, il est très bien chauffé ! Je recommande les yeux fermés !!!! Merci infiniment Mikael  !"
624886,199168265,2017-10-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Vi boede i Oskar's lejlighed i en uge og var meget tilfredse med opholdet. Oskar har fra første kontakt været både rar og betænksom, han svarer indenfor meget kort tid på alle henvendelser og han og familien havde gjort lejligheden SÅ fin til vi skulle overtage den. Der var gjort plads til vores ting overalt i lejligheden og familien havde endda sørget for ekstra ting til vores mindste datter, fx en pusleplads på badeværelset og opredt babyseng i soveværelset. Som billederne viser er lejligheden meget smukt indrettet og placeringen er genial i kort afstand til legeplads, restauranter, svensk ø-natur, shopping, metro, mm. Alt i alt de bedste anbefalinger herfra!"
1182616,22358877,2014-11-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Peter arrived at the apartment at about the same time as we did and gave us a warm welcome.  The room wasn't quite ready for us when we arrived, but Peter made sure everything was cleaned and reset for us, as well as provided fresh towels and allowed us to use his laundry detergent.

While the floors could use a bit of a sweep since there's so many people in and out, the listing was very accurate and the neighborhood was wonderful!  Some of the other Airbnber's could be a little noisy late at night and the walls are a bit thin.  We didn't run into any major issues with the single bathroom either.

We only saw him once during our stay, but he had some great recommendations for us, along with a referral to the best vegetarian restaurant I've ever been to!  I would definitely stay at this apartment again."
1149820,19029038,2014-09-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Cute little studio in a quiet neighborhood. Awesome location: you can get anywhere in Stockholm within minutes thanks to the metro station nearby. Getting there from the airport is also very straightforward (there's a direct bus) and Klara was really helpful and easy going. The studio was perfect for my week-long stay, though the kitchen and bathroom were rather small."
1166419,98306906,2016-08-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Great host! Comfy apartment, close to all amenities and perfect location for those who wish to explore the vibrant city of Stockholm! Would definitely recommend it :)"
1048260,72327748,2016-05-02T00:00:00.000Z,Very nice apartment- clean and with own style. Annika was very supportive during all the time. Thank you!
274876,19025328,2014-09-05T00:00:00.000Z,Emma's apartment worked perfectly for our 8 day stay in Stockholm.  The apartment was centrally located and close to several bus lines into the city and within walking distance of many restaurants and 2 grocery stores.  Emma left everything we could need for the week and was readily available to respond to questions.  My 4 yr old as well as my 8 yr old niece traveled with us and there was a really nice park about 3 blocks away that they loved.
739726,4704083,2013-05-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Sanna's apartment is a lovely home away from home. It's tastefully decorated, spacious enough for two persons, fully equipped and offers everything you need. The bed is very comfortable. The place is in a quiet side street in a great location not too far from the T-bana station in the heart of SoFo, with great shops and restaurants around the corner. Moreover, Sanna was very very nice and helpful. We truly enjoyed our stay in Sanna's place. And if we ever make it back to Stockholm, hopefully Sanna's place will be available again!"
1153177,95765164,2016-08-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Terry was a great host.  He had a light meal prepared when we arrived.  He was helpful in pointing out local coffee houses, markets etc."
1137050,4849529,2013-05-28T00:00:00.000Z,"It was a pleasure to spend our weekend in Stockholm at Gabriel's beautiful and comfortable apartment. The apartment is right at the centre of Sofo, Stockholm's arty/trendy area, with plenty of great restaurants, cafes and bars just around the corner, but still very quiet and peaceful. Gabriel was very welcoming and helpful. He recommended places to see and things to do and gave us detailed directions. I would highly recommend his apartment to others and would definitely stay there again myself next time in Stockholm."
795354,480670400,2019-07-03T00:00:00.000Z,"O Gustav foi atencioso comigo desde o momento em que fiz a reserva até a minha saída, já dando uma positiva amostra de como os locais recebem e tratam os turistas. A apartamento é excelente e as fotos correspondem exatamente ao que se vai encontrar quando se está lá. Está bem equipado e com tudo à disposição do hóspede. Apesar de o apartamento não estar localizado no centro antigo (Gamla Stan), é possível ir até lá rapidamente de metrô (há uma estação muito próxima) ou a pé (15 minutos), dependendo da disposição e do preparo físico, aliás também necessário para enfrentar os quatro andares de escadas até chegar ao apartamento (não há elevador). Nas imediações, há bares, restaurantes, cafés e até uma lavanderia (em frente ao metrô Odenplan, que conecta o bairro ao aeroporto de Arlanda). Recomendo muito a hospedagem e voltaria lá com certeza. Deixo aqui um agradecimento ao Gustav."
242188,90653032,2016-08-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia's place was great. Well located. 

She did an awesome job of making me feel at home"
1212891,280023989,2018-06-22T00:00:00.000Z,"The flat is very clean and beautifully decorated. Maud is so friendly. She prepared everything in detail. Supermarket and metro station are within 5 minutes walk. Sammy, the lovely cat, is very quiet and good tamed. Nice living with Maud and Sammy."
581243,95293694,2016-08-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Great location and very clean room, and smooth check-in process. Recommending this place!"
763407,4831751,2013-05-28T00:00:00.000Z,"My friends and me had a really good time at Gabriella's place and in Stockholm. The apartment was new and very spacious, also for 4 persons and it was perfectly cleaned and prepared when we arrived. Everything you need (supermarket, bars, restaurants, underground) is very close to the apartment and the city center is just a few minutes away by tube. Gabriella offered her help and assistance at any time and was very flexible with arriving and departure times. I highly recommend this nice place and also Grabriella as a host."
819676,218132466,2017-12-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Great apartment, well-located with access to many of Stockholm’s main attractions, as well as local cafes and shops. Would highly recommend"
1304431,167809393,2017-07-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Madeleine's apartment is nice for families with children. It is in a quiet residential neighborhood, and it's very close to public transportation. The apartment is very clean and tastefully decorated. The bathroom has a luxurious shower. We didn't meet Madeleine during our stay, but she did email to make sure everything's okay."
164448,1877988,2012-08-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Thank you Lidia for your warm welcome even though we arrived to late. You were very helpful and gave us plenty of useful tips about Stockholm!
I would recommend Lidia and her awesome breakfast to others!"
700113,273205949,2018-06-05T00:00:00.000Z,IIona's place was perfect for everything and she was very   kind. Nice staying in Stockholm.
145320,212932349,2017-11-19T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a wonderful time during our short stay at Kim's house. She made us feel very welcome and comfortable. The communication was easy at all times. She even bought us juice, coffee and bread so we had breakfast next morning (after arriving late at night at her apartment)! We totally recommend her place. Thank you, Kim!"
916806,12023787,2014-04-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Hello, it was nice."
647314,63411736,2016-02-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Everything was great. Mallika is very nice, just as Ramses is. Her appartement is clean, big enough, cosy and very welcoming. Thank you again for hosting us."
220851,501951580,2019-08-04T00:00:00.000Z,Emplacement idéal près de restaurants plus locaux. Très belle chambre.
1212891,342714756,2018-10-29T00:00:00.000Z,wonderful host in a really comfortable home
873383,77436243,2016-05-31T00:00:00.000Z,"Isabelle is a great host, she is responsive and helpful. She helped us with everything (including the arrival from the airport to the City and her flat, she advised us the places that we should see in the city, etc.). Her appartment is very clean as you can see in the pictures. Isabelle is an easy-going person and I definitely recommend to stay at her appartment if you want to go to Stockholm and if you want to feel like you are at home. :)"
536283,148224597,2017-04-30T00:00:00.000Z,Paolo's place is perfect for one person or a couple but me and a friend managed perfectly since the matress on the Floor was really comfortable as well. The appartement is clean and well decorated. Because of the big Windows it's very bright inside which is nice. One flaw is the fact that the windows have no curtains. Besides that the wifi is a bit slow but you shouldn't be inside too much anyways when visiting Stockholm
974175,25322237,2015-01-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Fantastic, Fantastic, Fantastic.   Could not have been much better.  The location is convenient to great shopping and restaurants.  Inside, the place is just as pictured.    Comfortable living room with TV and AppleTV.  Bedrooms are spacious and comfortable.    I will be begging Sofie to let me stay there again when I come back.
  She had someone meet me to check in and walk me thru all the details.  There was french press coffee available if needed"
581243,5048443,2013-06-10T00:00:00.000Z,"It was a real pleasure to live with Edwin. He is a very hospitable friendly and smart person. His apartment has a great location: prestigious district, shopping centre and ATM on the ground floor, a 3 minutes’ walk from the subway and a 10 minutes’ walk from Djurgården. You have everything you may need in a flat; the room is very cosy and clean. Next time we visit Stockholm we surely stay at Edwin’s apartment. I advise this apartment to everybody!"
581243,268219239,2018-05-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Zeer goede en duidelijke ontvangst, Edwin heeft alles tot in de puntjes voorzien en voorbereid. Super netjes. Zeer goede ligging, kalm en met openbaar vervoer en shopping in de onmiddelijke omgeving."
1048260,197342851,2017-09-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Die Wohnung von Annika liegt am Rand von Södermalm, nahe an der U-Bahn-Station Gulmarsplan. Von da aus ist es ein Katzensprung in die Altstadt. Wenn man etwas Zeit und Lust hat, kann man auch bequem laufen. Supermarkt und Restaurants sind direkt um die Ecke. Die Wohnung ist individuell eingerichtet und dadurch sehr wohnlich. Die Zeit des Check-ins muss man absprechen, das sollte man etwas planen. Sonst lief alles problemlos, wir haben uns sehr wohlgefühlt. Danke!"
916806,367117366,2019-01-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Though we did not get to meet Julia in person (cause she was away on a trip), she was very informative and helpful with providing us the travel guides. Her place is located about 10-15mins walking distance from the train station. Do note that if you’re travelling with many baggage, it may be difficult to walk to her place as the route is mostly uphill - tough to walk especially with snow. Otherwise, it’s a cozy home"
274876,167257636,2017-07-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Very lovely flat in an upscale, quiet neighborhood.  Very close to bus lines and restaurants.  Emma was out of town during our stay, but was still available to us and always responded very quickly."
164448,95248655,2016-08-19T00:00:00.000Z,"지금까지 방문했었던 숙소 중 최고였습니다.
할머니께서 정말 친절하게 처음부터 끝까지 잘 챙겨주셨습니다.
숙소 위치도 기차역, 그리고 시내 나가는 버스타는 곳과도 가까워 편하게 다녔구요.
숙소 또한 쾌적하고 깨끗하고 (여기에 표시는 안되어있지만) 냉장고, 전자레인지도 있어요.
스톡홀름의 아름다운 기억과 함께 할머니도 잊지 못할거예요.
다시 또 방문하고 싶어요!"
1124388,15134161,2014-07-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Ездили на концерт Rolling Stones, останавливались у Карла. Ништяк! Rock and roll forever!!!"
1271843,33486084,2015-05-28T00:00:00.000Z,Andre's fiancé Johanna greeted us on arrival at their apartment and she was an absolute delight. She made us feel very welcome and offered much information on the surrounding area together with details on directions for meeting our ship. The apartment was very clean and tidy. The location was close to Gamla Stan and within walking distance of attractions. We were able to do laundry in the shared commercial washing machines and dryers. This was something you cannot always achieve when traveling. We enjoyed our stay at Johanna and Andre's cute apartment and thank you Johanna for your lovely assistance.
647314,170354069,2017-07-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Mallika was good with communication, the location was really close to nice cafe's and restaurants (however the cute bakery-cafe is closed until August unfortunately), and the room was big, filled with light, and clean. Her two cats were also very lovely. The kitchen is also beautiful and a nice spot to sit and read. Mallika stayed in a section of the living room during our stay as the apartment is one bedroom."
647314,84002214,2016-07-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Mallika's place is really nice, well decorated and idealy located (5 min from Slussen, 10 min from Gamla Stan).

Mallika is a very friendly and pleasant.

It was a really nice stay.  I highly recommend her place"
1251466,220529587,2017-12-22T00:00:00.000Z,The host canceled this reservation 6 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1048260,9255867,2013-12-16T00:00:00.000Z,"I had a great stay at Annikas place. The location was perfect. Close to the subway and the city. The apartment was cosy and I felt right at home. Annika was a really sweat host and I felt very welcomed in her home. If you'd like an harmonic place, close to the city, with an eastern touch, this is the place to stay at."
1041103,342184426,2018-10-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Karoline is a great host, the room is very cozy and there is own privacy in the room aswell. I can highly reccomend it!"
145320,403569015,2019-01-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Kim’s home is a great neighborhood, very convenient to walk to tourist sites, subway, restaurants, and grocery stores. Her home is clean and Kim quickly responds  to messages. I would recommend this rental."
299154,86279833,2016-07-15T00:00:00.000Z,Great appartement in amazing neighborhood with a lovely balcony in the evening sun... A great host with lots of information
723539,3989793,2013-04-01T00:00:00.000Z,"I went to Stockholm with 2 friends, none of us knew anything about the city, so we wanted to find a flat in the center, and that's how we ended renting Mathias' flat. 
I have to say, the flat looks exactly like in the picture : very cozy, bright, beautiful flat. It is super well located, right in the city center, where all the bars and clubs are. We didn't even have to take the metro or a cab during our stay. It is also not far from the old city, which is very pleasant to visit during the day.
Mathias was very helpful, he sent us all kind of details and information before we arrived, and was available for all the questions we had. He took us for dinner in an amazing restaurant and gave us tips about how to explore the city.
I definitely would recommand him as a host."
343925,7828356,2013-10-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Staying at Annika’s place is a great way to visit Stockholm!  The space is on the small side, but it provided a cozy place to crash in the evening and contained the cooking essentials.  The layout is a square that’s divided into smaller rooms.  The neighborhood and building were quiet and felt safe.  Annika was a very helpful, welcoming host and was there to greet us when we arrived.  She also had a huge stack of brochures and maps from past visitors that provided a lot of information about the sites of the city.  We stayed for 4 nights and so invested in the Stockholm card, which afforded us free entrance to most museums, free bus/subway transit, and a boat tour (highly recommend!).  The apartment’s location was far enough from city center to feel calm and not touristy, while also being close enough to walk to Norrmalm, Gamla Stan, and Hornstull.  There are 2 subway stops within a few blocks of the building and the Flygbussarna from Arlanda has a stop just a 5-minute walk away.  There are several grocery stores around the corner and we enjoyed meals at two local restaurants: Bee’s Thai on Kungsholmsgatan and Formaggio Pizzeria on Fleminggatan (they had gluten free crust).  Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Annika’s place: a cozy space with the essentials for a short stay, an accessible location, and a friendly host.

*If you are a coffee drinker, ask Annika about this before you stay.  We couldn’t find anything for brewing coffee and ended up buying a cheap pour-over cone."
1149820,60064644,2016-01-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Great host, nice studio flat. Perfect base for exploring Stockholm."
278311,2406569,2012-09-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Linnéa is a great host, really open minded and it is always fun to speak with. She is an amazing person. 

Her place is very near to the subway and it taxes less than 25 minutes to reach the central station and Gamla Stan (historical island).

You will enjoy your stay here! Thank you again for your nice being Linnéa :)"
1170027,36313936,2015-06-27T00:00:00.000Z,"While I did not meet Diana, only spoke to her via phone, she is a great host, attentive and communicates well.  Her father checked me in and he is also reliable and attentive and ensures that you have a good stay.      The apartment is clean, modern, in a good neighbourhood, close to grocery stores, metro, etc -  approx 20 minutes from the city centre - I would stay here again!"
1261445,460762947,2019-05-30T00:00:00.000Z,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Marie-Louise's lovely apartment:  check in was smooth, communication responsive, she thoughtfully had the fridge stocked with some great breakfast items (eggs, milk, yogurt, bread),  comfortable bed, spotlessly clean, great location in Hornstull.  Truly a home-away-from home.  Most highly recommended!"
916806,44722150,2015-08-28T00:00:00.000Z,"We had very nice stay in the apartment. The place was very clean and  fully equipped to our needs. Also the communication with Mansour was perfectly smooth. Overall, I wished we had more time to spent in the Mansour`s place."

1054406,146222367,2017-04-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Nous avons partagé ce logement à 5 (2 couples et un enfant de 4 ans). Logement impeccable, suffisamment équipé pour cuisiner. Petits supermarchés à 5 minutes en bus (il y a aussi un traiteur, un systembolaget pour l'alcool, et une pharmacie).
Pour aller à Stockholm compter 30 minutes mais très facile. Pour ceux qui restent 7 jours ne pas hésiter à prendre la carte SL à la station de métro : 30€/par personne pour les 7 jours ont l'a largement amortie !
Pour notre organisation matinale nous avons apprécié de pouvoir utiliser la douche et la baignoire en même temps (= gain de temps !).
Thomas et Madeleine sont très agréable, ils ont répondu à toutes nos questions et nous ont rendus plusieurs services (prêt de petits outils pour réparer notre poussette ! paracétamol pour notre fille ! accompagnement jusqu'à la gare pour le dernier jour).
Le lac à proximité est très agréable. Le quartier est très calme et pour les plus chanceux.....vous aurez peut être l'occasion de croiser un jeune élan dans le jardin !!! Je crois que c'était assez exceptionnel quand même !"

The location is perfect - both the commuter train and the metro always run through the stop near her place since it's one stop south of T Centralen - so you always can get home or to wherever else very quickly. The rooms are comfy and have space to put your things."

It is very close to the metro, great bars and nice restaurants (try the Pelikan for good Swedish food). His place was perfect for me, traveling alone. It was comfortable, clean and well-kept. Paolo is very responsive and communicating with him was easy. I would definitely stay at his place again if I come back to Stockholm."

The apartment has lots of charm and is cozy. Anita rents out her apartment when she does not live there herself and you can feel her personality with the books, photos, music in her house.
The contact with Anita was warm and friendly. My daughter an I can completely recommend Anita's place."
1158893,38256279,2015-07-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Our family of 7 adults were very comfortable at Dany's place. The house was clean and tidy with lots of light on both the ground- as well as the upper bed-/dayroom floor. A large deck in the back yard was an additional plus, the backyard itself was an interesting and pleasant place to be for a gardener like myself. 
Dany was extremely helpful and responsive, communication was clear. he send us lots of helpful information to get to his place and from there it was approx. about a 15-20 min car ride to down town  Stockholm."

904739,23183808,2014-11-24T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment is great and Menaf took care of everything so we can enjoy our stay. The apartment was clean and full equipped. It has big windows which make the apartment very bright even in cloudy days :)

As we stay in November when days starting to be chilly, the heaters and isolation works perfectly to keep us warm after our long walks through Stockholm.

I fully recommend stay at Menaf apartment when you visit Stockholm."

451155,33738369,2015-05-31T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed at Malin's house for 5 days and really enjoyed our time there. We did not spend that much time at her house as we loved spending time in Stockholm. The house is in a quiet neighbourhood, but is very well connected to Stockholm by public transportation. We walked to the bus station which is right down the street and took the bus to the metro station (Svedmyra). Alternatively, we could have walked to the metro station. 
We did not meet Marlin in person as she was away on a business trip, but she let us stay at her house at very short notice. She was very friendly in the email and phone communication and we are sure that it would have been a pleasure to meet her in person. The communication with her was very easy. 
The house is wonderful. It is exactly like described by Malin and shown in the pictures. We only used the kitchen for making breakfast as we ate at different restaurants in Stockholm. We stayed the bedroom with a double bed. It is a large king-size bed and extremely comfortable. As it is so quiet in the neighbourhood, we slept very well. 
We can really recommend this place a lot!"
1119738,6026753,2013-07-27T00:00:00.000Z,"We spend two nights at Anna's house in Stockholm with our 3 kids.

The hosts allowed us to check in early (10am) since our red eye flight from the USA got in very early in the morning. The location was right across the street from a beautiful park and within easy walking distance (15 min) to the harbor and Gamla Stan.  We walked everywhere. No need for a car. There were several nice grocery stores right on their street and many nice places to eat. They had a washer and dryer that we could use as well.

The apartment isn't very close to the touristic centers of Stockholm but it lies next to a beautiful path along the sea which will show you the real beauty of the city, in our opinion. And the railway network is well organised so getting to the other islands is very easy. The apartment has everything you need for a short stay in Stockholm. The only thing we didn't like was the small bed but we should have read about that beforehand. Magnus was very helpful in providing an extra mattress."

Unser Zimmer war mit einem bequemen Doppelbett ausgestattet und im Vorraum standen Kühlschrank, Mikrowelle und Wasserkocher bereit, dazu eine kleine Auswahl an Tee und Kaffee. Die Räumlichkeiten waren ausgesprochen sauber.
Wir spazierten von Lidia aus zu Fuß in die Altstadt (ca. 15 Minuten), öffentliche Verkehrsanbindung wäre ca. 150 m entfernt gewesen.
Bei einem weiteren Besuch in Stockholm würden wir jederzeit wieder bei Lidia übernachten!"

164448,13938309,2014-06-08T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed three nights here and she couldn't be more helpful. As soon as we got there she showed us how to get around and where to visit. Her place is very conveniently located to the metro station and walking distance to a market and many restaurants. Very clean and privacy was not an issue at all despite other guests staying as well. Wifi was not that reliable, but you're on vacation so it doesn't really matter :)"
1182616,54768535,2015-11-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Christer was very welcoming and warm host. He was present when we arrived at his place. The apartment is located 15 mins from the centre of Stockholm. So location wise it was perfect. The apartment comprised of a kitchen with dining space, three bed rooms and a shared toilet and bathroom. I must highlight over here that if you are bag packing then it is probably an ok place for you. But if you are visiting with family then it is an absolutely \"no no\". First of all the basin was clogging all the time and it was very dirty. The bedroom which my parents were using did not have any room for movement after an extra mattress was added for me. I had initially thought that I would get a separate room with a proper bed. The cupboard was full of dirt and the floor was also not cleaned properly, though we were asked to take off our shoes while entering the house, which we did. All in all, it was not really a pleasant experience for me as well as for my parents."
763407,293005163,2018-07-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Gabriella's apartment is spic and span, ideally situated near the underground and bus stations to move around in Stockholm. Buy a Stockholm pass including public transport! Communication with Gabriella went very smoothly, but there were a few problems since she was not the person to welcome us, but a friend of hers."
1271843,451209759,2019-05-11T00:00:00.000Z,Andre is really good in communication and giving instructions for not only how to get inside the house but also attractive places near by. the house is great with the decorations and books and it is super clean.

We had more than enough space and the apartment was very clean. Södermalm is the best part of Stockholm. It is very lively, modern close to the historic center and still in short distance to Djurgarden. There are also a lot of nice restaurants and coffeeshops, shops and musuems around, so you will never be bored. Only a few meters from the apartment you will find many nice viewing points on the old part of Stockholm.
The communication with Tilda was simple and friendly. She responded to all our questions and made our stay as easy and comfortable as possible. 
I can only recommend anyone to stay at this apartment to experience Stockholm at its best."
494569,15870708,2014-07-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Провел здесь три дня с семьей - все в полном восторге.
Замечательная квартира в очень хорошем районе, описанию соответствует полностью.
Что немаловажно для путешествующих на автомобиле - есть бесплатная парковка, причем не на улице, а на многоэтажной парковке в ста метрах от дома (насколько это, конечно, применимо, а району с 3-4 этажной застройкой) парковке в ста метрах от дома, т.е. можно за автомобиль не переживать - по Стокгольму гораздо рациональней передвигаться на метро, до которого всего насколько минут пешком.
От общения с хозяином остались только самые лучшие впечатления, надеюсь, что наше знакомство продолжится и дальше."

We are a family of four, who rented the apartment in the summer.
Christian and Karin were terrific hosts, we met a couple of times over (Hidden by Airbnb) prior to arriving, so we had the opportunity to see the apartment ahead of time and everything met our expectations.
The kitchen is well equipped and the upstairs renovations are gorgeous and makes it a perfect place for families to stay, with multiple bedrooms and bathrooms.
Location wise, this was ideal, with easy walking distance to t-bana, commuter train to airport and multiple restaurants and neighborhood shops nearby.
We had a wonderful stay, thank you!"

I always felt safe even when returning late in the evening. There is a small convenience store right on the corner for essentials like milk and juice. It is very clean and even though Jarl could not be there during my stay, he did his best to make me feel welcome in his absence. I was grateful that he had cereal and very nice coffee that I could have for breakfast.  He was very helpful and sympathetic to all my concerns, and he always answered emails promptly. The room is exactly as shown in the photos, light and well equipped. I would definitely recommend to others. Thank you Jarl!"

438129,407931608,2019-02-03T00:00:00.000Z,Allt gick bra hos Evas hus.
1244657,515051741,2019-08-22T00:00:00.000Z,"I really enjoyed my stay at Nic and Usha's place: very comfortable, spotless clean, and their apartment is located in a very convenient location (less than 10 minutes walking from Gamla Stan + right across from the major bus stops in the city). This was my first time in Stockholm, and Nic and Usha were incredibly welcoming as hosts and very friendly. I was also very impressed with the colorful chandelier in the room and with an incredible selection of books at their place!  Nic and Usha's place will definitely be my go-to place next time I visit Stockholm!"
1251466,44584235,2015-08-27T00:00:00.000Z,It was close to the metro station. Room was clean and bed really comfy. Conditions adequate to the price.
299154,23275161,2014-11-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Leiligheten til Daniel var veldig hyggelig og ligger super sentralt til. Daniel tok oss godt i mot og var i møtekommende med informasjon om Stockholm, han hadde til og med laget en liten guide og lagt frem sjokolade. En super vert!"
1212891,37714663,2015-07-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud was very lovely and welcoming from the moment we came in. The room was really small, clean, and cozy, but we slept really well. Her two cats are really cute and were an added bonus. Even though our stay was for only one night, it was great. Definitely recommend this place. She even printed out our boarding passes for us when we were checking out (which she didn't have to do, but it was really nice of her to help us out). We forgot about the check out time though and stayed a bit later than we should have, but she was very understanding."
819676,126589257,2017-01-13T00:00:00.000Z,Andy is a fantastic and considerate host and is always willing to offer help to his guests. His house is really lovely and central-located. A good choice for site seeing in the city!
1212891,268550926,2018-05-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Pour passer quelques jours à Stockholm en multipliant les visites, l'endroit est idéal ! Maud est un hôte d'une rare gentillesse et son chat est adorable !"
897730,198132348,2017-09-28T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a great time at Garp's. It exceeded our expectation. The location was excellent, very close to bus stops and the subway. 
The apartment was spotless. Would definitely stay here again. Really comfy bed, a great space for 2 people."
688947,85424010,2016-07-11T00:00:00.000Z,I had a very good time in Alexandre's appartment. It was a quiet place and I slept well. It was easy to reach the centre of Stockholm with the underground.
904739,406089612,2019-01-28T00:00:00.000Z,"a lovely person with a common sense I felt like my house, without words you need the quiet area, left me drink, butter, juice, 10 stars from my side, thanks for all my friends !!!"
628555,170849549,2017-07-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Anna is a great host, she sent me a very precise description how to find her apartment and arranged a wellcoming arrival. The apartment is sunny, friendly and well furnished.  I enjoyed particularly the proximity to the Melodybox location in Stockholm and the place was also clean I really enjoyed my stay in Anna's apartment."
900043,123196689,2016-12-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Apesar de nunca termos conhecido  a dona da casa pessoalmente, correu tudo bem com o check in/out . 
O apartamento está bem localizado , a 5  minutos ha o metro e autocarros que te levam a qualquer lugar da cidade.
Não haver televisão tudo bem mas hoje em dia penso que ter internet disponível ė essencial .
Na nossa opinião o apartamento ė bom para uma pessoa que viage sozinha , pois para um casal aquele colchão de 1.20 m ė terrível, as mantas e os lençóis que nos foram dados eram de cama de solteiro e os meus estavam um bocado rasgados .
Além de apertados aquecíamos demasiado pois duas mantas de aquecimento num espaço pequeno escusado será dizer que aqueçe bem.
Não, não  dava para usar só uma manta porque eram demasiado pequenas para duas pessoas.
Sendo inverno tivemos algumas questões com a janela da sala que tem uma pequena abertura que faz corrente de ar , tivemos de mudar o colchão de sítio ,a temperatura do apartamento não dava para regular bem pois tem um sistema bastante velho só permite ajustar os aquecedores.
Ha algum ruído vindo da rua , não nos incomodou muito , para quem está habituado a dormir com tudo escuro terá alguns problemas pois não há uma cortina que escureça um bocado.
Eu pessoalmente dormi muito mal a minha namorada um bocado melhor, é pena pois com um bocado de melhorias seria um apartamento óptimo mesmo para casais."
575371,157657250,2017-06-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Thomas and his wife were great hosts, kind, helpful, they gave us precious advice on places to visit.
Despite the late arrival hour (1 am), they welcomed us  and they also gave us  two public transport cards.
The room was small but comfortable, there was a bathroom just for us.
There has been a very good communication between us, we have been fine."
862528,90076676,2016-07-31T00:00:00.000Z,"We met Arne's family in person and they are very friendly people. Arne offered to drove us to the Kayak rental area (very kind of him). We didn't expect that. The house was very comfortable, we really liked the interior and the veranda as the weather was super for sitting outside. Our children were happy with the WiFi ;-). Communication with Arne is excellent. He quickly replied on all your questions. Very helpful host."
1182616,22661805,2014-11-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice room in Stockholm, near the metro station and have shuttle bus from ARN to his house."
757320,499205359,2019-07-31T00:00:00.000Z,"Der Raum ist sehr klein. Die Koffer unterzubringen war schwer. Die Tür lässt sich nicht abschließen! Obwohl dies im Profil angegeben ist. 

Die Badezimmertür hat nur einen kleinen Mini-Haken zum \"Abschließen\". Das Wasser der Dusche wird (nach Angabe von Barb) erst nach minutenlangem Laufen warm. 5 Minuten reichen wohl nicht, denn danach war das Wasser bei uns noch eiskalt und wir hatten aufgegeben.

Kommunikation lief ziemlich schlecht und zeitverzögert. Pünktlichkeit oder Absprachen-Einhalten war nicht ihre Stärke. 

Die Waschmaschine möchte sie eigentlich ungern benutzt haben, obwohl diese auch als Inventar angegeben war. Wir durften dann doch waschen, doch war sie sichtlich irritiert davon. 

Nach erstem Unbehagen hatten wir allerdings schon das Gefühl, dass sie sich bemühen wollte freundlich zu sein, doch haben wir sie buchstäblich nur für den sehr verspäteten Check-in und am nächsten Morgen gesehen. Danach war sie unterwegs und wieder schlecht zu erreichen."
514210,40488437,2015-07-31T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed with Margareta for 3 nights and had a great time with her. She is talkative and very helpful. The room we stayed in was clean and spacious with a comfortable bed, the balcony was filled with flowers and had a beautiful view, great for having a cup of tea in the mornings. We got space in the fridge and were able to use the kitchen for home cooked meals. The city center and Old Town were easy to reach with the bus that stops three minutes from her place. She provided us with travel cards for the public transport. There was also a store nearby where you can get groceries for a reasonable price. Thank you for making us welcome Margaret. If there will be a next time we would like to stay with her again and we would recommend this place to everybody."
1054406,273781070,2018-06-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Wir sind mit einem 2 jährigen Kind nach Stockholm gereist und haben uns sehr sehr wohl gefühlt bei Thomas und Madeleine. Die Gastgeber sind sehr freundlich und zugewandt und unser täglicher Besuch bei den Hasen war nur eins der Highlights.
Direkt nebenan ist ein wunderschöner Badesee und ein tolles schwedisches Café. Spielplätze sind auch in der Nähe. Die Bus und Bahnverbindung sind sehr gut. Innerhalb von 30 Minuten ist man in Gamla Stan (Altstadt). 
Wir können die Unterkunft wärmstens empfehlen und würden jederzeit wiederkommen!"
904739,17859041,2014-08-18T00:00:00.000Z,Menaf met me when I arrived and was extremely helpful. His apartment was larger than expected for a studio and was extremely clean. It's located in a perfect area just minutes from local coffee shops and the T. His street is very quiet but minutes from the center of the nightlife.I wanted to stay longer but he was returning from a vacation. LOVED this place. Highly recommend staying here.
1271843,517352004,2019-08-25T00:00:00.000Z,"You couldn’t ask more from a host. Our stay was delightful, and the apartment had everything we needed. Great location and easy access. Highly recommend"
1170766,21894113,2014-10-26T00:00:00.000Z,"This apartment is my new favorite place to stay in Stockholm (and I already had another hostess I loved). The location is excellent, in a fun and lively neighborhood, 2 minutes from the subway and a good supermarket, not to mention bars, shops and a major theater. The space is easily 3x as large as I'd expected, full of windows and skylights - plus the porch, which bad weather sadly kept me away from. The kitchen is well equipped, the bed is very comfortable, and Annika is a kind and attentive hostess -- conveniently just downstairs if you need her! Only 2 small warnings: 1) this is an attic apartment in a 4-story walk-up building on a hilltop; and 2) if you need a dark room to sleep, consider bringing an eye mask -- there are shades, of course, but also skylights. Overall, an A-quality spot. Will be back."
242188,5207108,2013-06-18T00:00:00.000Z,Lidia is very friendly and gives you tipps at the arrival. I came in the morning and could leave my luggage there. There is a shared bathroom for all guests which was clean and a common area with micro wave and fridge where you could eat in the evening.
514210,505288149,2019-08-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Margareta's place is nice as mentioned by previous guests.
We enjoyed our daily walks in the forest.
However, I would like to say something about the bed which is soft and not really a double bed as we expected.  This can be an issue for anyone with back problems."
565912,286014068,2018-07-05T00:00:00.000Z,Lovely place with good access to public transport and restaurants
776012,518759374,2019-08-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Beautiful old apartment on quiet lane, in the heart of old city.  Rooftop views, full of character, well equipped, with a warm welcome.  Perfect."
565912,14858803,2014-06-28T00:00:00.000Z,Patrik is a wonderful host. I was able to get the keys a day earlier because my family was arriving on a very early flight. Also he was helpful in explaining how to fix the internet. The only issue was I didn't know the house was 3 floors and the 2nd to 3rd floor was little steep for older people. Otherwise I has a very lovely stay and I would definitely recommend this place to friends.
442837,101792035,2016-09-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Jo was a fabulous host, very welcoming and was very quick & easy to communicate with. 
Great space and very accurate to the description provided. The location was very  quiet, yet only 2 min to the t-bana with 5-10 min into the centre of Stockholm.
I would highly recommend Jo as a host for a stay in Stockholm."

It's just in front of a lovely park and close to Hornstull metro station, which is very close to Slussen. Thank you very much Marie-Louise for making us feel at home ( chips, fruits, and all the kind explanations given by Bianca :-)). I highly recommend this place!"
900043,73390074,2016-05-08T00:00:00.000Z,Overall good experience. Good location very close to the metro station and to a pub. Cosy flat small but enough for 2 friend like us. Points for improvement; needs Internet connexion and a TV
259025,53317655,2015-11-08T00:00:00.000Z,The house is very clean and well maintained. Ali helped us with all kinds of information required about/ in Stockholm.

1248490,295214195,2018-07-23T00:00:00.000Z,"If you are going to Stockholm, staying in Sodermalm is a must, great vibe great eats and easy transportation to major sites of Stockholm.  Quite affordable real local feel, kinda like Brownsville, the village of nyc."
581243,4517036,2013-05-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin was a great host. He was very kind to wait for us until very late at night on our arrival. The room is clean and perfectly located in Stockholm. We walked everywhere and only took the metro once to get to the train station. 
In all we had a very nice time."
206221,12498128,2014-05-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Elisabeth a l'art de vous mettre à l'aise avec le sourire. Le quartier où elle vit est très calme et facile d'accès; et il y a de nombreux restaurants et bars à proximité.
On discute le matin autour d'un excellent petit-déjeuner et Elisabeth peut vous conseiller des visites et des activités intéressantes.
Bref, l'adresse est excellente, l'hôtesse aimable et souriante. A recommander!"
536691,164693296,2017-06-28T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment was spacious and contained everything we needed for our stay. It was close to a metro station and supermarket, which was very convenient. The apartment was super quirky, with lots of different artworks and eccentric furniture. Cecilia communicated with us clearly through air bnb with regards to checking in and out. The only recommendation I would have is to include a shower curtain as water would go everywhere when taking a shower. Overall, a very enjoyable stay in Stockholm!"
688947,89555227,2016-07-29T00:00:00.000Z,"we enjoyed Alexandre's place. He was kind and helpful, special when we arrived to help us to describe his place to our friend, where we are.
He also played on his drums for me, immediately when I asked him. 
His place is clean and quite, a prefect place where you can begin you trip to Stockholm and around. Lot of ways to take a walk. All what you need is close to his apartment."
974175,17852946,2014-08-18T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment is absolutely amazing, well located and Sofie made our stay in Stockholm just perfect. Certainly recommend this apartment!"
845365,137235904,2017-03-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Very comfortably room. Clean appartment, good connected to the city center, near metro station. And the most important, appartment with relaxed and homelike atmosphere."

the apartment is very nice design .
host as we well received .
I highly recommend it."
556363,455827762,2019-05-20T00:00:00.000Z,"In general the apartment looks like in the pictures, nevertheless there were a lot of unarranged things: the conditions of the apartment are not accurate, there are various details on the walls, the kitchen board and the bathroom (the toilet seat is broken and there was hair on the shower). The place was not cleaned properly, there was dust everywhere and the used candles were not thrown away. Also, there were dirty dishes inside the dishwasher and the cupboards were badly organised and messy.  The closets or the storage space in the bathroom are not available. 
Overall, the price mandated does not correspond with the conditions of the apartment. There was a lack of interest in giving the guests an enjoyable experience, not mentioning the fact that the host asked me if someone could enter the apartment while we were inside (I totally understand is their property, but one is paying for a service and that also includes privacy and safety). 
The apartment itself has a lot of potential to be a nice and sophisticated space but the furniture and general conditions of the apartment leave a lot to wish for. I would not recommend  this space for that amount of money."
954832,46919502,2015-09-14T00:00:00.000Z,"My husband and I had one of the best experiences on AirBnB by staying at Mikael's. The apartment was cozy and had everything we needed. It even had things you normally forget to bring (umbrellas, outlet adapters, maps, etc). The place was about a 30min walk from the city center which I loved. It was nice to feel as if I actually lived in Stockholm but know I could get to the center easily. 

The apartment was very easy to get to from the airport and had many transportation options nearby, which we didn't need since it was so easy to get around by walking, and Mikael showed up some walking routes that were simply gorgeous. The surrounding area had goods places to eat, drink, sip some coffee and a great supermarket.

Mikael himself was a truly amazing host. He made us feel as if we were visiting a friend or relative. He was always available if we needed him and responded to texts/emails quickly. He also gave us great recommendations on where to eat and drink.  I cannot say enough nice things about both Mikael and the place. My only disappointment was having to leave!"
900043,98306966,2016-08-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Annelie's flat is very cool. Great location and nice space. The only drawbacks are the lack of wifi and the noise from the street, but it's definitely worth the price, and the noise from the street is probably unavoidable in such a central location."
608672,201446439,2017-10-08T00:00:00.000Z,We had a great time in Stockholm! The room was in an excellent location and we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Thank you Karl
242188,61115258,2016-01-31T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia's place is a perfect accomodation in heart of Södermalm. I had never used bus in Sthlm and she was super helpfull whenever I needed tips about local traffic and other stuff. 

Rooms were very cozy and you get a key to your own so it's totally safe as well - even though there might ne other ppl staying there as well. 

Simply excellent experience. Would totally recommend and go again!"
451155,142668393,2017-04-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Mooi en gezellig huis in een rustige buitenwijk van Stockholm, ten zuiden van het centrum. Een kwartiertje stappen naar het dichtsbijzijnde metrostation Smedvyra. Of 5' stappen en dan bus 163 naar de metro :)
Mooie groene omgeving, we zagen 's ochtends zelfs jonge rendieren in de tuin. Handig ook dat de keuken volledig voorzien is, zodat je niet voor kruiden of wat zout naar de supermarkt moet. Kortom, een aanrader voor wie Stockholm wil ontdekken tijdens een citytrip."
897584,256947576,2018-04-24T00:00:00.000Z,Viveka is very friendly and the place really comfortable and quite. Actually we think it's a great place where to stay in Stockholm.

The apartment was perfect and couldn't be more conveniently located (right above a modern shopping mall, and only a few stairs to the metro, and ~10mins. to Stockholm Central), and in such a beautiful neighbourhood!

I would highly recommend Edwin to anyone else looking for a clean, quiet, and comfortable stay in Stockholm and I would certainly come back for another stay the next time I'm in Stockholm!"
1248490,58526861,2016-01-03T00:00:00.000Z,Maria is a great host and the apartment was perfect for us. It's clean and we had so much space!

628555,55399441,2015-12-01T00:00:00.000Z,Anna's home was perfect for our weekend stay. Easy access to the centre of Stockholm without being right in the thick of it. The apartment was clean and tidy and Anna was very helpful with the information she provided us with. Would recommend. Thanks :)

Everything was as expected, the practical details where sorted without hassle. The apartment is a little cold and there is some minor tumbling noise from the roof, but other than that it was perfect for my needs."
916806,74011408,2016-05-12T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment was really nice, fully and modern equipped and very clean.

164448,2516647,2012-10-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia is a wonderful host. She's very welcoming, showed us places where we could go in Stockholm and gave helpful tips. When we decided to go to Tom Tits museum, she got actual directions for public transport for us which was very nice of her. 
Even though there were several people staying in other rooms at her apartment at the time we were staying, it was absolutely fine and we didn't feel any inconvenience at all. 
I highly recommend staying at Lidia's place. It is great value and experience for staying at the center of Stockholm."
1048260,478690054,2019-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,"I had a wonderful stay in Annikas apartment. Annika is so sweet and helpful with every question, and she wrote me a perfect guide to find the apartment and check in. In the apartment I was met with clean sheets and in the kitchen there were tea, coffee, bread and so for my breakfast. The surroundings are quiet, and the metro is near by. Also the apartment is in walking distance to the beautiful water by Skanstull Marine."
700113,284739544,2018-07-02T00:00:00.000Z,Ilona was a great host.  It's a perfect location for a small family.  The location was perfect in the city of Stockholm and to public transportation.   I reccomend her studio to anyone traveling to the city center.

1212891,101612473,2016-09-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud was a lovely host and her apartment is very charming. I stayed in the purple room with a single bed which was very comfortable. She was feeling under the weather but still made an effort to find out about my trip and answer any questions I had. I had an evening flight and she let me leave my bags in her living room until I needed to get to the airport. 

The only cons I have are 9 am check out (too early). And the location is pretty far from the city center (15 min drive). I was only in Stockholm for a day and a half so I ended up taking Ubers everywhere rather than transit to save time. That got very expensive. Looking back I wish I payed more and stayed in the town center since I was there for such a short time. I absolutely recommend her house for longer trips but for 1-2 days I wouldn't go back. 

Thank you Maud for the lovely time in Stockholm!
Shannon"

Margareta was so accommodating and her place was adorable. She left special touches throughout her place and it was so easy to check in. It felt like my home away from home.

Jo has been great!"
283446,35031075,2015-06-14T00:00:00.000Z,"It was such a nice place to stay.  Vidhi and her family were very nice and welcomed us with hospitality :) Her place is clean and has fast wifi.
Location is also great, just a few minutes walk from Akalla station (20min from Central station) so it has easy access to everywhere. 
We had to leave her place really early morning but they were super kind enough to saw us off. I highly recommend you to stay her place if you come to Stockholm.

Vidhiと彼女の家族はとても親切で､素敵なｽﾄｯｸﾎﾙﾑでの時間を過ごすことができました｡駅からも徒歩4,5分と近く､ｽﾄｯｸﾎﾙﾑ中央駅からも直通の地下鉄で20分と場所もとても便利です｡困ったことがあれば親切に教えてくれるので朝早い飛行機でも安心でした｡とてもおすすめです!"

The apartment is very clean and beautifully decorated. There is much more seating than what is shown in the pictures, including a table for dining for 4. It was the perfect size for myself, my partner, and the other couple we were traveling with. Matilda was very sweet and quick to respond to any question we had before and during our stay!"

I was greeted with a warm smile, a big hug, a very very clean pad, and even some light refreshments waiting for me in the fridge. I was definitely glad to have spent another few weeks with her as the place was immaculate, true to description, and easy to recommend to fellow coworkers and friends who would be traveling to Stockholm."

1158893,318673047,2018-09-04T00:00:00.000Z,"My family loved our stay at this house.  We had two toddlers with us and the yard was just perfect for them to run around and enjoy.  They spent hours on the trampoline and really enjoyed eating fruit and veggies straight from the garden.
Dany was a wonderful host, gave us a ton of helpful information for our stay, and really made us feel like the home was ours.  It is about a 15 minute walk to either of the 2 convenient train stations, but we did it a number of times with strollers and it was no problem at all.  The beach is about a 25-30 minute walk, but it was very cute. 
We would absolutely recommend this house to families hoping to explore Stockholm and still experience all the comforts of home.  We had an amazing time!"
776155,37132404,2015-07-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Everything about Ann-Sofie’s apartment is just perfect and we really enjoyed our 5 night stay there.  It is spacious, beautifully furnished, superbly equipped and has many quirky features that make it feel very unique and special. The apartment is every bit as good as the photos would indicate and was spotlessly clean.
 The weather was hot at the time of our visit but the numerous windows and door to the balcony make it feel airy and also very light. (The bedroom’s blackout blinds were ideal for the light nights!)
The location is quiet and very convenient for the Odenplan metro station and therefore easy and quick to get to locations all over Stockholm.
We did not meet Ann-Sofie but her communications and instructions were prompt, helpful and clear; so consequently there was no problem with anything.
We would unreservedly and highly recommend this apartment; why would you consider a hotel when you could stay somewhere as lovely as this?"

The space is as-advertised and the room is comfortable with lovely decor and tea and water in the room. The location is excellent and close to Gamla Stan. 

I had some trouble with checking in, as the safe for the key is a bit confusing as it is not a typical digital safe, but a kind neighbour was able to help me unlock it and Mallika followed up soon after. Otherwise all went smoothly :)"

The smiles on your faces when you will enter this place after battling in the cold snow!
Experience all the comfort and practicality of this great apartment where everything is well thought-of. There is plenty of room, the balcony is giving into a peaceful internal courtyard. The shower was very nice too!
Location is in a nice street, close to metro station, small park, and available restaurants. Moreover just going down the street is the beginning of a nice walk alongside the river, up the hill and to Monteliusvagen.
Madeleine & PO were very accommodating and even let us leave our luggage until the sunday night when we left."
944703,503038319,2019-08-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Christina and Frida were wonderful hosts and could not have have been more accommodating and communicative throughout.  Flight cancellations and delays meant that my arrival at the apartment became something of a moving target, but they made alternate arrangements so that my entry to the apartment late in the night after a long travel day was seamless.  The apartment was ideal - cozy, clean, well-equipped and in a great location.  The neighbourhood was very quiet and the station for the train into central Stockholm was only a few minutes' walk away.  There is a grocery store only 5 minutes away, and that was incredibly convenient, given the cost of eating out in Stockholm.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and am looking forward to booking again when I come back to Stockholm."
581243,9033773,2013-12-02T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a quick overnight stay with Edwin, so we didn't see him much, but he was extremely communicative beforehand and was flexible with our schedule day off. 

The apartment was in a central location - right off of a metro stop, so easy to get around town. Room was cosy and clean. Recommend!"

The neighborhood was beautiful, full of cafes, restaurants, parks and vintage & design shopping. Easy access to subway too. 

Apartment had lovely artistic details, and description of apartment was accurate. Thank you so much!"

During my stay I was alone in the apartment. Check-In and contact was ok, I would have appreciated a quicker response to my messages. The room is large, comfortable king-size bed, big wardrobe, everything very clean. I recommend Polina's apartment."
944703,17788965,2014-08-17T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed for 6 days in Christinas apartment.
Christina was a nice and helpful host.
We really loved her apartment and recommand it from the bottom of our heart.
Especially the short distance to the underground (1  minute), was a reason
for choosing Christinas apartment.
Inspite of this fact it was really calm.
We really appreciate our stay and will choose it again."

Her home is well furnished and our family of 4 adults and 2 children ages 2 and 4 enjoyed staying there.  The neighborhood is great with cafes and restaurants and walking distance to many stores.  We would definitely stay there again and thank Emma for making our stay in Stockholm and enjoyable one!
838442,65388220,2016-03-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Don't be fooled by the fact this place sits within a backpackers - if you're going with a handful of mates for a few days, you won't find a better & cheaper place.
Self-contained and centrally located, we'd happily go again. It's a 15-20min walk into Södermalm and close to the central train & bus station. 
The backpackers itself also has great shared facilities which was an added bonus....although the sauna is sadly shared, not private."
514210,329977265,2018-09-30T00:00:00.000Z,"A cosy and very tidy room with its own small bathroom in an appartment outside Stockholm. Well-connected by public transportation. If you don't want to stay in the city center, than this is your place."
581243,22400737,2014-11-05T00:00:00.000Z,Edwin is very friendly and helpful. He gave us a very detailed paper about how to get to the house. And it is very convenient to get to. The room is clean and nice. Very nice stay.

I would definitely highly recommend this place. The only thing I would note is that the bed is more of a twin bed than a double (by American standards). The two of us are fit but 6'1 and 5'9\" respectively. The bathroom was nice and clean. Great stay overall!"
533880,2516757,2012-10-05T00:00:00.000Z,The title is perfect: the room is indeed very nice and very calm. You can reach it with a short walk from the center of the town. Jarl has been very helpful and very welcoming. Highly reccomended.

The rooms were located upstairs, which she uses as a separate area for anybody staying there. This was nice as it created a common room space and it allowed for a separate space for the guests and the host. She also gave me a nice rundown of things to do in Stockholm when I first arrived and had suggestions whenever I needed them."

164448,38631927,2015-07-17T00:00:00.000Z,Lidia's apartment is in a great spot for sightseeing around Stockholm. We walked everywhere and it was no problem. She was out of town for most of our stay but arranged to make everything go as smoothly as possible in her absence. Only hitch was the WIFI didn't work in our bedroom; we could only use it in the common area. No big deal though this was a great apartment for our needs!

I was working non-stop so we didn't see each other much but I had everything I needed, and the apartment was super clean and done to high standards. Like being in a hotel! the bathroom was really nice, with heated floor tiles. 

I stayed for a month and would have stayed longer, but I needed a fuller kitchen - there is no oven, kettle, toaster etc. Mikael was happy for me to use his oven, but I was working long antisocial hours! 

The complex is safe with a key/pin access and there is a sauna, limited gym and big laundry room in the building!

Thanks Mikael for everything!"

I enjoyed very much my vacation there and I sure recommend the place to others. 
Thanks Lidia one more time for everything."

The t-bana is a short walk and it is very easy to get around Stockholm from the apartment. There is a Stockholm shower which we found to be no issue. Marie-Louise had stocked the kitchen with lots of food choices and fresh fruit, coffee, bread, eggs and milk - there are two grocery stores nearby so getting any other foods was very easy. As an added bonus the view of the church across the street was beautiful at all times of the day. Thank you Marie-Louise for such a delightful place to stay while visiting Stockholm! Susan and Peter"
1048260,283219354,2018-06-29T00:00:00.000Z,Very near metro stop (4-5 stops to Central Stockholm and all tourist sites). We checked in at 3am and host left keys in a nearby 7-11 which is open 24/7. Highly recommended
838442,77766766,2016-06-03T00:00:00.000Z,"First, the location is great and the people staying at the hostel were very nice.  However, I did not feel good about the experience.  First, the apartment pictured in the ad is not the apartment we received.   Second, the ad said it is a two bedroom apartment.  It was a one bedroom with four bunkbeds.  Third, the clothes washer pictured is not in your apartment.  It is in the basement of the building and accessible to everyone else staying in the building.  This means you can hang out in the basement and guard your clothes or you can skip using the laundry.   Fourth, the \"private sauna\" described and pictured in the ad is not in your apartment.  It is also in the basement of the building and, if I understood the instructions, turned on for one hour a day for men and one hour a day for women.  Fifth, after we were in Norway we received an email which said: \"I just want to be clear beforehand this apartment is part of our hostel ....\"  The email then informed us that we would need to rent sheets and towels unless we brought your own.  If you really want to be perfectly clear about something, put that information in the ad before someone rents the place.   Sixth, this is a commercial establishment (hostel) advertising on Airbnb.  There is no host/guest relationship.  We were shown to our apartment by the clerk managing the front desk.  Summary:  Good location but not as advertised."

It was very close to the station, and within walking distance of all the major sites in the city. The space itself was very clean, and well-suited to travellers staying in Stockholm on city breaks, with a small pantry/kitchen I used to make lunch to take out with me around the city. Check in was very easy, and Karin and Karl were very responsive to messages throughout the trip. Would definitely recommend staying here to friends!"

Edwin et sa femme étaient très accueillants et accommodants : nous avons pu déposer nos sacs dans l'appartement tôt le matin après être descendues du ferry et nous avons pu les y laisser la journée où nous partions pour pouvoir visiter tranquillement. Edwin nous avait également envoyé un mail très précis pour arriver jusqu'à l'appartement, qui était donc très facile à trouver. Je recommande !"

Sodermalm is a wonderful spot with hip shops, restaurants, and cafes. The location of Daniel's apartment allows you to check out all of that out plus a quick walk into Gamla Stan and Central Stockholm. Also very easy to get to the train to/from the airport. Highly recommend!"

916806,6170711,2013-08-02T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment of Mansour is very modern and clean with good beds. It is a good place to stay when you want to explore Stockholm while nature is at your doorstep. We've even seen deers in the backyard! It was easy to communicate with Mansour even though he was on holiday. For immediate questions we could contact a close friend or their very friendly neighbour.

The panoramic view is there but only at the other side of the house where Mansour lives. We really had to get used to the fact the sewer couldn't handle toilet paper.

Please keep in mind that if you use the sheets (and towels) you have to pay for them as the bed is already made when you arrive.

We really would recommend this place!"

The apartment is awesome, an independent under-roof attic with kitchen, bathroom, tv and everything we could request.
The area around is wonderful, very close to the metro and to a panoramic viewpoint. Furthermore it's very easy to go to the city center by walk in 10-15 minutes.

Annika è una padrona di casa veramente gentile e disponibile. Ha sempre risposto velocemente e in maniera comprensibile.
L'appartamento è stupendo, un sottotetto-mansarda indipendente con cucina, bagno, tv e tutto il necessario.

The interior design is very, very well done, we (both architects) felt home and at ease immediately. The apartment is on the third floor (no lift) and clean. The neighbourhood is absolutely quiet; we have not heard any neighbours. From far away you can hear the freeway which was not a problem at all. The bathroom is really tiny – but the big bed very comfortable (I slept heavenly during the three nights). Although we did not stay much at the apartment, we enjoyed the comfy huge couch and the living room.
Anna, thank you for letting us stay at your beautiful place!"

Gleich um die Ecke ist ein schöner Spielplatz, zum Wasser mit Bademöglichkeiten läuft man knapp 20 min. Im Haus war alles, was man brauchte, bei Fragen antwortete Arne immer prompt und unkompliziert.

Daniel could not have done more for us and he proved to be responsive throughout the booking process and reliable at check-in.  An unreserved recommendation from us.  If you are in Stockholm you only need a place to lay your head for a few hours until you can get back out into the city and Daniels's place is perfect for that!

I stayed there for 5 days.
He has some shops, supermarkets and post office below of the apartment.
The subway station is very close.
So, It's really convenient.
It was the first trip to Sweden for me.
I was bit nervous before I go.
When I got the apartment around 10 in the evening,
I couldn't enter it, However Edwin found me and took me to the room.
I also wanted to go to the small village where it takes 3 hours by train from Stockholm.
He booked the train ticket to there.
When I had a question, He always opened mind and answered it.
I didn't have any trouble in Sweden.
It was because of him.
I am very thankful to him. 
If my friends want to go to Stockholm, I'll recommend them to stay his house.
I also want to go back to Sweden and his apartment."

We really felt like we were experiencing the \"real\" Stockholm. The house is in a lovely quiet neighbourhood and Dany was really thorough in giving us directions to the house from Stockholm centre. It was really easy to find (even at eleven o'clock at night with a suitcase) and was a great base for going in and out of Stockholm using the Tunnelbanna. Dany even told us how to get a travel card which we used for our whole journey.  

Even though there were 6 women all staying in the house, there was plenty of space and all of the facilities accommodated us really well, the shower room was lovely and the upstairs living space was great for sitting and chatting. Dany was a fantastic and attentive host, he really tried to make sure we got the most out of our trip, providing me with suggestions for places to visit and eat in Stockholm (we took his advice and went to a restaurant called Luzette, which was lovely) and also helping us to find the best way to travel from the airport. We had a fantastic trip and staying here played a big part in how much we enjoyed ourselves!"

916806,39006102,2015-07-20T00:00:00.000Z,"This place is amazing! Mansour was not in town when we got there but made sure we had everything we needed in advance which was great. The location was beautiful, far enough out of town that it wasn't crowded and a lot of traffic but close enough we could drive anywhere we wanted within about 10 minutes. The apartment itself is beautiful. It was extremely clean and well maintained. We stayed during the time of the midnight sun and the blinds kept it nice and dark for us at night. It was furnished with everything we could have needed. The one and only downside was you had to walk up hill to get there from the parking lot, and it's not even a big hill, we were just tired a lot from jet lag. That is the only negative I could ever say about this place. If we ever come back we will definitely stay here again and I will recommend this place to anyone."

The room is very nice as well, having your own key and being able to come and go gave me the flexibility to see the city and take breaks as need be.

1054406,269408156,2018-05-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Das erste Mal Schweden. Stockholm um genau zu sein. 6 Tage. Zwei Erwachsene, eine 12-jährige und ein quirliger 5-jähriger. Dann dieses Appartment, diese Lage, die wärmsten Tage seit Wetteraufzeichnung und tolle Gastgeber. Ein Traum. 

Gute Kommunikation und Beschreibung von Thomas haben uns die Ankunft erleichtert. Wir wurden sogar vom und am Ende zum Bahnhof per Auto abgeholt bzw. gebracht. Top-Service. 

Unterkunft und Lage: Sieht aus wie auf den Bildern. Sehr grosszügig geschnitten. Betten für uns sehr bequem und ohne Rückenschmerzen. Alles vorhanden. Inkl. Geschirrspüler und Waschmaschine. Zu unserer Überraschung war der Kühlschrank gefüllt mit Bier, Wein, Wasser, Saft, Milch, Schoki, Butter, Käse, Schinken und zudem noch Brot, Nudeln und Müsli (letzteres glaube ich von Vorgängern). Top-Service. 
Gutes Wlan auch mit 4 Geräten gleichzeitig. 

In 3 Minuten ist man an eine idyllischen See, alte Apfelbäume wurden zum Klettern benutzt und ein uriges Cafe lud zum Pausieren ein. In 17 Minuten zu Fuss ist ein gut ausgestatter Supermarkt. 4 Geh-Minuten zur Bushaltestelle nach Fruängen und Älvsjo. Wir sind immer nach Fruängen gefahren, dort im Supermarkt Proviant besorgt und dann mit der Bahn nach Stockholm City. Rückweg das umgekehrte Programm inkl. Einkauf. Am besten schon am Flughafen bei der Ankunft SL Karten (je 20Kr) kaufen, dann 72-Stunden- oder wie wir Wochenkarte kaufen. Spart Geld.


Etwas Negatives gab es für uns nicht. Wir haben uns „fast“ wie zu Hause gefühlt. ;)"

The room was perfect - big, clean, and with the balcony. The apartment was nice and I made fast friends with the other B&B guests. Peter was pleasant and accommodating. The neighborhood was perfect and close to the attractions. And the Champion's League final was playing in the bar downstairs and my favorite player scored the decisive goal. So yes, I had an amazing stay. My only regret is that my wife wasn't there to share it with me. Thank you Peter!"
954832,261806407,2018-05-07T00:00:00.000Z,"L'estudi és petitó, però suficient per a parella i bebè. No és molt a prop del centre , però tens busos i el metro allà mateix. O si no,amb una caminadeta d'uns 40 minuts per la vora de l'aigua (molt bonic) també hi arribes.
Hospitalitat excel·lent. Hi tornaríem sens dubte."
283446,41666639,2015-08-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Firstly, I was given very clear instructions on how to get to the apartment, which is located very conveniently close to a metro station. Vidhatri's husband Bala came and greeted me at the metro station, which was great. The room was spacious and clean, and I received a very warm welcome (with cookies and tea). Additionally, Vidhatri was kind enough to cook me dinner on my first day of arriving. The breakfasts everyday were great - South Indian homecooked food all the way in Sweden. The entire family is friendly and very helpful. Overall, it was a great stay and I would recommend this airbnb to others visiting Stockholm."
299154,169321191,2017-07-12T00:00:00.000Z,Daniel was great! He was super friendly and helpful.
608672,102969517,2016-09-19T00:00:00.000Z,Great studio flat in a good location for exploring Stockholm. Everything walkable but hiring the city bikes made for a cool mode of transport! Karl was really helpful - recommended.
299154,282822905,2018-06-28T00:00:00.000Z,"L'appartement de Daniel est vraiment petit, il est propre mais très chargé par ses affaires, ce qui ne facilite pas vraiment l'appropriation des lieux, pour faire la cuisine, se détendre etc.. Nous étions deux adultes et un enfant et vraiment c'était top juste.
Propreté partout mais maure de soin dans certains équipements, de cuisine, ou évacuation lavabo ou baignoire.
Linge propre à priori mais pas repassé.
Travaux dès 6h du matin juste en face, impossible de dormir... le prix n'était pas justifié pour moi..
Mais Daniel est très gentil et accès facile à l'appartement, même à 1h du matin! Idéalement situé."
819676,100642000,2016-09-10T00:00:00.000Z,I really enjoyed staying in Andy & Vannie's house! It's very closed to the Slussen station which only takes 5min from central city and also walkable to the Oldtown. And the house is so cozy and clean and Andy was very helpful for any information. It was so convenient to use the private bathroom that is just in front of the room! I will definitely visit Stockholm again and will stay here again ;)
1304431,16548850,2014-07-29T00:00:00.000Z,A beautiful apartment – high quality décor and fixtures & fittings – the perfect relaxing base from which we could easily explore the delights of Stockholm. And with the added bonus of a delightful balcony and outside courtyard space in which to enjoy the best of the Swedish sunshine. Arrangements with Madeleine were welcoming and straightforward. Made for a thoroughly enjoyable visit to Stockholm – we’ll be back! Highly recommended!

259025,1503410,2012-06-18T00:00:00.000Z,Ali was a very nice host. We had a bit of confusion finding the place so he came and picked up our suitcase in the city and left us the key.
819676,175075289,2017-07-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Andy and Vannie are great and friendly hosts! Andy gave us some bar/ restaurant recommendations, which helped us have a great experience in Stockholmes. He was available to answer our questions when needed. We enjoyed the great location (close to Slussen station, walking distance to Gamla Stan, lots of hip bars and cafes, grocery stores, etc.). Highly recommended!"
1124388,266118123,2018-05-19T00:00:00.000Z,Nice cozy place and walkable to many places....Carl is a good host

274876,181749466,2017-08-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Emma is een vriendelijke gastvrouw en heeft ons bij aankomst goede tips gegeven over de omgeving. Het mooie appartement bevind zich in een rustige nette wijk, maar toch op enkele minuten lopen afstand van winkelcentra, musea en knooppunten voor het openbaar vervoer. We hadden een Stockholm pass gekocht waarmee we toegang hadden tot 60 bezienswaardigheden, en de hop-on-hop-off boot, die op 10 minuten loopafstand van het appartement een stopplaats heeft."
904739,25946155,2015-01-30T00:00:00.000Z,"While the apartment is by no means luxurious, although quite spacious, Menaf was an extremely prompt and accommodating host. The location is pretty much perfect, situated in Stockholm's lively Södermalm district."
1189469,6280379,2013-08-06T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed there for 5 days. It is a very beautiful Apartment and very clean. When we arrived, it was newly renovated. Jorgen was very kind and helpful during the stay.

Directly in front of the Apartment you have a park to go for a walk and relax. Just 3 minutes away is the central place of the city with restaurants, bars and clubs. But when you're not in the mood to go out, the Apartment is perfect to hang out. Cook diner first in the modern kitchen and after that watch a movie on the big tv in the living room with a cool sound system. For those who like good entertainment, you will be in the right place. It's so comfortable, that my friends just wanted to take a nap in the afternoon, sleeped for few hours.

Stockholm was a very nice experience for us, with a really cool and modern Apartment to stay. I recommend it to anyone who will stay in Stockolm for few days.

Thanks to Jorgen and Isabelle"
1272348,164480954,2017-06-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Magnus is really helpful, he answers to all of my questions really fast. His apartment is close to public transport and supermarket. Had a great stay at Stockholm"

1139359,167363687,2017-07-06T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment was beyond our expectations!  We felt that it was even bigger and better in person than it was in the pictures. Everything was very, very clean!  The kitchen was very well equipped & we ate breakfast there every morning.  Cecilia and her mother went ABOVE and beyond for accommodating us as we were traveling with two very small children. We couldn't believe how thoughtful they were (a travel bed & changing pad for my son & a booster chair for my daughter!  So considerate.).  Communication was very efficient & we get so welcomed. The building was quiet & safe. It was in a wonderful location- walking distance to parks, restaurants, cafes, transit & Old Town.  We can't say enough good this place we called \"home\" for our stay in Stockholm.  Thank you Cecilia for helping us create beautiful memories for our family."
739726,3437722,2013-01-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Staying at Sanna's was a great experience! Her flat is so comfortable that you feel at home instantly. She gave us really nice addresses of bars and restaurants in her neighborhood, which is really lively. So, thank you Sanna!"
568341,428590528,2019-03-25T00:00:00.000Z,"A very interesting tour through some Capitol buildings, including the library (this one is a gem). Note: the entrance to the Senate is not included, it should be scheduled through the government agency."

274876,41923680,2015-08-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Emma's place was really fantastic! We really liked the location in Sodermalm - it's close to cool cafes, bakeries, restaurants, and boutiques. It was relatively easy to get to with very frequent bus service nearby. We appreciated the fun decor of the apartment and the nice little touches like the balcony overlooking the courtyard, extra charging cords for the electronics, and cool furniture. This would be an ideal place for a couple, a small group, or a family.

Emma was a great host. She took the time to meet us in person and give suggestions on what to see in Stockholm. She was very responsive with inquiries that we had during our stay. I would highly recommend this place!"
608672,30687774,2015-04-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Karl is a really nice owner, the apartment is not very big, but really comfortable, everything you need is inside. Very good place to stay in Stockholm."
274876,279945629,2018-06-22T00:00:00.000Z,"We wanted a place away from regular tourist crowds, but in a fun neighborhood. Emma’s place was perfect! Easy walking all around SoFo, easy access to rest of city. Emma knows some great places to eat, lots of delicious choices. Emma was super helpful answering our questions about the area and the apartment. Would love to go back."
259722,452446107,2019-05-13T00:00:00.000Z,Marcelo's place is very adjacent to Kista park and very near to Galleria. The house is sparkling clean. Marcelo is very nice person and we had very nice discussions (whenever we had time). Will definitely stay at his place when I visit Kista again.
723539,23321223,2014-11-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Mathias came through on everything that he had specified in the description; clean, comfortable and accommodating apartment. A very seamless check in and the same for the exit. Warm when its cold out, quiet neighbors and it sits on a lovely street. While the weather didn't serve us any favors in terms of the balcony, I can imagine during the summer months you could be on the balcony all day. You are within striking distance to all Ostermalm and central Stockholm have to offer and only a few 100 yds from the Ostermalmstorg metro stop. Brasserie Godot on the corner serves a perfect Old Fashioned for cocktail enthusiast and while a bit pricey serves one of the finest pieces of steak I have had in Stockholm. Overall a great stay and a great location. Thanks for the pad Mathias, Cheers."
242188,14778749,2014-06-26T00:00:00.000Z,"I had a wonderful stay. Ms. Lidia was a very good host, her home was lovely and she was very kind and helpful. The location was perfect for walking or for catching the train. She made the trip easier and I would recommend her place for any one wanting a comfortable stay in Södermalm."

608672,52590848,2015-10-31T00:00:00.000Z,"This was a great place! Close to the action and the train station in Stockholm. Karl was very helpful when we got in even later at night. He showed us the apartment was cute, cozy, and warm. Karl even pulled out a map and recommended some things for us to do in Stockholm the next day. Great experience all around."
299154,53608681,2015-11-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Daniel hat uns in seiner Wohnung trotz unserer Verspätung erwartet und uns alle wesentliche kurz erklärt. Die Wohnung ist klein uns schnucklig und mit viel schwedischem Charme ausgestattet. Alles war sauber und angenehm, der Balkon ist auch im Herbst ein Pluspunkt. Für uns ein wunderbares Zuhause. Von der Wohnug aus ist in Stockholm alles bequem zu erreichen. Der Hauptbahnhof auch zu Fuss oder zwei Stationen mit der U-Bahn. Das Stadtviertel bietet alles was man zum Leben braucht. 
Absolut reizend. Wir kommen gerne wieder.
Danke dir Daniel für den freundlichen Kontakt und die Organisation."

Thanks Daniel"
1182616,13535924,2014-05-30T00:00:00.000Z,"We enjoyed staying at Peter's place in Stockholm.  It is very central and convenient to travel by Metro or bus around the city. It is in close walking distance of the lakefront. This is a shared living space although we only had another person in the space for one of three nights we were there. 

Peter was not able to meet us when we arrived and thus we missed having an orientation to the place and the community that would have been helpful."
1261445,11670479,2014-04-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Lovely flat, just as it looks in the pictures.  Perfectly clean, everything worked well.  It has a view over a park, so there's lots of light and greenery.  The bed is in a slightly separate room, so you don't feel like you're sleeping in the living room or eating in the bedroom!  There's a cute, small bathroom (apparently normal for the area) and a well equipped kitchen. 

Neighbourhood was perfect for my needs, with lots to do and see nearby and good transportation links to the rest of Stockholm.

Marie Louise was a helpful, charming and communicative host. Definitely recommend this place."
357012,490324945,2019-07-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Great Apartment! Perfect location in a quiet, yet central area with easy commute to the city.

1054406,528973835,2019-09-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Schöne grosse Unterkunft in den Aussenbezirken von Stockholm. T-Bahn Station in ca 20min zu Fuß oder mit dem Bus.
Hilfreiche Tipps vom netten Gastgeber sowie 2 Karten für die Bahn zum Aufladen.
Nette Aufmerksamkeit des Gastgebers, dass ein kleines \"Essenspaket\" (Brötchen, Gurke, Bier, etc.) bei der Anreise zur Verfügung gestellt wurde.

Empfehlenswert!"
954832,79833157,2016-06-14T00:00:00.000Z,"This was the perfect stay for us in Stockholm. The apartment is exactly as it presents on the AirBnB website which is so lovely to see. It is the cleanest apartment we have ever stayed in and there was not a thing out of place! Mikael was a lovely host who ensured we had everything we needed and even though he was out of town for the majority of time we were there he was easily contactable by email and phone which was a great reassurance. He was there to greet us when we arrived and discussed all the best places to visit and this welcome made settling in easy and made it feel like coming home. The only thing missing when there were eggs cups, but everything else about the kitchen was very simple to use and although it looks small there is in fact just the right amount of room to do everything you need. 

Thanks so much Mikael for providing an amazing home. We can't wait to return!"
900043,79881357,2016-06-14T00:00:00.000Z,"It was very easy to communicate with Annelie before and during my stay. The flat was clean and exactly as described.  It is a 1-2 minute walk from a Tunnelbana station, which was very convenient.  The neighborhood is safe and only a couple stops away from the heart of Södermalm. There are also plenty of bars and restaurants within a short walk.  

I did not cook, so I cannot comment on the kitchen.  

For guests visiting during the summer, you may want to bring an eye mask since the curtains are sheer and there is light through the window at all times.  Also, take special note the listing does not have wifi.   

I would stay here again!"

The location is 3 minutes' walk to Stockholms södra (commuter rail) station, 10 min walk to Mariatorget (metro) station, and ~15 min to Slussen and SoFo.

Карл очень тепло нас встретил, ответил на все вопросы и помог адаптироваться на новом месте , очень были тронуты  , что он нас  лично пришёл встречать на остановку. Спасибо и за историческую справку про остров на котором мы жили и конечно же за молоко :-) .
Я буду рекомендовать всем своим друзьям квартиру Карла , и если мы поедем ещё раз в Стокгольм , мы  знаем где  нас тепло встретят. Жить в таком тихом и уютном районе одно удовольствие.

As there we only 2 of us, we elected to sleep in the 2 bedrooms at either end of the apartment.  There was plenty of space for suitcases and other travel gear in the rooms.  The kitchen had every thing you could need.

El anfitrión bien, hasta el último día, que comunicándonos con el, entendimos que podíamos hacer el check out a las 11:00 (hablando con el a las 21:25, se lo comentamos, cdo nos pregunto la hora que íbamos a irnos. No nos respondió hasta las 8 am del día siguiente diciendo que 10:30, que no pudimos leer pk en la casa no hay wifi). Se presentó a las 10:15 en la casa, enfadadisimo,cuando fue un error de comunicación. Además, al final nos fuimos 10:30, nos lo encontramos en la calle y nos volvió a repetit que si no nos habíamos enterado de la hora del check out. Conclusión anfitrion desagradable por un error en la comunicación. La casa bien aunque falta tener wifi, mas si te comunica cn el anfitrión por whatsup"

916806,18051907,2014-08-21T00:00:00.000Z,"La estancia en casa de Mansour fue agridulce. El apartamento está muy bien equipado. Una tostadora le vendría muy bien. El apartamento es nuevo y muy luminoso con vistas desde la terraza a un lago. La comunicación con el centro de Estocolmo es fácil a través del metro. Hasta ahí todo bien, pero nos sentimos muy preocupados y molestos cuando injustamente se nos acusó de una cosa que no habíamos hecho, concretamente echar una gasa sanitaria en el inodoro. Leímos las instrucciones en el dossier y ponía que en sanitario se echará solamente el papel sucio. Encima del sanitario decía que no se echase ningún papel dentro. Solamente echamos varios papeles sucios el primer día. Nunca tela sanitaria, que no tenemos. Esta acusación injusta afectó especialmente a mi mujer que estuvo todo el tiempo preocupada e inquieta. Por lo demás, bien. El trato con Mansour, correcto."

Her place is conveniently located in the Sodermalm area which is around 10-15 minute walk to Gamla Stan and Central Station.  There are many great little cafes, restaurants, and hipster type of bars close to Cecelia's place.  With the windows open at night the place had a nice breeze therefore we were always comfortable and had some pleasant sleep.  Her place was equipped with all the extra amenities if you desire to cook.
We usually made breakfast and had dinner out since there's too many great restaurants to pass up on.  Stockholm is a great walking city and Cecilia's flat was greatly enjoyable.
The only recommendation is to squat while you shower since there's no shower curtain and the water will splatter everywhere making it rather messy and wet in the bathroom. Other than that it's a wonderful flat with the best possible location."

Aparte de eso, el resto fue bien, silencioso y sin problemas."

Roomy, comfortable, well-maintained, well-equipped, classic Stockholm apartment was a joy to spend time in, for not just the three of us, but for our family and friends who we entertained during our stay. Ideally located with restaurants, gym, stores and transportation nearby. Our hosts were not fussy at all, very agreeable and easy-going and made us feel warmly welcomed...all arrangements were made without complications...we would not hesitate to rent again if the opportunity arose and could not give a higher recommendation."

I would recommend this room to anyone who is seeking an affordable and centrally located option. If you like to walk - this location is just close enough to some of the major sites (about 20 min in multiple directions). Public transportation is also very close by (4 min walk)"

Cecilia's apartment was perfect: from the wonderful comfy bed to the fully equipped kitchen and sunlit lounge. Shopping was so easy with two supermarkets, a selection of wonderful cafes, laundromat and post office literally only steps away and an eclectic collection of small boutiques were equally close. Cecilia's instructions on how to find her apartment were so clear that I had no trouble at all. Her apartment was all that it is advertised and more."

Wir haben uns alle sehr wohl gefühlt und haben unseren Urlaub dort sehr genossen. Die Wohnung war sehr sauber und ordentlich, praktisch eingerichtet und voll ausgestattet. Es gibt nichts, was man vermissen würde. Die 1000 Kleinigkeiten (wie z.B. Gewürze), die eine Küche gut machen, sind alle vorhanden. 

Die Wohnung ist verkehrsgünstig gelegen, nicht weit von einer Pendelzugstation entfernt. Bei schönem Wetter sind wir auch ab und zu bis in die Altstadt gelaufen.

Im Hof gibt es einen großen Spielplatz, den die Kinder oft und gerne genutzt haben.

Der Kontakt mit Karin per Email und Telefon im Vorfeld und während des Aufenthaltes war sehr angenehm. Sie war immer sehr hilfsbereit und stand uns bei Fragen freundlich zur Seite und hatte auch gute Tipps für den Aufenthalt.

Wir haben die Zeit in Karins Wohnung sehr genossen - es war ein rundum schöner Urlaub, an den wir gern zurückdenken.

Vielen Dank dafür!"

It was very quiet and safe residential area that has convenient subway location and it connects all the important places!! 
Although it is not in the city center, if you have 1-day pass for subway, you will be satisfied with location. 
She prepared extra blow-up-airbed for us (we were 3 people) and everything was just perfect! very clean, neat and comfortable. Highly recommend!!"

313195,73834531,2016-05-10T00:00:00.000Z,"David was a great host! He was very responsive to all of our concerns and was very reliable. 

The place itself is very beautiful--there are two comfortable real beds and the small space in the home is very well utilized. There's great decor and it has so much character. It is very beautiful. The beds are comfortable and the washer has a dryer. The place is complete with all the basics that you need. The only tricky part is the stove, which wouldn't really stay on and we never figured out how to make it stay on. There's also amazing light that filters through the place, and a supermarket 2 minutes away. 

The location is a bit quieter and a 20 minute+ walk to some sights in Stockholm, but the neighborhood is safe and pretty. If you are with a large group, I recommend splitting an uber/taxi from wherever you are. Our party didn't mind the farther location because it was a wonderful place."
1182616,112703574,2016-11-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Peter's place is a very nice option if you don't mind sharing a bathroom with other guests (during our visit, there were three couples staying there). The kitchen is really nice, with all you need for making food, and there are two very good grocery stores just down the road. There's even an espresso coffee pot, which I especially appreciated! The Place is clean and the location could not be better for a Stockholm visit, with the airport bus stop just 50m from the front door and a Tunnelbana stop right there as well. We didn't meet Peter, but felt that he was right there to answer questions via email or SMS if you needed something. All in all, recommended for an easy-going, Airbnb-type stay."

1261445,35539125,2015-06-20T00:00:00.000Z,"I agree with all the great reviews of Mary-Louise's beautiful Södermalm apartment, which is perfect for two people. Very tiny bathroom by American standards, but the Stockholm shower actually works really well and is a space-saver. There is a stunning view of Högalids Kyrka and its surrounding park from the ceiling-high windows. A huge Hemköp grocery is just blocks away at the Hornstull \"mall\" with fresh, beautiful food. Lots of great shops (H&M Home!); juice bars, sushi, tapas, pizza and Lebanese restaurants and several great bars for people watching. One of the most beautiful 180° views of Stockholm is available by walking along Söder Mälarstrand, accessible within minutes from the apartment. If you're there in the summer be sure to look for the stretch of canal under and near the nearby bridges that contains dozens of mint-condition, vintage wooden speedboats. We had dinner at a terrific tapas place, Linje Tio at 24 Hornsbruksgatan."

Die Unterkunft liegt etwas außerhalb vom Stadtzentrum,was aber aufgrund der nur 2Min.entfernt gelegenen Metrostation kein Problem war.Innerhalb von 25Min ist man in der Altstadt Gamla Stan. Dean war ein freundlicher Gastgeber und holte uns sogar von der Metro ab und gab uns auf dem Weg zu sich ein paar Tipps,was man unternehmen könnte. Unser Zimmer war sauber und modern eingerichtet.Küche und Bad standen uns natürlich zur freien Benutzung.
Wir hatten einen angenehmen Aufenthalt bei Dean."
954832,24929391,2015-01-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Wir waren zu zweit über Silvester in Mikaels kleiner Wohnung. Die Wohnung war schön und sehr sauber; auch die Ausstattung war super (Kaffeemaschine, Föhn, Pürierstab, Regenschirme, Bügeleisen, Mikrowelle…). Das Bad war ziemlich neu und schick (Fußbodenheizung!). Die Lage der Wohnung ist auch gut; in einer halben Stunde erreicht man zu Fuß Stockholms Altstadt; Supermarkt, Bahn, Einkaufszentrum waren im 3min-Radius. Relativ leise und wirklich warm war die Wohnung auch. Die Sauna im Keller war groß und stand nach vorheriger Anmeldung uns allein zur Verfügung. 
Mikael ist ein absoluter Engel! Wir konnten ihn alles fragen und er hat uns immer geholfen. Er hat uns viele Broschüren über Stockholms Attraktionen zur Verfügung gestellt, im Voraus für uns einen Tisch im Restaurant reserviert und uns 8 Seiten Infos (Anfahrt zur Wohnung vom Flughafen, nähere Umgebung der Wohnung usw.) über Stockholm und die Wohnung per Mail geschickt - und das noch vor der Reise. Während unseres Aufenthaltes durften wir ihm immer eine kurze SMS schreiben, wenn wir Fragen hatten und er hat immer innerhalb von ein paar Minuten geantwortet. Mikael wohnt direkt nebenan und war so immer schnell zur Stelle. 
Es gab wirklich absolut nichts Negatives. Wir haben uns wirklich sehr wohl gefühlt - wie zuhause! Bei Reisen nach Stockholm wird es zukünftig immer in diese Wohnung gehen :)

1096827,81737724,2016-06-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Anita's flat was beautiful! She was not there when I arrived because we got the dates of my arrival mixed up, but this was no problem. She left the key with her lovely neighbor across the hall. She left out many helpful brochures and even bought some food for me to have in the fridge. Not only that, but her kindness was felt when she called me and gave me advice after I had lost my luggage (and got it back thankfully!) and gotten a migraine from lack of sleep and stress. 

The neighborhood is so cute and pretty, and is right next to the subway. It was easy to get around, a perfect location. I am in love with Stockholm, thank you Anita for hosting me and making this a memorable trip! I would definitely stay with you again."

Neighborhood is alive and you'll find a lot of places to stop for shopping or having fika. Daniel gave us nice explanations when we arrived and we didn't required his help during the three days. Really good !
757320,13655196,2014-06-02T00:00:00.000Z,Barb is very pleasant. the room is well situated (closed to underground and bus station)  and calm. We recommanded this adress.

Plus Marie Louise left us fruit and treats and fresh flowers in a vase to welcome us which was a very nice touch. I highly recommend it!"

1170766,37172839,2015-07-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Annika’s is the best place for the perfect journey in Stockholm

 We stayed in Annika’s appartment in Mariatorget for a week. The place is perfect. We enjoyed the space and brightness of it. Kitchen and bathroom are clean and really easy to use. We certainly enjoyed the balcony (breakfast under sunshine is always a delight) and the neighborhood. Lots of coffees, restaurants and shopping places. You can walk easily to the old city by the Monteliusvagen walk (a really peacefull walk and the best view upon the City). Even though the appartement is located in the city, the place is really calm. You can hear the seagulls sing every morning. Directly outside of the appartement you have supermarkets for food shopping and buses, the subway station to reach the center of the city in 10 minutes.

Really the best place to stay in Stockholm with a very welcoming guest… Annika’s place is the best !"

We could reach him easily and he was super helpful. The house has a lot of space, so for the 5 of us it was extremely comfy. We would definitely recommend this place and we would stay here again when we visit Stockholm!"

581243,16508458,2014-07-28T00:00:00.000Z,"I had a nice and relaxing weekend in Stockholm staying at Edwin's. Edwin was a very kind and pleasant host, welcoming, helpful, and quick to communicate with both before and during my stay. The apartment is superbly located - close to the city centre, with the shopping mall in the same building, and yet in a private and quiet area. The place was bright, clean, and comfortable. I spent quite a bit of time in the kitchen (yes, Edwin, the chicken!), but Edwin did not seem to mind. Eating a meal at the balcony in the afternoon sun was lovely. There is a reason why this place is usually booked out, so don't hesitate and send your request right away!"

Nice location, close to centre, with bars and restaurants nearby. Lotta is an excellent and welcoming host who keeps to herself but makes the stay very pleasant. Just be sure you're okay with the rules: no check-in after 10 pm, no showers after 10 pm (for noise reasons). If you're happy with those rules, it's an excellent choice, highly recommended!"

757320,194646503,2017-09-17T00:00:00.000Z,"The Brewery Conference Centre is around the corner from the apartment - 5 minute walk.  Perfect place to stay when attending conferences and then go on to walk around the city.  It's a Bohemian part of the city with great places to eat.  In front of the apartment is Falafelbaren, the side street on which the room faces has the Tehran Grill-great places to eat.  A great coffee house past the metro at Johan & Nystrom.  Lots of shops for groceries and 2 mins from the metro.  Though I hardly used it.  You can walk everywhere.  Even though situated on a busy road, I slept peacefully on all nights. Comfortable room and facilities. A good price in Stockholm in an ideal location."

The bed is amazing, it works wonders after a long day of going around Stockholm. The neighbourhood is very quiet and feels safe late in the evening. Public transport is as described, you get from your doorstep to city centre in like 20-30 mins. Overall, I can surely recommend it."
581243,190424824,2017-09-04T00:00:00.000Z,Edwin was a great host. The house is beautiful with all the amenities and is extremely central. The train station is right below the house making it very convenient to commute. Highly recommend this apartment.

There is a lot of shopping, restaurants, and bars all with in walking distance. Hopping onto the bus or metro was just a short walk, very convenient. The loft was great and had everything we needed. Annika provided coffee so it was nice being able to wake up and make a pot. We were able to ask Annika anything throughout our time there whether in person or through email (which she promptly replied). This was such a great experience. When I'm back in Stockholm, I hope I can stay here again!"
1153177,192225466,2017-09-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Spacious, clean and well-stocked kitchen.  A few extra food items he provided was handy."

1182616,5813112,2013-07-17T00:00:00.000Z,"We totally loved the place! First, it was a great location - just a couple stations from the Old City by direct line, a 2 minute walk from the metro station, a lot of shops around the place. We loved Mini Prix shop where we bought wonderful salads from salad bars (with shrimps, etc.) for dinner for a very good price when we didn't eat out. Second, the place was clean and VERY quiet - that was really important for us. Third, the host (Peter) was extremely friendly and nice! He couldn't meet us on the date we arrived so his absolutely lovely friends met us. Forth, the room itself was very good - big, light (we had a lovely balcony), with a big wardrobe with a lot of space for our things, the bed had two lamps on the sides - so each of us could read. Fifth, the also loved the kitchen - big and light, we always cooked our breakfast there. 

I would definitely recommend the place!"
620848,5731852,2013-07-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Hannas flate was a very nice and quiet place to stay! It was very close to the Stockholmsmässan congress center  that we attended (5 minutes walk). The hosts Hanna & Keith answered all our questions via email and short messages within one day or few hours. In addition, they provided some cheese & thinks for the first breakfast which was really nice because we arrived at Sunday evening. Thank you both for the nice time in Stockholm! The air-condition was not perfect for us but it was ok after a while."
916806,475525639,2019-06-24T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment is perfect for people traveling by car and/or enjoying a break in a calm surrounding after a trip to Stockholm city. You can reach the city by underground train within about half an hour with a short stroll to the next station. At the station there is a shopping mall with supermarkets and several shops.
The apartment is one large room plus bathroom. The large bed is situated in a nook so it almost gives the impression of a separate room. The kitchen is well equipped so you can cook your own meal if you like.
Taller people have to pay attention because a beam between the kitchen part and the living room is quite low. 
Although on ground level the apartment is quite bright. It has a huge deck with a small table and chairs where  - in summertime- you can enjoy your „fika“."
916806,33761804,2015-06-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Mansour was the perfect host. Thankyou for being so accommodating and informative. Cannot be faulted.

Die Umgebung ist sehr ruhig und grün, die 2 Terrassen am Haus sind der Hit! In der Nähe hat es auch ein Schulhaus mit grossem Spielplatz, das war perfekt für unsere 2 Kinder (7 + 8 Jahre). Nach Stockholm kann man bequem mit der Metro fahren. Der Kontakt zu Arne war sehr gut (via SMS/Mail), die Schlüsselübergabe funktionierte bestens. Wir fühlten uns sehr willkommen, vielen Dank!!!"
302496,80826782,2016-06-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Seta was the most considerate and hospitable host!

If there´s a downside it´s that bathroom is not new (although it´s clean) and there could be more cooking appliances available (although I got by perfectly with what was available), however that didn´t bother me too much. The bed was comfy, it was quiet at night, plenty of hot water, and fast internet access. Highly recommended."

974175,49950216,2015-10-07T00:00:00.000Z,Sofie a réagi au quart de tour et nous a enlevé une belle épine du pied. Son appartement est très confortable et décoré avec goût. Sofie manifestement aime cuisiner et s'est offert une cuisine digne d'un restaurant 3 étoiles! La station de métro est à deux pas et dessert la gare Centrale en deux minutes.
299154,106650701,2016-10-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Great place to stay! The location was excellent!! Close to many restaurants, cafes, supermarkets and shopping.

It was spotlessly clean and she had stocked up the fridge and pantry for our convenience. Her communication is also excellent, always replying quickly. We were sad to leave our cute little apartment, we wanted to stay longer! Stockholm is wonderful and the public transport system is co close and user friendly. HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
164448,8663866,2013-11-11T00:00:00.000Z,"I stayed at Lidia's with my boyfriend this weekend and we had a great time. The flat is in a very good location - walking distance from the trendy SoFo and from Gamla Stan and also very close to Sodra station which is one stop from Central Station (on the commute train). The room was quite basic but perfectly nice with a proper bed (very comfy!) and there is a sitting area outside with a fridge, microwave and kettle. Lidia was very kind and helpful with all sorts of maps and tourist guides for us to borrow and loads of advice. Overall I would definitely recommend this as good value for money and a great experience"
608672,48176330,2015-09-24T00:00:00.000Z,Karl's apartment was good for a solo traveler. The location was close to public transit and nearby to several restaurants.   Both he and his wife were responsive and communicative and made sure that we connected prior to my arrival.
581243,426183378,2019-03-20T00:00:00.000Z,Really a nice place to be that is not far away from all the tourist attractions (we walked everywhere in about 20 min). Edwin was really nice and helped us a lot with the organization of our departure which was very early in the morning.
916806,184721051,2017-08-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Julia's place is perfect if you want a great value outside of Stockholm central!  The apartment would be a bit cramped for 4 people but as I was staying here as a solo traveller, I found the apartment perfect for my needs.  The apartment comes nicely furnished and has everything you need to cook for yourself, wash your clothes, and entertain guests.  The bed is comfortable.  The bathroom small but adequate.  The location isn't the greatest but it is accurate in the listing description a 10-15 minute walk uphill from the Skarholmen T-bana station plus a  25 minute ride into central station.  I really appreciated the clear check-in instructions and general level of care that Julia took to ensure a pleasant stay.  Would stay again.

(A small note about the \"panaromic view\":  Yes there is a nice view from the edge of the deck outside, but it is not visible from inside the apartment or the apartment windows.)"
608672,350776694,2018-11-20T00:00:00.000Z,The landlords were so kind that they waited for me as late as 0.30 to check in. The small flat was very cosy and well-located in a historical building in central Stockholm. The only minus is the shower. Installation of proper shower facilities will add much more value to the accommodation.
624886,279940673,2018-06-22T00:00:00.000Z,This was our second visit to Oskar’s apartment and it did not disappoint.  Stylishly appointed and located in a great area.
242188,131209994,2017-02-11T00:00:00.000Z,"I have great time in Lidia's home. She is very helpful and kind lady. She always tries to help you, if you need anything. Her home is big and comfortable. She always tried to make myself at home. Also it was really nice to talk with her. She is very friendly. Her home has great location, lots of good cafes in there and also close to city center.I recommend this to everyone who is visiting the beautiful city, Stockholm."

She is generous in helping international travelers acculturate to a Swedish living environment, making the flat truly feel like home for a few days."
1158893,24807367,2015-01-03T00:00:00.000Z,"The House looked exactly like on the pictures. Everything was nicely arranged!

916806,505357249,2019-08-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Nous recommandons sans hésiter. A 10 min à pied de la gare qui permet ensuite de rejoindre le centre de Stockholm en 20 minutes maximum. Nous avons apprécié notre séjour dans ce logement bien équipé, propre et bénéficiant d'une grande terrasse au calme. Centres commerciaux à proximité"
974175,290802291,2018-07-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Beatifully decorated, but still cozy and personal apartment in a quiet neighborhood. Excellent connections and also able to walk to the city center. Very nice running in Haga park or even around Brunnviken if you fancy a longer run.

Very easy to communicate with Sofie and Jesper (very quick answers!). Sofie and Jesper were great hosts! Everything worked perfectly. Warmly recommended!!"

She was a very attencious host, providing everything we needed.
We valued our chats with her during breakfast as she told us stories and guidance to better understand what we saw in Stockholm.
We strongly recommend Lidia´s place."
581243,169596300,2017-07-13T00:00:00.000Z,Edwin is a really nice and uncomplicated guy. Very clean and comfortable! Can only recommend!
543045,74424501,2016-05-15T00:00:00.000Z,"It is a little apartment very well located and very clean. We were 4 people and we just slept in the apartment, we didn't live the apartment"
1212891,101524708,2016-09-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Wir hatten eine fantastische Zeit in Stockholm! Maud ist sehr freundlich, aufgeschlossen, interessiert und zuvorkommend. Wir haben uns bei ihr immer sehr willkommen gefühlt. Auch die Lage der Wohnung ist super. Von dort aus ist man in wenigen Minuten am Wasser und auch die Metrostation ist schnell zu erreichen. Wir können sowohl Wohnung als auch Gastgeberin nur wärmstens empfehlen!"
647314,103946971,2016-09-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Amazing room, big size, comfortable bed. Really easy to find, easy to access (door code and key in a lock), very close to the tube, nice neighbourhood for shopping, going out, drinks, etc. Very handy to old town, even walking. I would love going back! Thanks Mallika."
581243,19262825,2014-09-09T00:00:00.000Z,"In my experience Edwin is the best Airbnb host. He provided us with detailed information, responded quickly and very accommodating. The place is very easy to find, opposite the station. We arrived very late at night and we found the place easily by following his information. The room/bathroom/apartment were super clean. The area is also nice, within a walking distance from museums, there's a mall with supermarket in the basement of the apartment building and there are restaurants nearby."
1261445,21004587,2014-10-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Marie-Louise was very quick with responses, gave feedback on how best get to her apartment from the the Hornstull bus station, which was close by, and extremely accommodating. Her and her daughter were very hospitable in welcoming us to their apartment, showing us where everything was at and the \"how-tos\" of the bathroom (Stockholm shower, not an issue though, easy to use) and greeting us with snacks to share, which was extra thoughtful. The apartment itself was exactly as advertised, very clean, organized and cozy. It was a beautiful home to stay in and the area was very nice too, good restaurants not far from it, and the metro is a block away. Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay while in Stockholm."
302496,469339312,2019-06-14T00:00:00.000Z,"This is a very comfortable and lovely home. The kitchen is complete and well designed. The high ceilings, spacious rooms, many windows and artistic decor made it feel special. It’s convenient to central Stockholm with buses and metro so close. Tip: if you’re a light sleeper bring ear plugs to shut out traffic noises. I did and was perfectly comfortable and slept well."
608672,468675404,2019-06-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Great, clean flat in a central location. It had everything I needed and it was very quiet. The bathroom floor does get pretty wet when you shower but i didn’t mind. Highly recommended!"
1271843,36986749,2015-07-03T00:00:00.000Z,"We really enjoyed our short stay in Andre's and Johanna's apartment. They were warm and welcoming, with good suggestions for things to do and see in Stockholm. The apartment is lovely and comfortable.  It was conveniently close to the metro and within walking distance to Gamla Stan. We especially enjoyed the breakfast foods they provided.  We enjoyed our conversations and hope to see them again."
610034,6657304,2013-08-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Beautiful flat, The pictures doesn't' lie  . We found everything in perfect conditions.
The location is great if you want to be in Sodermalm  (that was my case)

The only thing to improve : the mattress is not broad enought  a couple ... not impossible , but surely not comfortable. 

Nico"
608672,166274871,2017-07-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Amazing location! Very close to the main street to shops and restaurants yet also very quiet. The unit is a pleasant size for solo traveling. Overall, great value!"
755843,463844415,2019-06-04T00:00:00.000Z,"One of the best houses I've stayed at.
Par is very kind and his home is so beautiful, cozy and clean. The position is perfect to visit the city: there's a bus stop (center direction) near the palace and metro station 5minute by walk. I definitely recommend this house as a solution in Stockholm! Me and my family are very satisfied, 5 stars!"
647314,26328918,2015-02-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Mallika was a wonderful host and one of the most beautiful persons I have met during my AirBnB travels :) Ramses, her cat was really adorable as well... His purring just make you want to stay in whole day with him.

954832,7343938,2013-09-16T00:00:00.000Z,"The only thing I can say about this apartment and my experience is that it was wonderful! The place itself is fantastic, very modern, clean and fully equipped with everything you could possibly need. Perfect for two people, but also in three there shouldn't be any problem. We went everywhere by foot, a nice walk of about 10min to get to the centre of the city or 5min to the beautiful park with a small beach. Mikael and his wife are very gracious and wonderful people, they are helpful if you need something and are always available if you would like any suggestions in town. I strongly recommend to anyone who plans on visiting Stockholm to stop their search for a place to stay and book with these guys :)!"
581243,288671478,2018-07-10T00:00:00.000Z,"The host is very helpful and willing to help people. He can give you many good suggestions and save you much time.

Melissa left us some food for the first breakfast and tips regarding sighseeing and transportation. The apartment is in good location, close to two subway stations and around 15 minutes to city center. Despite, we didn't meet Melissa in person, she is really helpfull, nice and flexible towards arrival and departure time. I can absolutely recommend to stay there."

The apartment itself is a stones throw from the center but on a quiet side street. Very clean and cozy with a small kitchenette... Would definitely like to stay again if I return.
757320,22610084,2014-11-10T00:00:00.000Z,"We loved Stockholm and staying with Barb was great. Her apartment is in a fantastic location and getting to her place was very easy as she gave comprehensive instructions. 

The room itself is large, warm and comfortable. We had access to the lounge and kitchen but spent all our time out so didn't utilise these facilities. Barb made us breakfast on our last morning and had interesting stories to tell. We also loved her daughter's dog Dolly."
608672,82091096,2016-06-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Karl's instructions for getting to the house were perfect and having multiple options to choose from was nice so we didn't have to depend on one option.

Karl was available upon arrival for a walkthrough of the flat to get us acclimated, even though we arrived late in the evening. 

The flat was clean, comfortable, quiet and in a nice neighbourhood within walking distance to most anything in the city. Would definitely stay here again on another trip to Stockholm!"

Une galerie commerciale se situe en dessous de l’immeuble, très pratique car elle dispose de deux grands supermarchés pour faire les courses. 

L’appartement était d’une propreté remarquable et très appréciable ! La chambre était bien  agencée, la salle de bain très propre,  et la cuisine très fonctionnelle et agréable. 

Edwin fut discret et très gentil  durant notre séjour, nous permettant aussi de se sentir à l’aise. Nous reviendrons sans hésiter chez Lui !"

The check-in and checking-out was flexible and smooth. His friend let me in and showed around the place. It is a cosy and clean apartment that has everything you could possibly need. On top of everything I was allowed to used Martin's bike, which was very convenient to get to the university. Apart from that, the place is just a minute from the metro station, and actually in a walking distance from the centre if you don't mind 15 min walks.
