At bo i en lejlighed er perfekt når man rejser med mindre børn, og der var legetøj osv. klar til dem hvilket var et stort hit!Christian var den perfekte vært, trods han har ikke var fysisk tilstede, var han meget opmærksom på vores ankomst og ophold via mail. Og det fungerede upåklageligt at hente og aflevere nøglen i 7eleven!
De bedst anbefalinger herfra.. hvis vi skal til Stockholm en anden gang, vil vi gerne bo her igen!"

Edwin is a great host. 
So, five stars!"
915013,467916588,2019-06-11T00:00:00.000Z,A nice apartment between the students in Gärdet and fancy fancy Östermalm :) The cafe at the top of the road is great!
164448,293324526,2018-07-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Li was such a great host! Her place has a great location,  comfortable bed and she was so helpful!"
819676,242027387,2018-03-11T00:00:00.000Z,Everything went very fine at Andy & Vannie's. The apartment's situation is like perfect: very easy to get anywhere by walking or using public transportation. The apartment itself was clean and calm and it's very convenient to have your own bathroom during the stay. Both the room and the bathroom are at the entrance of the apartment so that you feel very independant during your stay. I would also add that both check-in & check-out were convenient as Andy & Vannie let me arrive and leave whenever it suited me best. Thanks!
916806,122242618,2016-12-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Het appartement ligt op de rand van een buitenwijk met mooi uitzicht. Het is niet groot maar schoon, compleet en perfect voor 2 personen. 15 minuten lopen naar de winkels en een goed Metronetwerk en dus prima. De 3 dagenkaart is een voordelige manier om rond te reizen door Stockholm en alle eilandjes te ontdekken. Om die redenen een goed adres!"
776012,90239377,2016-07-31T00:00:00.000Z,"We had an incredible stay here.  The apartment is literally steps away from Gamla Stan's main square, and could not be in a better location.  The house is spacious for the area (with a large living space and separate bedroom) and the hosts were great.  We could not have had a better stay."
647314,14767636,2014-06-26T00:00:00.000Z,"This may have been our most negative experience on AirBNB since I started using the service 4 years ago. Communication was extremely painful, the host was not accommodating and the burden of everything was generally on us.

She wanted precise hours of arrival and leaving – quite hard to do when you’ve only been to a city once. She had a complicated system of handing keys over, to the point that she expected us to learn it in person. Her listing describes a clean-up process that includes mopping floors, cleaning the (shared) bathroom and fridge, among others (she later clarified that was only for when she's out of town, but that's not what's on record), and a clean-up fee is not included.

Cancellation policy is strict. When we requested an emergency change, due in part to our mistake (misinformation about Midsummer schedules), she was unhelpful and irritable, accusing us of trying to do things outside AirBNB, to the point that we gave in and just paid for the unused night. Our last minute cancellation was directly linked to this type of behavior.

If you want a relaxed trip with no drama, please find another listing."

1158893,178664414,2017-08-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Es war einfach toll. Angefangen von all den Informationen im Vorfeld über Sehenswürdigeiten, Tips über Restaurants und Orte die man aufuchen sollte über die perfekte Dokumentation, um zum Haus zu finden. Selbst als wir da waren wurde gefragt on alles in Ordnung sei oder ob man noch etwas brauche. Das Haus hat sofort zum Wohlfühlen eingeladen und jeder, immerhin fünf erwachsene Kinder und die Eltern, hat seinen Platz gefunden zum relaxen oder zum Plaudern. Einfach herrlich. Dass das Haus sauber und gepflegt war erklärt sich von selbst. Fazit: Toller Platz, um mit einer Familie einen winderschönen Urlaub zu verbringen und tolle Gastgeber."
1204621,531724888,2019-09-18T00:00:00.000Z,I book it for my mother and Nettan is nice person. My mom was happy and  very satisfied with accommodation. I'm recommend this. Thank you Nettan.
299154,427811359,2019-03-24T00:00:00.000Z,Apparemment très bien situé juste à côté d'une station principale du métro. Très petit mais ça suffit. Daniel est très réactif pour répondre aux messages et nous a attendu alors qu'on avait une heure de retard.
299154,5469144,2013-07-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice place in a great location. Lots of restaurants, bars and shops just around the corner. Daniel is an excellent host, supernice and very accommodating. Would certainly stay at his place again. Thanks for hosting us, Daniel!"
1124388,28177141,2015-03-19T00:00:00.000Z,"My friend and I had a great time staying at Carl's place. It was adorable and comfortable with lots of personal touches. We were very pleased to listen to some of his records! Also, Carl was an incredibly helpful host and great at communicating. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to visit Stockholm."
274876,84811991,2016-07-09T00:00:00.000Z,Our stay was excellent. The apartment was comfortable and easy and Emma was supportive and helpful. We would definitely stay here again if we come back to Stockholm.
954832,457104821,2019-05-23T00:00:00.000Z,This was a great home base while we spent a couple days exploring Stockholm. It’s close to grocery and transit. The apartment was very clean. I really appreciated that! We had all the basics. A simple stove and all basics to make some simple dishes for during the times we didn’t eat out at a local restaurant. Having two beds made it more comfortable. Mikael was quick to respond to any questions.
1204621,20295060,2014-09-27T00:00:00.000Z,"I stayed in this room approximately 2 weeks when attending a course in KTH and liked it very much. The room as well as the whole apartment are beautiful and well-appointed with a good kitchen and a nice view to the ferry harbour. The location is excellent as the Gärdet metrostation is near, in the neighbouring area there are also grocery shops and lots of parks and other green areas. The host was welcoming, nice and friendly and always ready to help."
763407,22524549,2014-11-09T00:00:00.000Z,"A great experience and a warm hospitality. Gabriella is a perfect host. The apartment is a small gem, located in a perfect position, a quiet area at walking distance from the city center. Very elegant, we will definitively recommend it. Grazie Gabriella."

283446,89784794,2016-07-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Vidha and her family were the perfect hosts, they helped me feel at home in Stockholm, the food they cooked was great and the apartment was spacious, clean, and conveniently located. They even packed me a lunch for my train trip down to Germany. Would highly recommend!"
700113,51727415,2015-10-24T00:00:00.000Z,I had a very nice ~1-month visit to Stockholm and thoroughly appreciated staying in this small apartment. I would consider staying there again. It is within walking distance of the university and many restaurants. The host is also very nice.
819676,140685335,2017-03-31T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed for 2 nights here and really enjoyed our stay! Andy was warm, welcoming, and very nice to talk to. Communication was excellent, he always responded to any questions right away. This AirBnB is in an excellent location and very central. Andy allowed us to drop our bags early and made everything so easy. The room is cozy, the penthouse overall is a very clean and beautiful space. Highly recommend and would stay again if we are in Stockholm."
313195,36332330,2015-06-27T00:00:00.000Z,"David was a great host, always looking to help and provide us with all that we needed.

It's really easy to access the center of the city from the flat either via bus, metro or even walking.

Overall, we had a great experience in Stockholm and David helped it to happen.

So thanks to him and good luck to him and his future guests.

Anis"
536283,6308313,2013-08-07T00:00:00.000Z,We spent an enjoyable few days in beautiful Stockholm. Paolo's apartment was the perfect base of operations for our exploration of Södermalm's many great cafes and restaurants.
1231897,95302780,2016-08-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Staying with Alex was our first airbnb experience - it was awesome! Alex had some good tips for us about what to see and how to get around and was a really great host. The room was very nice too, very comfy bed! Thanks a lot, Alex! :)"
1182616,150198125,2017-05-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Peter's appartment is nicely situated in Stockholm, about 10 minutes walking from the city center. The appartment is not very new but fine. The bed is comfortable and the balcony is surely wonderful in summer. However, we were surprised to find six other people were staying in the two other rooms in the three-room appartment. This meant that we had to wait for about an hour to shower each morning. This situation could have been made more clear in the advertisement. The appartment feels more like a hostel. Additionally, if you are a light sleeper, then watch out because the walls are quite thin and with so many people there is some noise. Concluding, it is an okay appartment in a good location but with too many guests."
1228583,343913595,2018-11-02T00:00:00.000Z,Great apartment for our stay in Stockholm. The location is convenient to the metro and bus plus Linda gave some great recommendations and local tips.
1182616,84045952,2016-07-05T00:00:00.000Z,Communication with Peter worked well although we were not able to meet him personally. The apartment is located very close to the city hall and Gamla stan.
624886,285608802,2018-07-04T00:00:00.000Z,Très bel appartement. Hôte très accueillant. Nous avons beaucoup apprécié notre séjour.

608672,154737474,2017-05-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Great place in the Norrmalm downtown area.  Clean, easy to find, and cozy!  I loved the little park a block away"
1303522,44538098,2015-08-27T00:00:00.000Z,"We were really confortable during our stay. Fantastic communication with public transport. The apartment included everything that we needed. Camila was a nice amphitryon! The next time that we traveled to stockholm, we will go back at the same apartment."
299154,216210863,2017-12-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Appartement idéalement situé tout est accessible à pieds , quartier branché.Daniel est très sympa et de très bon conseils ,patient pour les explications dû à la différence de langue. Il parle très bien anglais."
608672,366801322,2019-01-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Une chambre idéalement située pour visiter Stockholm. Le métro, la gare et les commerces sont à proximité. Les lieux d’intérêts à 15/20min à pied. Les seuls problèmes sont la douche !!! Du jamais vu en 30 ans de voyage dans le monde et la cuisine qui n’en est pas une. Il y a juste un micro-onde, un frigo et un peu de vaisselle. C’est dommage car l’immeuble est très calme et vraiment bien situé !!"
302496,1903707,2012-08-06T00:00:00.000Z,Seta is a wonderful and enthusiastic person. Her apartment is a wonderful top apartment. I'm sad that I had to leave! I hope to be back!
1048668,186302977,2017-08-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Melissa's charming apartment is great! We had a wonderful stay in this special and tasteful place during our visit to Stockholm. Melissa gave us tips for nice Cafes and Restaurant in the local neighborhood and the city center is easily reached by subway. Melissa left us coffee, bread and marmalade for breakfast. Even though we didn't meet her the communication was good and she answered our questions immediately. If you are into movies, arts and cactuses - this is a place for you :-)"
845365,36541542,2015-06-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Michael was a very hospitable host. He was friendly and welcoming and gave us great tips on the hot spots in Sweden. The room itself was cosy and the location of the apartment is in close proximity to the metro. All-in-all, a great experience! Thanks Michael :)"
916806,340298305,2018-10-23T00:00:00.000Z,bon rapport qualité prix. ligne de métro directe au centre ville. Près d'un parc calme et bord de mer. sympa.
608672,34397327,2015-06-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Our host, Karl, was very helpful, giving us lots of information before we arrived and in getting us settled in when we did arrive, and the apartment was just as pictured. The neighborhood was lovely and right near many shops and restaurants; a two block walk led to a beautiful park with fountains and statue of Strindberg. As many reviewers have noted, the shower arrangement in the bathroom is a bit weird, but workable if you don't mind squeegeeing the floor after your shower. I found the very soft, thin mattress very uncomfortable because it offered no back support, but my husband slept just fine. There was instant coffee and tea in the kitchenette, but with terrific cafes so near, we didn't use either. There was a hairdryer provided too, but there was no place to plug it in in the bathroom (and the mirror in there was too high for me to see myself anyway); it could have been plugged in the kitchen, but that had no mirror either. So I ended up drying my hair at the desk in the picture, using the mirror that was about 16 feet away - not a good setup. I'd recommend this accommodation for someone with a good back who doesn't have to use a mirror much."
1204621,277294186,2018-06-16T00:00:00.000Z,Asuin Nettanin luona yhtäjaksoisesti yhteensä kuukauden päivät. Viihdyin erinomaisesti! Yhteisasuminen oli helppoa ja vaivatonta. Pidin asunnosta ja sen sijainnista meren ja ulkoilualueiden lähellä. Alue oli rauhallista ja liikenneyhteydet keskustaan olivat erinomaiset. Sain aina apua kun tarvitsin neuvoa Tukholmassa liikkumiseen tai ideoita kivoista vierailukohteista.
700113,485226092,2019-07-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Very friendly host, balcony with a beautiful view in a nice area."
1251466,54174705,2015-11-16T00:00:00.000Z,We (three girls) have enjoyed our stay at Deans place. He haven`t met Dean but his wife was very kind and cooked tea for us when we arrived. I can recommend them :)
448259,9181377,2013-12-11T00:00:00.000Z,I've stayed 1 month in this room. It was very nice and very clean. A bit far away from the city center but it's ok.
700113,402675731,2019-01-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Great place! The location was brilliant, I walked into the centre and didn’t bother getting a travel card my first couple of days. There are lots of nice cafes and restaurants nearby. Supermarket just a few minutes away. Easy to get to Arlanda as the station is only 10 minutes away. The apartment itself is warm, cosy & comfortable with really good amenities. Having a kettle was definitely a bonus! The host is very friendly & kind. I would definitely stay there again."
299154,7881665,2013-10-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Clean versatile apartment on the 3rd floor. Small kitchen, queen bed, and L sofa. Large flatscreen TV. Balcony. Two minute walk to train station, and in good area of Sodermalm, close to Gamla Stan."

206221,13478154,2014-05-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Elisabeth has been an ideal host for my parents who really appreciated their stay from the first to the last minute at her place. She is a very friendly person who also happens to be very available and provide good tourism advises. 
The location of her accommodation is hardly beatable since it is very close from the center in a very cozy district.
I definitely recommend it!"
1182616,60906949,2016-01-29T00:00:00.000Z,We feel really comfortable in Peter's house.Although the weather has been bad in those days so that we did not enjoy the nice sunny balcony.We are still very happy and the location is really great.Peter is very nice and kind as well.

It was a nice neighbourhood, a nice appartment to stay at!"

Wonderful space, full of many \"extras\" like umbrella, shopping bag, laundry soap etc. Mikael was the perfect blend of communication and privacy. The room was perfect, small, clean and exactly what we needed. The little kitchen had everything we needed to make some meals at \"home\". Great location for the subway and grocery shopping. A wonderful stay."

985944,495705992,2019-07-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Anna's apartment is basically my dream European apartment: stylish, high ceilings, perfect location, big and well designed. There was so much space that we never knew if we should hang out in the beautiful kitchen or the cozy living room. The beds were super comfy, nice bathroom too. It's a 2-3 minute walk to the nearest bus and metro stop. You could even walk to the Gamla Stan (old town) if you wanted (20-30 minutes). The apartment is located near good restaurants, pubs and cute boutiques. Anna responds quickly to every question you may have. She left us an instructional booklet for the apartment that also included recommendations for shopping/restaurants/tours. She even found us a high chair for our baby! Anna is an amazing super host with a beautiful apartment. Definitely one of my top Airbnb experiences. Thanks again Anna!"

From the initial inquiry to stay in this gorgeous apartment to the moment we closed the door and dropped the keys through the mail slot. The apartment is stunningly beautiful and comfortable. The location is great, near public transportation, restaurants and cafes but also very quiet.  The host set the gold standard for hospitality - responsive, genuine, friendly and helpful.
If you have an opportunity to stay here do it, you will love it."

The location was good. Just 10-15min away from city center in Bus (Day and Night).
The host was particularly welcoming with good food waiting for us. Thanks again Carl for the apartment. I will definitely recommend this flat for a weekend."
1149820,14826904,2014-06-27T00:00:00.000Z,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Klara's studio for three weekday nights. We spent most of the day exploring Stockholm, so this small space met all of our needs (bed, shower and kitchen for cooking breakfast). The apartment building and surrounding area are calm, and we felt super safe the whole time. Plus, I really loved the clean and minimalist design of the studio. 

The location was quite convenient, too. In less than five minutes, you can walk to the nearest metro stop, which is easy to navigate. Also, Klara let us use her bike rental cards, which was another fun way to see the city. There's actually a bike stand closer to the apartment than the metro. 

Klara was a thoughtful host. She emailed us a document with additional information about the apartment as well as recommendations for cafes, restaurants and grocery stores. (There's a good one right by the metro.) 

If you don't require too much square footage (especially in the bathroom where the entire space basically becomes the shower), then this studio is cozy for a couple and fantastic for a solo traveler. 

Tack, Klara!"

While his apartment may not have been a five star hotel, it was close to public transit and in a nice area of town. There was a grocery store near by so we were able to do all make all of our own dinners which saved us a lot of money. He was also very friendly and gave us tips on what it's like to be an AirBNB host. Overall we had a great time while visiting Stockholm and found Jarl's home a nice place to spend our evenings."

Después de mostrarnos el apartamento nos enseñó el vecindario, indicándonos donde comprar o comer y nos dio consejos útiles para visitar la ciudad. ¿Que más se puede pedir?"

The location is great...not far from Gamla Stan and 2 blocks from the Radsmangatan metro station. Karl even provided tea bags and instant coffee that I prepared in the little kitchenette. I didn't have a computer, and Karl let me check my email on his next door. The only drawback is the shower, which is almost on top of the toilet. He has a splashboard that doesn't work and the bathroom became a wading pool every time I showered. It was easy enough, though, to mop up with squeegee and dry rags provided. I would highly recommend staying here."

She was kind and welcomed us when we arrived. The room was not huge but spacious enough for two older individuals to move with ease. My parents said they enjoyed the room and the amenities included. The only concern that my parents felt was that her room does not have black-out curtains. So going to sleep early or waking up late was complicated by the northern sun hours. Overall, amazing place."

We had an amazing time in Stockholm! Your house was wonderful and cozy but you as a personal guide was truly fantastic!!

All the things we did, like exploring the city and visiting an IceHockey game, was in reach of your house. 

So we want to thank you again for having us. Maybe we will meet again anywhere in the future.

Greetings,

608672,77776048,2016-06-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Lovely little flat in an excellent location in Stockholm. Really close to the Rådmasgatan T station on the green line as well as several supermarkets, pubs, coffee shops, and restaurants. Karl was welcoming and kind. There were only two minor inconveniences (which were not a big deal and I guess I wasn't paying great attention to the pictures): one was that the little kitchenette had no sink and the second was that the shower is constructed without a floor that slopes down to the drain, so you have to use a window scraper to get the water off of the floor and into the drain (the curtain doesn't really stretch, so it doesn't give much coverage). I only stayed 2 nights, so these factors were not a huge inconvenience. The other thing is that I wish I had been notified that there would be construction going on in the building (the hammering on the landing started at around 7:30 am each morning). Again, not a deal breaker, just wish I had been able to take into consideration when choosing where to stay. 

Overall, comfortable bed, lovely location, but with a few inconveniences and slow wifi."

The Host - Satya is a great host with relaxed vibe, always helpful and provide good information without being too intrusive.
The Place - The room is large, white-washed, and well furnished with plenty of open space. We have a share of clean bathroom (good water flow / warm) and kitchen. The room also come with good wifi connection. And of course, you will notice plenty of \"happy man\" right from the front door of Satya's flat.
The Location - located 5 minutes walk from S:t Eriksplan T-Bana station, 4-5 stops from all major tourist attactions.
Nearby - Try Mellqvist Caffe for one of the best breakfast experience around - they do great breakfast set. Also try Xoko restaurant with innovative cakes and sandwiches, all within less than 5 minutes from the accommodation.

The location was great, lots of cafes and boutiques in the area; it was only a short bus (#2) into the city or a 45 minute walk. 

Emma was a wonderful host even going to the trouble of buying a breakfast foods, milk and juice for our stay before she left.

She was available to answer any questions and we can't think of anything that was missing.

The USB for internet works pretty good but wifi would make this airbnb even better. Not really a problem though since there's plenty free wifi almost everywhere in Stockholm. If you're going to use the couch as second bed be wary that you can't really blind the window in the livingroom.
Overall Mathias' place is great for a weekend or a week in Stockholm. Almost everything you might wanna visit is in walking distance. Mathias is a nice and flexible host and his apartment was great."

The appartment is the great sample of tastiness and thought-out functionality, we liked each and every part of it. We were also particularly impressed by Maria's gesture to store some breakfast items for us! Thanks! 
For future guests we would recommend to aquire Stockholm card - convenient way to save money without comprimising on your touristic plans to visit very many places of interests.

The only thing, but very important, is the level of cleaning. If you put as a rule that you have to take off your shoes you must clean the floor, if not this rule have no sense. The same thing with the bathroom. If you want to rent a room you have to take care about the cleaning of the house.

1054406,153639369,2017-05-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Thomas made us feel very welcome and went above and beyond to ensure we had a good stay in Stockholm. The apartment had everything we needed and the city centre was accessible using public transport. The lake was an added gem as we spent a few sunny evenings having a drink and enjoying the view.
We would really recommend this Air Bnb to any small groups and families as Thomas is a great host and added to our experience of Stockholm."
299154,318108861,2018-09-03T00:00:00.000Z,This is the 5th year in a row that my partner and I have stayed at Daniel's place. It's the best in Stockholm!
581243,131057488,2017-02-10T00:00:00.000Z,Edwin is very friendly and helpful. He has a central  and cozy apartment. I loved that everything was very clean.

1261445,47473615,2015-09-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Gorgeous, light, beautifully-kept apartment - even better than in the photos! Marie-Louise was the perfect host - easy to contact, ever helpful and there to meet us on arrival. She provided us with plenty of hints and tips for our stay and had, very generously, left some fruit, crisps and sweets for us to enjoy. Not at all expected, but a lovely surprise. The apartment is in a good location, close to shops, restaurants and the metro. It's equally well positioned if you want to walk (and don't mind a good stroll - we managed 27,000 steps one day!) to the more touristy areas. Would definitely recommend."

Very welcoming and nice host, who didn't get upset even when I accidentaly broke a plate. The place was clean, cosy and easy to find. The nieghbourhood was ok - a typical dormitory suburb, but easily accesible from the city centre. The only slight disadvantage (for me) was a strong incense smell in the apartment, but it's a question of your preferences. Overall, a very good experience! Thank you, Alexandre!"
1048260,504781472,2019-08-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Annika's apartment is small,  but very clean with everything you need. There's a small balcony that we took coffee and breakfast (some muesli that she herself provided!) on each day that wasn't raining. All linen was provided. A laundry room in the basement so we were able to wash our clothes before leaving for our next location. 
The only thing I would mention - although not really a negative, was there was no TV"

De kamer en de voorzieningen zijn prima, niet erg modern maar wel een goed (zacht) bed , een koelkast en waterkoker en een lekkere douche. Lidia is een bijzonder aardige en behulpzame gastvrouw die altijd snel reageert. Locatie is prima, dichtbij leuke straten van Södermalm."

Check-in and check-out were easy, and she provided useful information about a locally-known spot to get a great view of the city. Location is a little bit out of the center but there are many public transit options and can totally be walkable if you're up for it. Gracious with tea, coffee and use of her kitchen!"

It is located on a calm street near the crowded center. Nicely decorated and equipped with everything you need. Majken and Emil are the bests hosts we had, ever, with airbnb. Some advice for those who are in Stockholm for the first time: Sundbergs konditoriet on Järntorget is the nicest café. The fish of \"Nystekt stömming\" with potatismus (on Kornhamnstorg) is delicious. And take some time to walk over to Skeppsholmen and have a beer on the ship Af Chapman by sunset. 
Sabine from Stuttgart and Sabine from Celle in Germany"

She was very kind letting me know all the good things/places of the city and close to the apartment.

The only thing is that I went thinking she had internet/Wifi and that was not the case. I could connect to an open wifi over there, but very badly. I would reccomend double check this things with the hosts.

I would come back again (with internet) by sure.

Thanks Coretta :)"

Ok pas d'alcool, ok pas d'animaux etc. Seulement? certains aliments ne sont pas acceptés et ce n'est pas précisé dans l'annonce. Les fenêtres n'ont pas le droit d'être ouvertes alors que je payais quand même une chambre (et le reste)  600 euros, je pense qu'on a quand même le droit d'ouvrir la fenêtre! Et personne ne dit pourquoi. Le ménage doit être fait par la personne qui réserve même si elle paie des frais de ménage. Je pense que quand on accueil quelqu'un et que la personne paie des frais pour le ménage on DOIT s'arranger pour que ça soit nettoyé. Pour ma part j'ai quitté le logement à cause de ça.  Il fallait nettoyé plusieurs fois par semaine car des plaintes avaient été déposées par une personne à l'hôte Ali, alors que cette personne n'utilisait pas la pièce en question (et que, sans exagérer, la pièce n'était absolument pas sale.)  Donc gros problème de communication. Je n'y reviendrai pas et je pense que l'hôte sera en accord avec mon choix. :)"
608672,5065394,2013-06-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Karl is an excellent, friendly host! When we arrived, he greeted us and provided plenty of directions and suggestions. But then he gave us our privacy. The room was very clean and bigger than we expected. More than enough room for me and my wife. Also, the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was also very clean but the shower is complicated to use. Basically, we got water all over the bathroom floor every time we used it. It requires a few minutes of clean up afterward. The apartment's location is amazing. It's in a lovely, safe neighborhood. Only two blocks from Djorrtingham, which is the main pedestrian road with shops and restaurants. Only 20 minute walk to Gamilstan, where you find the royal palace. Honestly, we walked everywhere and only used public transportation to get to and from the airport. Never had to call a cab. We would absolutely recommend Karl's place and would definitely stay here again."
1048668,14607271,2014-06-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Melissa has always responded very quickly. She left us some breakfast + snacks, as advertised on the website - very nice and delicious. The place was cosy and clean with ample space for 2 people. It was also very conveniently located, within walking distances to Metro stations and minutes away from all the main sites like Gamla Stan, Woodland Cemetery, Drottnngholm..etc.. As someone else had mentioned in their review the double bed was very comfortable. Also Melissa left us some maps, brochures and her own information sheet about her favourite restaurants, cafes and walks; a lovely personal touch. A very good experience. (Parking was easy on the road outside the apartment and it stayed there the whole week without problem, while we travelled on the Metro completely)"
164448,46502243,2015-09-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia's place was great. It was clean, comfortable, and had great light. There are 4 bedrooms available for guests on her second floor with a shared kitchen area (microwave, fridge, etc.). All the rooms share a bathroom, which was not an issue. Lidia provided towels and soap, shampoo, tea, and coffee. She was also a lovely host: when we arrived, she offered us coffee and tea and went over a map of Stockholm in her kitchen with us and pointed out the major sites. The apartment is well-located - steps from a major train station and near grocery stores. I would definitely  recommend it!"
688947,69178561,2016-04-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Con Alex fue todo sencillo desde el primer momento: Nos facilitó el parking, nos dio libertad y nos ayudó en lo que necesitamos. El acceso al centro es muy rápido y directo. El barrio es tranquilo. La casa es cómoda, limpia, ordenada y la cocina es muy completa; sólo tuvimos la mala suerte que el wifi estaba en reparación. El resto sin inconvenientes. Recomendable."
700113,154588696,2017-05-25T00:00:00.000Z,The small apartment was perfect for a few days - the balcony and location directly across the street from a popular park was great. :)

La coordinación de la llegada fue óptima, nos esperaba su sobrina a la hora concertada. Anna nos dejó un documento bastante detallado con instrucciones tanto de temas prácticos (electrodomésticos, tiendas, etc) como con recomendaciones sobre los sitios de interés del barrio. Encontré que había bastantes plazas en los alrededores para aparcar en la calle (pagando), un tema que me preocupaba antes de llegar, y el barrio me pareció muy seguro. La ubicación es muy cómoda tanto para ir en metro al centro (estación a 100m) o incluso caminando (20min). También pudimos salir fácil y rápidamente con el coche para nuestras excursiones en los alrededores de Estocolmo. Ademas el barrio tiene su propio interés y está muy bien dotado de zonas comerciales y de ocio. Gracias a Anna por facilitarnos una muy agradable estadía en Estocolmo."

She provides great travel tips if you are visiting Stockholm as a tourist.  Her apartment is located in a convenient location, close to two metro lines.  There are a few rooms, like a small bed & breakfast.  I took the smallest room, which is perfect for a solo traveller.  There are also double rooms available.  I would definitely stay here again on my next visit to Stockholm."

Metro stop and citybikies racks are very close from the apartment. Viktor is also very nice host, he showed us and explained everything in the apartment and he gave us the possibility to check in and out at the time, which suited us best.We highly recommended his apartment.

620848,2505662,2012-10-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Absolutely recommendable. The appartement (two rooms, full kitchen and bathroom) is very cosy and comfortable and we felt at once at home. After sightseeing in the day we liked to come back in the evenings and watch tv or the dvd. It is a normal and nice appartment for people to live in, not something small made up for tourists. Everything is light and friendly. In the living room there is a baby grand piano with a good sound. Hanna and Keith received us with a very warm welcome. She met us at the central station, helped us to acquire our public transportation tickets (which is not as easy as one might think) und accompanied us to the appartement. There we also met Keith and we were received with a cup of hot tea. There was some bread, butter and cheese and some other foods in the fridge resp. the freezer, tea, coffee, oil and vinegar, salt and sugar and some other useful stuff in the fully equipped kitchen. There is a grocery store not so far away. The area is more a normal living area, for other shops or entertainment one would have to go into the city with the local train (commuter train) which goes quite often. The train station is quite close (a few minutes walk). From there one can also take a bus to the biggest IKEA. We also appreciated a basket in the kitchen with city maps and information leaflets. So if we would go again to Stockholm we would certainly want to rent this appartement again and we will recommend it to our friends."

She was really kind and gave us directions on how to get to the apartment. When we arrived everything was really clean and it was way bigger compared to the pictures!

Our room and the apartment were clean and comfortable. We really much appreciated the balcony. Metro station is only a few minutes walk event though we walked downtown (Gamla Stan) most often. 

The only minor issue is that at one point all three rooms in the apartment had guests which made eight of us to share the shower and bathroom. 

Nevertheless, we recommend Peter's apartment for your next stay in Stockholm."

There are lots of restaurants and bars in the immediate vicinity, but walking to Gamla Stan and even further to Norrmalm was quick and easy.  

The only negative I have is that when we arrived, the bed was not made up for us.  Nothing is more of a downer than arriving on your vacation and finding out that you have to make the bed!  Maybe in the future that could be done in advance of the guest.  :)"

There was plenty of space to do things in, without having to shuffle around someone else's stuff and we really appreciated having a washing machine.
There was a problem with the internet when we were there but David was very attentive and tried his hardest to sort it out.
One thing, which is no fault of David's, was that a gym had newly opened underneath the apartment and was very noise all throughout the day including early morning and into the night.
The area is convenient to reach other places but doesn't have so much happening around it.
I highly recommend David's place. It was cosy and felt like home."

I was exhausted when I arrived after a work trip and as soon as I got there, checked in, lay on my bed - I feel into the best sleep I'd had in Scandanavia. Much better sleep than a hotel. Her place just had that safe \"home\" feel. Li was very helpful with directing me anywhere I needed to go in Stockholm. Thankyou Li!"
608672,256653550,2018-04-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Karl's place was perfect for our short stay. Centrally located and very clean, it was easy to get around. Karl was also very communicative and accommodating when our flight was delayed. Would recommend!"
155685,31899981,2015-05-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Geweldige ervaring! Robert's appartement is zelfs mooier dan op de foto's, er heerst ook een hele fijne sfeer. Je verblijft in een fijne (lokale!) buurt en het uitzicht is geweldig! Je kan veel lopend afleggen maar ook een metro pakken. De communicatie met Robert verliep vlot en prettig. 

Thank u so much Robert!"
536283,8315244,2013-10-25T00:00:00.000Z,Perfect apartment that is exactly as nice as in the pictures in Stockholms best neighbourhood. We liked the uncomplicated and easy communication. Thanks.

770995,124169376,2017-01-01T00:00:00.000Z,"We spent 4 nights at Peter's for the New Year - his flat is very well located in the center of the city (we never took a cab / metro during our stay) and nicely furnished 

Peter is very helpful and responsive which is very useful

I would strongly recommend his flat for anyone visiting Stockholm!"
1248490,84686301,2016-07-08T00:00:00.000Z,Maria's home is located in a quiet and upper market area so safety is not an issue. It is also an easy walk to many supermarkets and cafes and restaurants. My family and i love the food at Shanti (Indian Restaurant downstairs) so we went twice in our 4 days of stay. The place is also clean and it was easy for us to cook our breakfast and supper. Kitchen is well equipped. We only wish it was a closer walk to the major attractions as my parents cant walk much so we called for uber. But overall we have enjoyed our stay at Maria's place.
299154,6314239,2013-08-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Great place and great host!
If we will come once again to Stockholm we would stay at Daniel's plase again.
People from Minsk, Belarus recomended this plase for all"
1149820,7383226,2013-09-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Klara's studio is really bright, stylish and lovely as you see it in the pictures... It's well located in the \"new\" cool area of Stockholm, on the edge of Södermalm. It's in a charming old building, you can see big leafy trees out of the window. Nearby there's plenty of small restaurants, there is a long walk on the river side, a big park and a cute island that you can reach in 5 minutes, walking... If you feel like enjoying the night we found some great local concerts at the river (Email hidden by Airbnb) We really loved Stockholm! Keri and Riccardo 

p.s. One thing: the bathroom is really small and the shower is open, so the water goes everywhere, not a big deal but if I could change one thing this is it I would make it more comfy and user friendly..."
954832,25811149,2015-01-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Mikael was a very welcoming and friendly host and gave us many good advices for places to see in Stockholm. He made a lot of useful kitchenaids available for us, so we did not need to bring a lot of stuff with us on the trip. We were in Stockholm for 8 days with our little baby (7 month old) and the apartment was perfect for our needs. There was a little bed for our boy to sleep in, which worked well. We were very happy with the apartment, Mikael as a host and Stockholm, so we hope to visit again when the wheather is warmer and we will definitely recomment this appartment!!"

Christian fue un excelente anfitrión, estuvo pendiente de todo y nos recomendó muchos lugares para conocer y comer. El barrio es muy lindo y tranquilo. 
Sin duda, si volviéramos a Estocolmo nos alojaríamos nuevamente allí."
581243,8172238,2013-10-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin was an excellent host and provided me with a very comfortable stay. His home is located very near public transportation, making it easy to get anywhere in the city. He was also very eager to help me enjoy my visit to the fullest, and made the effort to be as conveniently reachable for me in the event I needed anything at all. I would certainly stay here again.

Cheers,"

628555,5693525,2013-07-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Anna's apartment made a perfect base for us to explore Stockholm from. Though we didn't meet Anna this wasn't a problem, since we could contact her should we need and she communicated very clearly. The apartment was a 10 min walk to the train with a supermarket nearby. The apartment was clean and tidy. All in all a great place to stay."
1271843,287307051,2018-07-08T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed at Andre's flat during our visit to Stockholm. Even though Andre was out of town during our stay he made sure check-in was easy and he was very easy to communicate with. He also gave recommendations on restaurants when needed. The flat was clean and had a comfortable bed and a nice size bathroom/shower. The flat was in an amazing location. It was near to the metro, a supermarket, pharmacy and restaurants. We'd highly recommend staying at Andre's home."

Make sure to follow the directions he sends to you exactly otherwise you will have a difficult time finding the apartment. He was pretty straight forward with very little small talk. Edwin provided information about Sweden, but it would have been nice to learn more about him.  Otherwise he was a good host."

The breakfast is very good, full of international and tipical swedish food.
The house is in a good  place: one J-stop to the city and in the right side to enjoy the nightlife of Stoccolma's Soderlmam and be tranquil during the sleep.I recommend her rooms as a good location for visiting Stockholm."
145320,234271335,2018-02-12T00:00:00.000Z,The flat is so comfortable and Swedish style. This is a 2 minutes walk from nearest station. It is so easy to live because the design of the room makes me feel relaxed. I wanna stay there again if I visit in Stockholm.

Logement très bien équipé (notamment la cuisine qui possède tous les équipements ménagers nécessaires). Il vous sera spécifié que la salle de bain est petite mais nous tenons à préciser que cela ne représente absolument pas un problème (et pourtant mon mari est plutôt grand :)). Un excellent accueil de la part de notre hôte qui nous a attendus jusqu'à minuit et demi car notre avion avait du retard. Marie-Louise avait laissé un frigo et des armoires pleines, ainsi que des fruits. L'appartement était parfaitement propre, rangé. Ambiance très cosy. En bref, on se sent comme chez soi chez Marie-Louise !"

1271843,263876251,2018-05-13T00:00:00.000Z,"We had an amazing time staying at André's apartment. It is in a super beautiful neighbourhood and right around the corner of the subway Mariatorget. André was super responsive and he had great tips for restaurants and things to do. The apartment is very clean and well equipped with everything you might need. I would highly recommend staying here.
And although we did not meet with André - checkin was super easy and he was always reachable when we needed something. Thanks for your hospitality!"

581243,5603210,2013-07-08T00:00:00.000Z,"THE NICEST AND BEST HOST you will ever meet. This was by far one of my best airbnb experiences ever. Upon arriving to Stockholm, we had a fair amount of luggage for just my mom and I. Edwin so kindly agreed to meet us at the train station to help us with the luggage and take us back to his place for no charge! Furthermore, we needed some Swedish currency, he offered to exchange euros with us for an even higher rate than offered by the local exchange office. I mean, come on! He then proceeded to offer us maps and advice on all kinds of Stockholm essentials.
  Other than his hospitality, his place is incredibly Convenient, Safe and Clean. About a 20 minute water side walk takes you to city center, and there is a shopping center with a supermarket literally downstairs from the apartment. My mom and I used his kitchen to make meals both nights. Clean and absolutely delicious! After taking nightly walks, we felt absolutely safe coming home around 11:30 (also because days are longer in the summer). Nice and residential area.
  Honestly, 5 star hotels would not provide you this homely service. What are you waiting for?"
1212891,31881323,2015-05-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud is a perfect host, she makes you feel very welcome, she's also very helpful and gives great advice about Stockholm. Her place is super easy to reach, it is located in a nice neighbourhood, with a homey pizza place and a nice view nearby. The room looks exactly - although much more cosy - as on the pictures. Maud's two cats are very polite and quiet. Overall, staying with Maud is really pleasant and we would love to come back next time we visit Stockholm!"
954832,323353163,2018-09-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Utilizzo Airbnb per viaggiare da anni e non mi sono mai trovata cosi bene! Mikael è un oste eccezionale, gentile e disponibile : al nostro arrivo ci ha dato una piccola spiegazione dei luoghi da visitare e ci ha consigliato alcuni posti dove mangiare e far compere. Inoltre, si è reso disponibile per chiarimenti tramite (Hidden by Airbnb) durante il nostro intero soggiorno! L'appartamento era esattamente come in foto, luminoso e pulito. Posizione molto comoda per spostarsi, la metro (chiamata tunnelbana) cosi come i pullman sono a due passi da casa, ristoranti, bar e supermercati idem. Consigliatissimo a tutti, grazie ancora Mikael!"

Nettan ist sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Die Kommunikation und der flexible Check-in und Check-out haben sehr gut geklappt.
Ich würde jederzeit wieder bei Nettan übernachten."

The apartment is located in very close proximity to a transport hub and we were able to travel a short distance by train to every city location that we required and to catch the airport bus when leaving. 
The apartment is comfortable with an eclectic décor.  As indicated by the owner the bathroom shower arrangement is extremely confined but you get used to it quickly. The owner provided some snack and basic breakfast food  items. The large laundry in the basement enabled us to complete several loads of our washing and drying in a relatively short period of time.
The outlook over the church is very pleasant and the local area is safe and interesting."

536691,16604099,2014-07-30T00:00:00.000Z,"We liked the apartment and the neighborhood very much.  We were in Stockholm during an unusual heatwave, and had to leave the  windows open at all times.  This made the apartment a bit noisy  at night,  but it is quiet when the doors and windows were closed.   It is in a terrific  location  for  going anywhere in a Stockholm -  the subway stop Mariatorget  is a block away, buses on Hornsgatan, and a great neighborhood to walk around in.  Nicely furnished and very spacious.  The kitchen was very well equipped.  I really liked the art.  The fact that there were two balconies was terrific.  Communication with Cecilia was good..  We would gladly  stay there again."

The house is great for staying a little outside the centre (the area is very good for Kids - sweet neighbour kids, ballpark nearby and a Nice terrace to stay on for meals in the summertime) and it is very close to the metro to the city centre."
900043,76094232,2016-05-24T00:00:00.000Z,"We never met Annalie, the only think she told us to so was to leave the flat till 9 a.m. as we did. When I arrived I found the flat durty in particular the bathroom and the wc (but alao the rest of the flat was full of dust and woman hairs). We were 3 people and we had 2 blankets to sleep. There were a few pens, so you cannot cook anything at home and you are obliged to go out for dinner (and the city is super expensive). The flat is close to the center and we visited everything wolking (we never catched the metro)."
723539,35449780,2015-06-19T00:00:00.000Z,"We very much enjoyed our visit to Stockholm and we believe that the location of Mr Nordstöm's apt was one of the best in all of central Stockholm.  The neighborhood was quiet and we felt absolutely safe. It was very convenient to be able to walk from the Metro when we arrived as well as grocery stores, food hall (wonderful selection of seafoods that we prepared in the apartment), harbor, restaurants, museums and various other attractions.  Finding the apartment was easy and the key was available when we arrived.  There was plenty of space and the outside balcony was an excellent bonus."

The place is great and it exudes Scandanavian design in every corner. Gabriella was great to deal with and she did not disappoint on any element of our vacation. We will stay there again.
313195,4473730,2013-05-07T00:00:00.000Z,"I recently stayed at David's apartment with a friend.

608672,305461546,2018-08-11T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment is perfectly located close to the city center and right around the corner of Drottninggatan (pedestrian zone with bars, restaurants and shops). Almost everything is in walking distance. The apartment matches Karl‘s description and he is a very friendly host who gave us great tips for our visit!"
343925,14912159,2014-06-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Annika apartment is very cosy, clean and nice to stay. The bed was comfort, the shower was clean with hot water also the kitchen is clean and well arranged. The apartment is 2 stops from T-Central station by metro, but the metro stations are big and crowded. Near the place there is a big supermarket and mall and restaurants and local bar. Annika is very nice. good communication and very easy to sort things out like taking the key or checking out. 
We enjoy our stay an Annika apartment."
565912,496404432,2019-07-27T00:00:00.000Z,This is a beautiful period house and garden. If you don’t want to be out in the archipelago this place is reasonably close to the centre and I’d highly recommend it.
1261445,25936128,2015-01-30T00:00:00.000Z,"I had a great stay at Mary Louise's place. She's a wonderful host, and place was very clean and nicely designed."

Annika is really nice and friendly!

Perfect place for a couple!"
1096827,460477485,2019-05-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Logement spacieux, lumineux et très bien situé, à deux pas du métro. Anita nous a accueilli avec beaucoup de gentillesse et nous a tout expliqué. Le restaurant au rez-de chaussée ne provoque pas de gêne sonore ni olfactive, et on y mange très bien ! Bien que le quartier soit résidentiel voire pavillonnaire, il y a une boulangerie juste en face de la rue."
1124388,74543771,2016-05-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Me and my two friends stayed in Carl's apartment during our trip to Stockholm and would really recommend it. Carl was a very welcoming and friendly host, giving us detailed directions before we arrived and leaving maps, information etc in the apartment with us for our stay.  The apartment was cosy and well-equipped with everything we needed, and was well located for public transport so we could get everywhere we needed to go really easily."

536283,20524178,2014-09-30T00:00:00.000Z,"L’appartement était conforme à la description qui avait été faite. Il y avait tout le necessaire pour cuisiner. Le quartier est calme et proche du métro et des magasins d’alimentation. Paolo  a toujours aimablement répondu à nos questions, nous avions demandé un lit d'une personne en supplèment, ce qui a été fait. L’avantage pour nous c’est que nos petits enfants habitent le même immeuble, ce qui nous a permis d’être au plus près d’eux. Nous envisageons au printemps de refaire une demande pour cet appartement. Sincèrement rien de négatif pour cet appartement."

954832,38367015,2015-07-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Mikael est vraiment quelqu'un d'adorable. Il répond toujours très rapidement, que ce soit pour réserver ou pour demander un renseignement lors du séjour. L'appartement est bien situé: vous avez deux supermarchés à côté avec d'autres commerces et une station de métro, et pourtant il est dans un petit coin calme avec un accès bien sécurisé (bien qu'à Stockholm il n'y a pas trop de souci à se faire) ! 
L'appartement est également bien équipé, conforme aux photos, la cuisine et la salle de bains marchent bien et sont en très bon état. Bon point pour le lit qui est très confortable car bien moelleux :) 
Je recommande sans hésiter ;)

Mikael is a great and very kind host! Apartment functional, very comfortable bed, good location, supermarket and underground station nearby. Recommanded! :)"

It was a pleasure for us to stay in your apartment. Everything was perfect. Thank you for your help and understanding. We hope to visit you next year. 
Best regards

The apartment is bright, spacious, and exactly as stated in the description. The apartment is perfectly located, only a few minutes away from the metro station and close to the city. 
Terry is a great host. Unfortunately, I hadn't the chance to meet him as person, as my flight was cancelled. But he warmly welcomed my colleagues, and he even bought cheese for us. 
I would recommend the apartment to other guests."
1212891,14396440,2014-06-18T00:00:00.000Z,It is really a wonderful stay in Muad's house. She is so nice that always think of your convenience and try to give you a comfortable stay. And the two lovely cats are so adorable that you will love them!!

Emma is very helpful: she gave us all the explanations we needed before the trip and when arriving.
Very nice apartment, warm and cosy.  We are a family of 5 persons, and it was just fine. 
Very good location: quiet area but close to lots of restaurants.  Also very close from a store (open 7:00-22:00 - very convenient).
Great welcome from Emma (sweets, tea and coffee for the breakfast).
That's the place where we want to be if we go to Stockholm again!
Thank you Emma for sharing your lovely home!"
1261445,456273659,2019-05-21T00:00:00.000Z,"My daughter and I enjoyed a 6 night stay at Marie-Louise’s place. The apartment is in a quiet neighborhood yet close to the subway and busses and many shops and restaurants. Marie-Louise kindly supplied us with everything needed for a light breakfast. We were met upon our arrival by her daughter who walked us through the apartment and explained all the amenities. 

This was a very nice place to stay with lovely views of greenery and the old church across the street. I highly recommend it as a comfortable, well-appointed home away from home in Stockholm."
916806,23366510,2014-11-30T00:00:00.000Z,"The best host ever! We had such a wonderful time. Everything was just perfect. The apartment is very nice, clean, warm, with all the equipment we've need and in the quiet and beautiful neighbourhood. Mansour and Julia are really so nice people, always ready to help with anything. My husband and I were there with our little son (2 years old) and he likes to be loud very often and we know that maybe sometimes he has waked them up :) but they didn't say a word, they were full of understanding. They have even put the warning sign on the main door that there is a baby... We stayed positively speechless. I could write until tomorrow because we're full of positive impressions... Really all the best! Thank you once again for everything, for very nice month spent in Stockholm in a beautiful accommodation where we've felt like at home! Thank you for your kindness, understanding, for being such warm persons. Just stay the way you are. I hope we'll see you again!  Best regards!"

301680,220375285,2017-12-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Anitta’s place is in a very nice and quiet area of Stockholm. But since you are close to the train station in Älvsjö, it’s only a short trip to the city center."
1212891,507915195,2019-08-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Our stay at Maud's was great! The apartment is super clean and is equipped with everything you might need. It is very well located, there is a bus stop just in front of the house and it takes you to the center in 20 minutes. Maud is very nice and will be happy to help you with everything you might need. I recommend it!"
723539,82552484,2016-06-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Mathias flat was lovely... In the heart of the city as everything is more or less walking distance. There are loads of restaurants, bars, and coffee around. The flat is the same we can see on the pictures. The terrace is lovely and Mathias communicated really well. All the instructions were clear.
I strongly recommend Mathias and his flat."

I do really recommend.
Everything was excellent.
Nettan is an excellent person, with a very nice and very much organised house, and I really enjoyed to stay in her house.

The apartment is decorated with charme and style. It's very clean and you will miss nothing. Highly recommended."
581243,27870742,2015-03-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Great location of the apartment, just at the metro station.

When we arrived at the apartment, we were shocked at the well decorated home, everything is very beautiful in Blue and white color with a lot of paintings on the wall.

Edwin also reminded us the time for the Tallink Boat, and told us the way to get there, really nice and helpful.

Next time we will surely choose the apartment again."

The Ostermalm area is within walking distance of the city centre, as well as the main attractions on Djurgarden, Gamla Stan and elsewhere. In addition, the room was comfortable and Jarl was helpful as far as questions on getting around and places to see."

873383,185348396,2017-08-21T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment and room are peaceful, but on a great line that takes you to many central places in the city. About 30 minutes to walk and ride that line to old town. The bed was comfortable, and Isabelle was super helpful answering questions. She invited me to the Outdoor Cinema, and I went two nights. A great way to meet the people who actually live in the area. Very comfortable and convenient place to stay and I highly recommend."

916806,14781847,2014-06-26T00:00:00.000Z,A bit far from metro station. The next room is under renovation.  Overall the appartment is good.
581243,5883115,2013-07-21T00:00:00.000Z,Edwin was a great host! His apartment is super clean and in a great location. He was friendly and helpful. He even did our laundry for us while we went to see the city during the day so we didn't have to worry about it. He will also exchange money from US Dollars or Euro at a better rate than the exchange places. I would highly recommend staying here!
155685,45997208,2015-09-07T00:00:00.000Z,"The flat was nice and tidy, and the area was a cozy one with lots of cafes and places to visit. Robert was a friendly guy, and the books were interesting.

Two things that can be improved/informed about:

The curtains are very light, and for someone it can be difficult falling asleep, and there is a highway with continous traffic, if you're not used to it, it can be disturbing, so would be advisable to bring earplugs and a sleeping mask."
1182616,111863037,2016-11-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Peter is a nice guy, who isn't always with you in the flat. You have your privacy but you also go to meet new people. The City is right next to the flat so you can go by foot everywhere. Thanks for the nice time. :)"
1234960,284820578,2018-07-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Notre séjour en Suède était franchement excellent. Nous sommes restés 12 jours. La maison de Jacob, située dans un quartier résidentiel, est très calme et agréable avec sa grande pièce de vie lumineuse. Le métro n'est pas très loin (5 minutes à pied max) et nous permet de rejoindre facilement le centre de Stockholm en 15 minutes environ. A côté du métro il y a un supermarché ICA qui est bien pratique pour les courses du quotidien. Jacob est un hôte formidable. Il fait en sorte que nous nous sentions comme chez soi. Il est très réactif aux sollicitations par sms ou téléphone. Il ne se passait pas un jour sans qu'il nous communique une adresse pour déjeuner, diner, boire un verre ou nous conseille un endroit à découvrir (nous avons adoré l'île de Sandhamn, Hellas Garden...). Il est vraiment attentionné et fait preuve d'une grande gentillesse. Bref que dire de plus sinon que nous n'hésiterons pas à revenir chez Jacob… et pourquoi pas en hiver la prochaine fois. MERCI BEAUCOUP JACOB ET SOPHIE. A BIENTOT. Stéphane."

Also,  the apartment is close to public transit, a grocery store, restaurants, and a swimming area.  Thank you,  Maud!!!"
1158893,162687202,2017-06-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Wonderful place for larger group, quick access to public transportation and the ferry to Drottningholm. Plenty of space, clean and welcoming. Dany did everything he could to help us enjoy the Stockholm area with info on attractions and transportation. Quiet neighborhood with room for kids to play. We had 9 guest from across the US and give it 18 thumbs up!!!!!!!!!!"
620848,10495911,2014-02-22T00:00:00.000Z,"The flat was perfect for what I needed.  With a welcome at the train station, I don't think they could be more thoughtful about what their guests need or could possibly want.  The place is nicely laid out with plenty of space in each room and it just instantly felt like a home.

Feedback was fast, helpful and they consistently went the extra mile to help.  I would simply thoroughly recommend this place - particularly if you are going to the Stockholmmassan conference centre which is a five minute walk.  

This was so much nicer than any hotel and the welcome set me up for a nice week.  Thanks to both of you."
274876,330240782,2018-09-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Emma is an amazing host. She was extremely responsive and helpful -- before, during and after our stay. She made sure we felt very welcome and comfortable, which was greatly appreciated, especially after our transatlantic travel. As the photos indicate, her apartment is extremely well-designed, decorated and organized. It was also incredibly clean and very functional. The building is also really nice, well maintained and extremely quiet, while just outside, the neighborhood is filled with convenient shops, restaurants and cafes and a wide assortment of cute local boutiques. I've been to Stockholm many times, but I really enjoyed my first experience in Södermalm. It is still very central and offers quick and easy transportation links. I hope to have the chance to stay at Emma's next time I visit Stockholm."
1212891,70062559,2016-04-15T00:00:00.000Z,"This lovely place to stay, its situated in nice area of town. Very easy to get to and from the city due to the metro being only 5mins walk away.  Maud who is the host is very lovely, always had smile on her face! She was very willing to help whenever I needed any. Would definitely recommend this place. :)"
536691,1685060,2012-07-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Cecilia's flat was wonderful, particularly if you enjoy quirky art which leans towards the macabre (we do). Have never been anywhere else that had an exoskeleton/shell decorative theme. Full of character, so we were very happy and at home. Great location, interesting shops and squares very close by and a short walk to Gamla Stan. Very easy to deal with Cecilia."
608672,504227556,2019-08-07T00:00:00.000Z,"The title of Karin’s flat is accurate.  It was cozy, close to any and all that I wanted to do and see.  I was sad to leave.  I stayed 5 nights.  It’s amenities were wonderful, including the laundry room.  The room had a wonderful closet with a little place for coffee, refrigerator, and counter.  Then the room was spacious with a bright window.  I would recommend this location to anyone who likes to spend all day in the city with the crowds but wants peace and quiet when it is time to relax."

The bedroom is clean, everything is great. She respond any messages always quick, and love to help. If I would have a chance visit Stockholm again would love to stay in her place again :)"
1149820,307422589,2018-08-14T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a great stay at Klara's wonderful place! The studio is cosy, stylish, and everything you need is there :) Kitchen is small but good enough to cook for two people (same is true for the bathroom). The neighborhood is also a real treat, lots of cafes and restaurants, and close to the metro station. The local neighborhood suggestions from Klara were very helpful."
1170766,268583557,2018-05-25T00:00:00.000Z,Great location - super easy to hop on the train and get around the city from here. Annika was so helpful the whole way through and very accommodating.
819676,173814166,2017-07-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Leider konnten wir unsere Gastgeber nicht persönlich kennenlernen.
Unsere Erwartungen, wir haben airbnb das erste mal genutzt, waren einfach andere.

Das Zimmer ist klein, wir sind beide relativ groß, das Bett ein wenig kurz und unbequem, aber für zwei, drei Nächte ok. 

Der private Kühlschrank neben dem Bett ist gut gemeint, kann nachts aber störend sein."

1128990,18481537,2014-08-27T00:00:00.000Z,"We really enjoyed our stay at Anette's apartment.  It was very cozy and in a great neighbourhood.   Anette was kind enough to leave supplies for breakfasts as well as plenty of coffee and tea.  There is wifi and satellite tv. The beds were great and the living room was  comfortable for relaxing after a day out. We loved Stockholm and hope to visit again.  When we do, and if we come with our children, we would be happy to stay at Anette's."
1149820,24844557,2015-01-03T00:00:00.000Z,"The place is exactly what it looks like in the pictures. Small, but really cosy. There is a metrostop a 10 minutes walk away, which will take you all around stockholm. The neighbourhood itself had a few nice bars and restaurants. And there is a small shoppin (Hidden by Airbnb) very closeby (with a h&m and grocerystore). We would definitly recommend this place."
1182616,29452244,2015-04-07T00:00:00.000Z,"I didn't see Peter once throughout our 3 day stay. He didn't leave any personalized recommendations about what to do or see in Stockholm. The patio smelled like smoke the entire time we stayed there. The door was really hard to use (to the point where we weren't sure if we would be able to get in at night) and there weren't special instructions. You were expected to squeegee the floor yourself after you showered. Overall, I wasn't super impressed and could have stayed in a hotel that included breakfast for the price we paid for the room."

1128990,79895605,2016-06-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Yvonne was a very friendly and flexible host. She gave us a map to the neighborhood and even stocked up on cheese and eggs for us in the fridge. The room was a bit packed with her things, so hanging jackets in the closet was not possible. The two twin beds were comfortable but we noticed some moths flying around the last night. Location of the room is fantastic. It's walking distance to plenty of shops, cafes, grocery stores, and bars. Overall, a great place!"

The apartment is really nice and it's not that small: I am sure 3-4 people may stay there. Everything was included: towels, linen, hair dryer, kitchen equipment and even coffee and tea. The district is quiet and green -- we even saw three deers near the metro station. There are several restaurants and a supermarket."

It was central, both to shopping and eating places, it was clean and extremely well organised and it was a safe, comfortable and quiet little haven in a gorgeous city.

He is the perfect host; keen to ensure that we had everything, including maps and personal suggestions and the ‘need to know’ tips, like when to book the laundry and what to do when you fail!"

He was very friendly and waited for our late arrival. However, the bed is VERY small for two people, especially given the plywood walls on both sides. Then again, Carl quickly provided us with an extra bed. I’m sure there are apartments with better value, but Carl’s was all in all satisfying."

The apartment was not the one in the pictures and was not the one in the description ( in the description was a 1st floor and the appartment was on a 2nd floor).

We were greatly welcomed and all the much needed instructions and information about the neighborhood were provided in a clear and concise manner.

You can walk there easily in 20 min if you don't want to take a bus or subway.  The apartment is right above a COOP (grocery store) so you can easily get supplies for meals or whatever you may need.  There is no cable TV or internet so bring DVD's to watch if you want.  If you need wifi you have to walk to a 7-11 or cafe."

His son was there but they didn't stay long so we had the whole apartment for ourselves during 3 days and anyway it was really not a problem at all to be the 4 of us in the apartment.

It is just like the description, but there was no wifi (not the first time given previous comments), which wasn't a real issue for us after all.
The mattress on the floor is good for one or 2 nights but not more if you have a sensitive back. The metro indeed takes you to the Center of Stockholm in somewhat 30 minutes : all in all, it took us 1 hour every morning from the moment we left the apartment to the moment we arrived where we wanted to be in the city (we had to use connections).

Overall, this place is a good quality-price ratio !"

The location is perfect and very close to the main sights of Stockholm. Stockholm is walkable, so it's easy to get to anywhere within 30 minutes. The port to boat rides is 5 minutes from the flat.

The apartment was the perfect size for my wife and I plus two kids.  The location is good as you can easily walk to the Metro or along the water to downtown.  We loved the neighborhood with our kids as there was easy grocery shopping nearby, great city parks with kids play areas, and an easy walk to all metro or boat transportation.  Par was super nice and had lots of info about the area to help.  After doing museums and activities for days which tired out the kids, it was nice to have a great neighborhood with parks and even a little beach nearby plus lots of cafes to just relax.  Having a kitchen were we could cook meals for the family really helped make the trip affordable for us."

1054406,293311141,2018-07-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Wij hebben Thomas’ Airbnb zes nachten gehuurd voor ons eerste vakantie in Zweden.

Wij ontvingen onderweg aardige berichtjes, en de verrassing dat er wat kleine boodschappen waren gehaald. Zo was er vers brood, boter, melk, bier, yoghurt, limonade en wat ijsjes. Echt heel aardig en super handig voor de eerste avond en ochtend.

Mijn vrouw, twee volwassen kinderen en ikzelf, vonden ons verblijf een groot succes.
Het is namelijk een schoon, opgeruimd, net, ruim, koel, prettig ingedeeld appartement.Precies zoals de foto’s en de beschrijving op de site vertellen. 

Twee ruime slaapkamers, een ruime badkamer met douche, bad, toilet en wasmachine. Verder is er een ruime woonkamer met open keuken en een prima eetgedeelte.

We hebben een aantal keer gekookt. En als wat je nodig hebt om te koken, is aanwezig. Onze dochter wilde wat strijken, en er is zelfs een strijkijzer.

Ook vonden wij het fijn dat dit een echt gastenverblijf is, dat goed afgesloten en gescheiden is van de privé woning van Thomas’ gezin. Extra verrassing was dat we de privé tuin en terras ook mochten gebruiken. Thomas was zelf een weekje weg, maar kon binnen drie kwartier terug rijden als dat nodig zou zijn.

Al met al een echte aanrader."

All in all, we had such a great time and were amazed by how beautiful the city is.
Thomas was very responsive and helped with every question we had."

My room was facing a spacious and quiet courtyard. Free laundry machines and driers were available in the basement, and Fredric allowed me using the kitchen. The bathroom includes a small, half sized bath tub. It has been a very pleasant time. Fredric’s apartment is in one of the city’s nicest neighbourhoods and very close to Karolinska Insitutet’s Solna Campus, where I spend most time during this stay. As Fredric and I had different work schedules, we often only met briefly. Our interaction was always enjoyable, and Fredric created a great balance between allowing for personal space and offering a sociable atmosphere. Fredric helped me with all of my questions about how to do things in Sweden. I would be happy to stay there again anytime."

It was well located between two metro stops, and only takes a few minutes to get to Gamla Stan (or other central areas). Christian is a lovely guy, always available to contact for any questions. The flat itself is clean, quirky, large, and in a pretty area of Stockholm. 

I would highly recommend it."

954832,369342892,2019-01-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Mikael deserves the designation of a \"superhost\". As soon as his place was booked, he contacted us and gave us a warm welcome. He forwarded lists of interesting places to visit and eat, and things to do in Stockholm via email way before our arrival to help us plan our itinerary. He greeted us as soon as we entered the building, and his place is clean and cozy, enough for the 3 of us. The Fridhelmsplan T-Bana is just a 5-7 minute walk from his flat. There's also lots of eateries around, as well as a mall and 2 supermarkets nearby, an ICA and Coop. All the basic amenities were provided for. I would absolutely rent his place again when we return to Stockholm."

The bathroom and kitchen are very little; cooking should not be planned as you would need to wash your dishes in the bathroom's sink."

Short walk to the tube, supermarket (and a organic shop across the street) nice cafés, good outdoor swimming spot close by, and a lovely park for children at the bottom of the street. We stayed with out 18 month old son, the bedroom he had was blacked out (important in mid summer) with lots of nice toys for him to play with too! 
The apartment is tastefully decorated, with a really comfy bed. And everything you need to make your stay run smoothly. And it's really clean and tidy.
Oskar is good at communication making it easy for us to coordinate with dates and booking flights. 
Stockholm is a great city with so much do, for family's. 
I would totally recommend the city and Oskar's apartment for a great holiday."

The information provided by her was of immense value and her house is located at a comfortable place, just walk for a minute to reach the grocery store and bus stop. The personal touch of picking us up , showing the route , grocery store, providing the access cards and dropping us back , was great. We are touched by the kind gesture.

The flat itself was spacious, clean and modern, and we loved having the terrace. We took a lovely walk down to the frozen lake to watch the sunset. The flat is very close to the Underground Station and we walked there with the pushchair in about 10 minutes. We had everything we needed in the flat including a travel cot. 

All in all we had a lovely time, thank you for having us."

From directions on how to get there till the handover of the keys, everything worked out perfectly. I can only recommend you staying there if you're looking for a nice spot in a great part of town.
All must see sights close by or can be reached via the subway, which is just a few mins away from the apt."

The bed is very comfortable. The apartment located in a very nice area. Bala is very kind to me. During my stay at Stockholm,  I got fever and cold so he give me  medicine and hot tea several time in a day. I definitely recommend Vidhatri’s apartment to other airbnb users."
1262188,410400349,2019-02-10T00:00:00.000Z,Karin’s place is very good value for money. Everything you need is there in a nice appartement in a Central place of Stockholm. Highly recommended!

In the fridge, there were plenty of things to have breakfast.  The flat is a 5-minute walk to the train station and 20-minute to the center of the city.  If I return to Stockholm in the near future, I would look for Jarl once again."
242188,917789,2012-02-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Lovely host and ideal location for Sodermalm as well as getting to the exhibition centre where I was working.

One of the nicest things about the property is the locality to the lake and the garden path that runs alongside it. Great for going on a early morning run or a setting a picnic in the late afternoon."
854975,23870461,2014-12-13T00:00:00.000Z,"This is the third time I have been in their apartment and for sure, If I came back to Stockholm again, I will reserve it again. This winter it was a little cold so he has an extra electric radiator that works perfect for this season.  The location is perfect and close to the bus stop 69 that takes you around the city."

Si vous devez loger à 3, n'hésitez pas à lui demander un matelas supplémentaire (conseil d'ami ;)).
Stockholm est une ville très agréable à taille humaine qui se visite en 3-4 jours. Aussi, n'hésitez pas à bouger vers Malmö par exemple..."
581243,49083777,2015-09-30T00:00:00.000Z,I can only recommend Edwin's place. He is very friendly and is always ready to help with everything. The flat is very good located in the city center!

There is nothing to miss, and it´s the perfect place to start discovering this great city of Stockholm ... wish we had more time ... thank you Malin for your friendly support and the possibility to stay at your home!"
608672,513805409,2019-08-20T00:00:00.000Z,Karin was very helpful and nice. The room is nice for one night but the bathroom without proper shower space is not really convenient.
164448,55928142,2015-12-07T00:00:00.000Z,Lidia stayed up untill 2 at night for us (we arrived late at the airport) with tea and cookies. She was very sweet and welcoming. She gave us helpfull information even that night . The house was nice and the location very good (near the metro). I would love to come here again:)
608672,28227133,2015-03-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Meget god beliggenhet. Leilligheten (1 rom) er helt separat fra vertens leillighet, og helt ryddet til bruk som utleierom.
Huseier var tilstede, tok imot og viste rundt effektivt, og mer så jeg ikke til ham - hvilket passet meg utmerket.
Badet er funksjonelt, men litt vanskelig mht dusjen (blir mye vann utover gulvet).
Vil nok bruke denne igjen!"

628555,299676902,2018-07-31T00:00:00.000Z,"We enjoyed our stay at Anna's home very much. Anna was very responsive and her place is cozy and nice.
It isn't very close to the lively center, but is is also an advantage. The neighborhood is rather quiet, except for the fact that it isn't too far away from a highway ."
1048260,73109059,2016-05-07T00:00:00.000Z,The host canceled this reservation 88 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

Mathias was waiting for us and left us a lot of useful sugestions about things to do in Stockholm. The apartment is very well located, in a quiet residential neighbourhood, but only five minutes away from a central and elegant area of the city. We recommend it."

1153177,105194724,2016-09-30T00:00:00.000Z,My family and I had a great stay at Terry's place. When we arrived late from the train Terry had snacks and even dinner ready for us! The apartment is very comfortable and stocked with everything you need for a comfortable stay. It's very central and only 3-5 minute walk to the Metro. Terry is an excellent host and I definitely recommend this apartment.
299154,11464706,2014-04-04T00:00:00.000Z,"What a wonderful time and fabulous place to stay Daniel was the perfect host and so accommodating. The beds were more comfortable than a Westin Heavenly Sleep, honestly (or maybe we were just too exhausted from a great day of the Palace, Nobel, Ikea.) Super location and perfect directions...and a fab hot shower. We would stay again and totally recommend."
871262,279615479,2018-06-21T00:00:00.000Z,"The location was great for the University, for downtown, and for the central train station. Check in was very smooth, and Lotta provided very helpful information about the city initially, which really made my work visit more enjoyable. The fruit on check in was a thoughtful touch, and the room was very clean and comfortable. Lotta is a clear communicator. All in all, a great stay."
608672,50001512,2015-10-08T00:00:00.000Z,Karl was great host and very informative with lots of information on where to eat and visit.

170651,1117372,2012-04-12T00:00:00.000Z,"At the risk of sounding sycophantic, I cannot recommend Marie and her apartment more highly! Marie is gorgeously friendly and helpful- going well beyond the duty of a host; I was welcomed by a cafetiere in the sun on her balcony and spent the next two hours chatting away and being given invaluable local tips and advice! The apartment is an oasis of bright, light calm and wonderfully located in vibrant Hornstull, just round the corner from the Tunnelbanna (although why anyone would take public transport in a city so lovely to walk around beats me). Five star stay in every way- the only downside was having to come back to London... Go to Stockholm, stay at Marie's, just don't you dare try to book the same days as me (I'll definitely be coming back)! Thank you so much again, Marie. Z x"
242188,307476725,2018-08-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Great location and host! Definitely would recommend it!"

1038408,24655266,2015-01-01T00:00:00.000Z,"We are happy we choose Kristoffer's apartment for our stay in Stockholm. The flat is not big but nice and cozy, and in a quiet neighborhood. Kristoffer wasn't able to meat us but he did everything to make sure we get a key. We had a positive experience overall. Oh, and special thanks for musical instruments."
1234960,31773295,2015-05-10T00:00:00.000Z,"The house was clean has been a real home for our one week instant family. The facilities are good, we loved the trampoline and sauna, the neighborhood is quiet and friendly and the house is close to the tunelbana (underground). The host was friendly, very welcoming and helpful in arranging things for us to make us feel welcome and at home, not only in his house but also in Stockholm. When we had a question he always answered very fast. When he wanted to get something from his house he always asked in advance whether it was ok for him to pass by to get his things.
If we could, we would have stayed much longer :-)
Angelika, Anja, Nina and Elieke"
575371,133013268,2017-02-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Tomas is a wonderful host I have ever seen, he is very nice and he gave us a lot of suggestions for the travel, through those suggestions you can know more about Stockholm, and I believe that you will fall in love with this city. 
The room is very clean and tidy, and it's location is close to all public transports, so you needn't worry about it."
475409,136504724,2017-03-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Cor is a great host. She is cordial and is user-friendly. However, the sleeping arrangement she provided was not the one I booked: I was given the choice of a top bunk bed (bottom was a desk) or a pull out sofa bed. It's one of the most inexpensive rentals you can find in Stockholm, and if she updated the sleeping arrangement I'd re-book in a heartbeat."
581243,265507369,2018-05-17T00:00:00.000Z,Everything was very good!
916806,12750990,2014-05-10T00:00:00.000Z,The tima at Julia and Mansour's was very nice. Their apartment is newly renovated and is neslted in a town right next to a lake and a park with lots of nice walking paths. The terasse is large with a nice view; lots of green. All of my questions were answered promptly. There is a very helpful book for guests that the hosts lovingly put to together. I would recommend the apartment and Julia & Mansour as hosts.
1124388,464301527,2019-06-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Carl war extrem hilfreich und gab sehr viele Informationen, wie wir vom Flughafen zur Unterkunft kommen konnten. Er hat persönlich an der Bushaltestelle gewartet und uns zur Unterkunft geführt. Die Unterkunft ist bestens mit Öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln zu erreichen. Die Bushaltestelle liegt in unmittelbarer nähe. Man braucht ca 5 Minuten zu fuß um zur Fähre zu gelangen, welche direkt ins Stadtzentrum fährt (ca 10 min Fahrt). Die Fahrt mit der Fähre war definitiv ein Highlight. Auf der anderen Straßenseite gibt es einen Supermarkt. Die Wohnung befindet sich auf einer kleinen Insel, welche man in einer halben Stunde umlaufen kann. Ein Abendspaziergang lohnt sich definitiv. Die Lage der Wohnung ist wirklich fantastisch. Die Wohnung selbst ist sehr klein. Wir waren zu dritt und es ist vom Platz her in Ordnung zum Übernachten. Wenn man bei schlechtem Wetter Zuhause bleiben will, ist die für drei Personen wahrscheinlich zu klein. Die Sauberkeit war in Ordnung, jedoch nicht überragend. Eben eine alte Studentenbude. Ich würde sie vielleicht nicht meinen Großeltern empfehlen, jedoch für junge Leute die perfekte Unterkunft für einen Städtetrip."

624886,24857248,2015-01-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Be at home of Oskar is like being in our house. It is the best compliment we can give. The house is lovely and has a light spell. I really liked the receptivity of Oskar, had coffee and chocolates to receive us. The Oskar was always very attentive and was always asking if everything was ok and if we needed anything. We travelled with our two kids and the best part of the trip was without a doubt the kids' room, they neither wanted to exit to the street, only wanted to be playing. Always We ate breakfast at home, going to the supermarket buy organic foods. The metro and bus is very close to home, as well as the airport shuttle bus. It was a fantastic ride and we are sure that everything is due to receptivity and sympathy of Oskar and his family."

299154,56083599,2015-12-08T00:00:00.000Z,It was a very pleasant stay. Daniel was very nice to accommodate our arrival time by leaving keys for us so that we didn't have to travel around with our heavy luggage :). And location is great! Thank you for giving us a pleasant time.
854975,18451029,2014-08-26T00:00:00.000Z,"I was in a real pinch in Copenhagen and was looking for very last minute accommodations in Stockholm. Sergej was the only guy willing to help me out and I really appreciated it.

Sergej was a great host. He was super accommodating and helpful, especially considering how short-notice the trip was. He left some good suggestions for places to go and things to see and do, which was very considerate and helpful if you don't know someone who lives in the city.

Place was great. Close to transport and some nightlife spots. It's quiet, comfortable, clean, and looks just like the photos. Everything a single traveller could ask for."
700113,275488963,2018-06-11T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment is cosy for two people and is conveniently located within walking distance to Odenplan station which is few stops away from major tourist attractions. 

There are also many supermarkets and amazing restaurants in the area (we recommend Burgers and Beer) for your convenience. Nice place for first timers in Sweden."

700113,174590609,2017-07-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Perfect studio room, a few mins walk from the metro and close to many bus stops. Plenty of supplies/amenities provided, and Ilona was a welcoming host."
900043,136716283,2017-03-12T00:00:00.000Z,The house was very pretty. Especially the location is excellent. Great for both the city center and the airport. Christian planned everything and responded quickly to all my messages. I highly recommend to all guests.
647314,8280917,2013-10-23T00:00:00.000Z,"The location of this apartment is great. I bought a 3 day subway pass but ended up not using it much since every place I wanted to go to was walking distance. But when I did use the subway it was so convenient since there's a subway stop around the corner. 

The bedroom looks exactly like in the pictures and has a lovely view to the building courtyard. Mallika was very nice and helpful. There was no problem at all with sharing the one bathroom since she would always let me know if she would be using it for a bath or anything that took some time. Definitely recommend this place!"
581243,3777497,2013-03-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice homely apartment!

No problem finding the place. It's the building connected to the pedestrians' overhead bridge. 

Just follow Edwin's instructions and you won't get lost :)

Edwin was very hospitable and we had no problem communicating. 

Convenience store is just at the ground floor of the same building!

The room was nice and warm. No problem with shower heating.

Flexible check-out time.

I highly recommend Edwin as your host!"
608672,116520156,2016-12-01T00:00:00.000Z,Great place to stay if you're there to explore the city. Very central and only a 2 minute walk to the main shopping street. Karl was welcoming and very helpful with any questions we had about getting around. Highly recommend!!
1212891,330274452,2018-09-30T00:00:00.000Z,Superbe appartement très propre et calme. Propre des transport en commun. Maud est très gentille et serviable.
700113,12614152,2014-05-06T00:00:00.000Z,"I'm an Airbnb newbie but our stay in Ilona's place has been a great experience. The place was as displayed in the description and perfect for our needs. Ilona is a warm and thoughtful host, well-organized, giving tips on what taxi companies not to use, respecting our privacy, all great. I can only recommend staying over here. The location is quiet, some shops (open until 23:00H) further down the street, some bars, ... Perfect!"

Jarl was very nice, always ready to help and always reachable. The neighborhood is very nice and quiet, and you have good public transportation nearby. I did not have any problem finding the place nor moving around."
647314,413796411,2019-02-18T00:00:00.000Z,Very lovely home to stay in at a great location. Would definitely recommend.

1303522,104719847,2016-09-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Camilla was a very welcoming and friendly host.  She was very communicative and would be available if we needed any assistance.  She met us at the bus stop and took us to her apartment, pointing out nearby stores, shops, restaurants and where to catch the train/subway.  Her apartment is in a wonderful location, close to everything!   Her apartment was spacious, clean and had everything we needed.   I can definitely recommend this apartment and would love to stay here again!"
1048260,528424508,2019-09-13T00:00:00.000Z,I loved the plants in the flat and how cozy it is
757320,56642011,2015-12-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Barb's apartment is perfectly located in charming Södermalm which is a very hip and cool neighborhood full of nice bars, shops and happy people. The apartment is on the 6th floor near to Mariatorget, where you have the metro. The place is just a few steps from the shopping street of Södermalm and then the charming old town. 
We stayed in Stockholm over the weekend, exploring the beautiful city. We only needed a room to sleep in so Barb's place was very nice for that matter. Very comfy bed, clean sheets, big window and a shower, practically all we needed. The internet unfortunately didn't work for us.  
Barb was nice and welcoming person."
700113,80137739,2016-06-16T00:00:00.000Z,"This is a great flat for one in the centre of Stockholm, walking distance from the Public Library, shopping district and the central station. Great view from the window, well equipped, balcony (to have a glass of whatever during white nights), fast internet. The hostess was very welcoming and I felt much better and relaxed after my very busy days in Stockholm. I'd recommend the flat to solo travellers there for research trips (like myself) and just having a look around."
776155,153611155,2017-05-21T00:00:00.000Z,"We can't recommend Ann-Sofie's flat enough! We were traveling on business, and the flat is perfectly situated. The neighborhood is very nice--a quiet street in a busy/thriving part of the city. Very walk-able and very close to everything you would need--restaurants, shops, grocery stores/markets, and Metro T stops. It was also very easy to catch a cab or Uber right outside as well. The flat is beautifully-decorated with tasteful, modern furnishings and art--a unique, comfortable space that really makes you feel like you're coming home every day. The kitchen is wonderful, and we loved using the outdoor patio--especially for breakfast. Ann-Sofie was a wonderful, gracious host throughout. She was very communicative, kind, honest, and welcoming. We had a wonderful time, and we can't recommend this flat/experience enough! Thank you."
536691,87804601,2016-07-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Great apartment, great location. Easy check in and check out. Thank you, Cecilia! We had a fun stay."
259722,4938769,2013-06-03T00:00:00.000Z,Great location if working in kista. Marcelo is a nice guy and you're made to feel at home. I had the bedroom which was great.
916806,264941072,2018-05-15T00:00:00.000Z,"The view is really wonderful. And the flat itself is cool too. It is compact and stylish, very clean and comfortable. Big thanks to Julia."
1048260,368855243,2019-01-08T00:00:00.000Z,"One of the best BnBs I've ever stayed at. I would love to live like this. 

Everything as described in other reviews. It was spacious, airy and comfortable for me as a solo traveler.

No lift, you sit on floor cushions at a table, gas cooker and futon on the floor.  If this is all fine for you, you'll have a great stay. 

It's an older building, so it's a bit cold, despite the heater (in winter). It want a problem for me, I brought very warm clothing. 

In loved all the little touches, the plants and that everything was second hand, fair or sustainably produced. It was a great place to destress from a difficult 2018... good location, close to public transport with fast and frequent connections. Close to the city.  Small store opposite the house. Quiet most of the time.

Would come back in a heartbeat.

Annika is a lovely, warm and welcoming host. She answered any query very quickly. Thank you Annika!!!"
916806,523757433,2019-09-04T00:00:00.000Z,"El espacio y la ubicación muy agradable con unas vistas inmejorables y una tranquilidad increíble. La casa estaba muy bien acondicionada pero echamos en falta otro juego de sábanas, toallas y paño de cocina ( un único juego para una estancia de nueve días). 
La llegada fue muy fácil. Mandamos un par de mensajes nada más al llegar a Julia y en el mismo instante nos respondió. 
Fue unas vacaciones inolvidables."
299154,201283215,2017-10-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Daniel´s place is at the best location in Stockholm, from here you can walk everywhere, you have tons of nice restaurants and (hipster) shops and coffee places around. The place itself is small and very packed but it has all the things you need. The place could have been cleaner, but most important was that Daniel was a very friendly host and he was very helpful when we thought we lost our key. He made us feel very welcome. I´d recommend this place if you want to have a great location for little money (for Swedish standards)."
757320,28414375,2015-03-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Barb is a lovely host - helpfull and welcoming and such a discrete presence in the house!
The room is exactly as pictured and the communal bathroom and kitchen that you share with Barb are pleasant and clean.
We found the location of the appartment just perfect for Stockholm! - nice neighbourhood, just next to the metro station, surrounded by fine and value restaurants and cafes, artisan bakeries and Mariatorget park! Everything within walking distance!
Definitely recommend Barb's listing!"
819676,266061240,2018-05-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Location perfetta, fermata metro a 100m per raggiungere qualsiasi meta. Zona molto tranquilla e il proprietario molto cordiale e disponibile! Se vi dovete fermare per qualche giorno ve lo consiglio!"
1170766,16210539,2014-07-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Annika is een vriendelijke gastvrouw.
Zodra wij aankwamen vertelde zij dat het moeilijk is de ruimte te verduisteren.................Helaas klopte dat!
Overdag is het een fijne lichte studio, met transparante rolgordijnen voor de openslaande deuren naar het balkon en met verschillende ramen in het plafond.
Vanaf 04.00 wordt het daardoor helaas dan ook al heel erg licht.
Als je gewend bent in een donkere kamer te slapen, kun je beter vanuit thuis slaapmaskers meenemen.
Wij waren in juli (heerlijke 27 graden)te gast. 
Aangezien het een zolderstudio is, zou ventilator fijn zijn geweest.
De locatie is prima. (bv 15  minuten te voet naar Gamla Stan)
De wijk is gezellig, met winkels (open van 7-23) en horeca en mooie picknickplaatsen op loopafstand."
1212891,135077111,2017-03-03T00:00:00.000Z,"It was BRILLIANT 
The communication before the stay was perfect - Maud was so helpful and responsive. She even waited quite late at night because we took the wrong metro.

When we arrived, Maud was patiently giving us all practical information about the house. They were even written too, so it was really handy!

About the room - it was super clean and well-equipped. Couldn't have asked for more.

Overall, the stay was perfect and even better than staying in a hotel. Thank you so much for the hospitality, Maud and Sammy! It was really nice meeting you."
1153177,14200337,2014-06-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Terry's place was wonderful.  Just as pictured, very roomy for our party of 5.  The 2 balconies were amazing.  We walked everywhere from there and found on of the best restaurants we ate at close by.  He greated us with a meal and was very friendly.  Would highly recommend."
1212891,457049059,2019-05-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud’s place was very cozy and comfortable. It was absolutely clean. She is a great host and gave very specific instructions about everything at the apartment. The house was very well kept and organised. Sammy, her cat was non-interfering and friendly. 
The bathroom was super clean and Maud had kept so many shampoos and creams for us to use. There were colour coded sections and towels for the guests of each room. I liked that idea very much.
We had a great stay at Maud’s place."
757320,6753689,2013-08-24T00:00:00.000Z,"We had such a great time at Barb's place ! The appartment is very well located (just 10 min walking to Gamla Stan and at the top of the street corner, you'll find a very nice view over the city). The area was laid back and very secure (like everywhere else in Stockholm), close to a lovely park and nice shops and restaurants around. Regarding the appartment itself, although you share it together with Barb, you will feel like having your own privacy. It is very clean and cosy. Access to kitchen and fridge. The bedroom is in a corridor right in front of the bathroom, which is very convenient. The bathroom sharing was not a problem at all, it worked out perfectly. Barb is such a nice person, we really enjoyed chatting with her. If we come to Stockholm again, we'll definitely go back at her place. Very recommanded ! Barb, thank you so much for having us ! All the best :)"

Nous avions tout le confort décrit dans l'annonce. Le logement est situé près d'un métro qui mène au centre en 20 minutes.
L'appartement est très agréable, lumineux et la chambre spacieuse.
Toutefois le jour se lève très tôt (à 4 h du matin) et la chambre n'ayant pas de volets la lumière est vite intense donc pensez à prendre un bandeau pour les yeux ;-)"
608672,44107000,2015-08-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Modern room with separate pantry and bathroom. It is a typical - small! - city flat. The place is nicely located in the city centre in a quiet street but close to the main street and subway station. Plenty of tourist information available and the fruit that was waiting for us, made us feel welcome. Communication with the owner before our arrival and during our stay was very clear and open. We had a great time in Stockholm!"

Wir haben uns vom ersten Moment sehr wohl gefühlt, so dass wir unseren Aufenthalt sehr genossen haben. Nathalie ist uns sehr sympathisch. Ihre Wohnung ist sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet und ist sehr sauber. Der Stadtteil Kungsholmen hat uns sehr gefallen: sehr gute gastronomische Vielfalt und Spitzenmöglichkeiten für Einkäufe; Verkehrstechnisch mit U-Bahn und vielen Buslinien optimal angebunden. Unser Tipp: die Bar auf (!) der Mälarsee. (Mälarpaviljongen)"

Terry met us on arrival, gave us a few tips then was on his way and available via AirBnB text the whole week. We traveled with two small kids and Terry added some nice touches to make our stay more comfortable.
Also nice was the size of the Home, full kitchen, clothes washer, elevator, secured entrance, and two baths. 
The best part about Terry’s flat is the location. It’s so close to everything and easy to get anywhere in the city. Public transportation is a breeze! 
Thank you Terry!"

The flat is well located, the bed was comfortable and the room spacious. However, although superficially clean, the flat was a bit dusty and grimy in places and being in the bathroom wasn't very pleasant as there was quite a strong smell from the drain for the shower. Also, some of the furniture was a bit tired. It is a shame because it is fundamentally quite a nice flat and would be much nicer place to stay were it thoroughly cleaned, some of the furniture replaced and the bathroom refitted with a U-bend on the shower to prevent drain odours."

It’s a block away from the Slussen station, which made it very easy to explore other parts of the city. My friend and I stayed for two nights and really enjoyed our stay. The apartment is very clean and stocked with amenities (fully stocked kitchen, hot water maker, tea, big screen TV), and the bathroom was also very clean. 

Highly recommend!!"

819676,233568722,2018-02-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Expérience lamentable...
Accueil mauvais, j'ai attendu un message du propriétaire pendant 2 bonnes heures après mon arrivée à l'aéroport. Par chance, j'ai réussi à rentrer dans l'immeuble. Une fois au 6e, j'ai sonné et une dame m'a ouvert la porte, visiblement très fâchée, elle m'a montré une chambre à gauche, sans autre accueil, ni information.
La chambre est très petite et se trouve directement à l'entrée de l'appartement. Les sanitaires sont en face ( agréables ). Je dis cela parce que quand le propriétaire ou sa femme rentre le soir, vous serez dérangés. 
La deuxième nuit fut épouvantable, car la femme du propriétaire a fait du trafic toute la nuit et a quitté l'appartement à 5h du matin. Impossible de dormir, malgré mes demandes réitérées de faire un peu de silence.
Ces gens selon moi traversent une mauvaise passe... et n'ont pas de temps à perdre avec vous ni d'égard concernant la tranquillité.
 
Je ne peux que vous recommander à éviter cette location en allant bien vite voir ailleurs."
1243144,6107395,2013-07-30T00:00:00.000Z,Great place to stay if visiting Stockholm.  We stayed 3 nights and managed to explore different parts of of the city from this location.  It is just south of the old town (walking distance) and a metro station is in the neighbourhood.   The apartment is very attractive and comfortable.  Definitely recommend it.

His place is just as described and fit our needs. It may be a bit cramped for more than 2, but it worked well for us, as we spent most of our time exploring the city. We also enjoyed making some meals at home in his kitchen. Daniel was very responsive and helpful to us in planning our trip. We recommend Daniel’s place!"

Direkt im Stadtteil Södermalm, nahe am Nachtleben, eine Unmenge an Möglichkeiten Essen zu gehen, tolle Läden von grossen Ketten bis zu kleinen Designerboutiquen. Und trotz der zentralen Lage ist es ausgesprochen ruhig. Wer also gerne Unterwegs ist (Die U-Bahn ist in wenigen Metern zu erreichen) und trotzdem beim, nach Hause kommen seine Ruhe möchte ist hier gut aufgehoben. Der Gastgeber ist toll. Die Kommunikation lief einwandfrei, wir bekamen immer sehr rasch Antwort auf alle Fragen und Anliegen."

The house is very well located: there is a bus down the street that drops you off at the metro station. You are in down town is 20 min!

The apartment is beautiful and is a great value, especially compared to the high prices of hotels in Stockholm.  It took us about a half hour by train to get from the apartment to downtown, but the apartment is located very close to the station.  If you don't mind staying outside of the downtown area I would highly recommend this location."

It's just a few stops away from Stockholm Central station and a nice place to unwind after a day of sightseeing. Everything was great about our stay and I would without hesitation chose to stay there again. Thank you, Hanna and K!"
274876,534000005,2019-09-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Emma’s place was just perfect. The location is very quiet, yet close to many shops and restaurants, and just a short walk to the Old Town. We are a family of 5, and Emma’s place had plenty of room for us to be comfortable. Emma left breakfast for us, and the kitchen was stocked with everything we needed to make breakfast before heading out for the day. Emma left tips on local restaurants and some of her favorite sites, as well as some tips about the Swedes. Beds were super comfortable and black our curtain in the master was fab. We would recommend Emma’s place, and would stay here again if we return to Stockholm."

The offered room is in the upper part of the apartment. You share bath and a nice living room with other guests. The location in Södermalm is great, also quite close to public transport. I had a wonderful stay and can totally recommend this place."

Marie is really easy to deal with and we had no problem arranging for the keys even though our plane landed close to midnight.
The area is really convenient! you will find nice little restaurants, supermarket, bakery, tube/bus station within few hundred metres. Also one of Stockholm \"beaches is not far from the flat.
I'll be back in Stockholm and most probably in Marie's flat!"

Edwin was extremely helpful. We had some problem during our previous leg of our trip and Edwin helped us made some phone call to expedite the matter. We wouldn't have solved the matter so fast had it not for Edwin.

His room is neat and clean with a well stocked kitchen. His apartment is also right in the middle of Stockholm central. It is walkable to most sights and attractions from the room."

368952,5150135,2013-06-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Madeleine's house is beautifully located, in the forest outside Stockholm. She is a lovely, friendly hostess and makes her guests very welcome.She collected me from the Metro station and brought me to the shopping centre/supermarket. She also very kindly worked out my transport routing using local transport services - these are very efficient but not user-friendly for foreigners so Madeleine's help was invaluable. The accommodation was very comfortable - it was private but Madeleine allows her guests to make full use of her main house."
1212891,348510366,2018-11-14T00:00:00.000Z,Maud and Sammy are perfect hosts. We got nice tips for the best places in Stockholm and enjoyed our stay there very much. Thank you Maud

He has welcomed us in his apartment after our flights with a bottle of wine! The apartment is nice, clean and really beautiful, we were four people and it was perfect. The location is really convenient, there is a bus from the airport to his apartment and it is near the subway. I recommend this flat to everybody for a trip in Stockholm and I will come again in Anton's flat if I have the occasion!"

The apartment isn't in the center of most attractions, but it is within walking distance of many and access to public transportation is just fine, so that's not a problem. Check-in/check-out was easy, and the place was very clean for us. Would definitely stay here again."

164448,20912470,2014-10-07T00:00:00.000Z,Lidia was a wonderful host. I travelled to Stockholm for the weekend with my mother and had a lovely time staying with Lidia. Her directions to the flat were spot on and she made us feel very welcome. The room itself was very clean and cosy. Lidia's morning breakfasts were delicious and enough to accommodate all tastes. I highly recommend staying with Lidia and I definitely will next time I am in Stockholm!

In the kitchen and bathroom everything is labeled clearly, so things are easy to find and it is easy to see what can be used.
Even with 4 people sharing the flat there were never any problems with bathroom or kitchen times.
Be aware that the bed is not extremly wide and a little bit worn, but it was ok for us.
The location of the flat is perfect for visiting Stockholm, as the metro stop is very near, and all the trains of the green line stop there. It was also very clean, even though there are 2 cats."

1271843,10049736,2014-01-27T00:00:00.000Z,"It was a right choice to stay at Andre`s apartment. The location is in the most interesting part of Stockholm full of bars, restaurants and small designer shops. There is a metro station in 5 minutes of walk from the flat. 
Right after booking Andre got in contact and gave us very precise manual how to get and what to do. We got in very smooth. Thanks Andre it was easy to communicate.
The apartment is very clean and spacious with fully equipped kitchen and big common room. There are no animals inside. The room has enough space for two persons to stay on several days.
Nothing to complain. It a was a good place to stay for our short shopping binge :)

Denis"
1038408,518044304,2019-08-26T00:00:00.000Z,"- Mattress & bedding: 
1. The duvet and pillow stank of sweat etc. Covering it with a washed pillow case & duvet cover did not disguise the smell (i bought my own duvet & pillow the next day).

2. the mattress was old and sank in the middle. Another guest had already remarked that it was soft (and a personal preference). Preference has nothing to do with it. It's old and sinking.

- Bathroom: it's dated and for a few days you could cope. But after a week it doesn't make you feel clean. The sink has stains on it that no amount of cleaning can remove. And let's not mention the toilet. The shower head doesn't stay up. The shower curtain stinks.

Location: 
It's an hour away on foot to the city centre. You can cycle there (if it's not snowing) otherwise you'll need to use their public transport which is expensive. 

Size: it's more a studio than a 1 bedroom flat. The \"bedroom\" is really small it can only be described as a box room with a single bed. Two guests would not comfortably stay there. There is a sofa but that's not the most comfortable either and there's no extra bedding."
313195,4917511,2013-06-02T00:00:00.000Z,"We were 2 couples and stayed 3 nights in David’s apartment. He was there when we arrived (very late at night!) gave as the key and all the instruction we needed. The apartment was clean with fresh sheet on the bed + towels for the bathroom. There is a Supermarket just around the corners and a Metro Station 8 minutes walking. The only thing which was a little bit annoying was the gym next to the apartment, which was noisy in the morning. But nevertheless we enjoyed our stay in David´s apartment a lot – Thanks David, you were a great host and we would definitely come again!!"

565912,35323940,2015-06-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Patrik's house is located in the very posh part of Gröndal, as soon as we arrived at the front door my friends and I couldn't believe how beautiful the house was, with well kept flowers and plants everywhere. The pictures on airbnb don't seem to do it justice. On entering the house we knew that we were home. The house is very spacious and has so much character. Patrik was kind enough to map out where we can find the groceries, bakery and even the perfect spot for a morning jog. The four of us slept very well at night, and having 2 bathrooms meant that we never had to wait to take a shower or use the facilities. The neighbours are very friendly and helpful, they even told us how to get to the river bank which is literally 3mins walk away from the house. I cannot fault the house at all,however, our only regret was that we didn’t get the chance to meet Patrik and the family to thank them in person for allowing us to stay in their lovely house, especially when we were finding it very difficult to find accommodation on airbnb. Hats off to Patrik and family for being the PERFECT! hosts."
