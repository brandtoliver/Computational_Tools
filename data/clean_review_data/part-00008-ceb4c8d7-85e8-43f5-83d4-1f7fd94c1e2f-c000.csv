536691,17818181,2014-08-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Cecilia made arrangements for us to pick up the keys to her apartment at a nearby cafe. Once we had the keys and the code to the downstairs door, we were happily ensconced in Cecilia's truly beautiful Stockholm apartment.  It is very large, with a living room, bedroom, and eat-in kitchen, plus TWO balconies. Unlike many apartments that we have rented, this one was obviously not simply an investment rent-a-place, but her very own apartment. We felt like we were friends who had made arrangements to use her place while she was out of town.  This intimacy had some distinct advantages. The kitchen, for instance, was fully equipped and set up because Cecilia, who we would guess is an excellent cook, had cooked there recently herself. It was a pleasure to prepare meals there and eat at the little kitchen table. The art on the walls and the various objets de art throughout the apartment always provided visual entertainment and often food for thought. The apartment was very clean and, well, charming. The only drawback was that there was not a lot of space for us to stow our own stuff, but we quickly figured out that minor problem and enjoyed ourselves in this sophisticated and beautiful space.

The location was also very satisfying.  Located on one of the main drags in Soderholm, filled with cafes and small shops, the apartment was an interesting fifteen to twenty minute stroll to the Gamla Stan, Stockhplm's old town. There were grocery stores within a half a block, subway stations five to ten minutes walk, and the one of the City Bike stands was only a few blocks away. I should also mention that although the flat is on the fifth floor, there is a dependable lift.  

If you a re visiting Stockholm and get a chance to rent this apartment, don't hesitate."
1124388,54407408,2015-11-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Terrific place, terrific host. The place is amazing, it's easy to reach, well connected, has shops and cafes nearby. Good soundsystem and a small collection of vinyl adds some charm. We had fully enjoyed our short stay and would definitely like to rent it again next time we're in Stockholm."
347192,71424498,2016-04-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Matilda's flat is gorgeous and bright, as the pictures show.  Its in a great location close to Slussen station and lots of shops.  She kindly allowed my friend and I to bring our 9 month old babies. Communication was good between us and Matilda was helpful with any questions I had.   Unfortunately the second bedroom is without a door or curtain."
442837,478817449,2019-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Jo's place was a very comfortable stay for an extended weekend in Stockholm. It is literally only a few steps from the metro station, and very easy access to places e.g. Sodermalm and Gamla Stan. The room itself was clean and bright, and Jo was very helpful in helping me find the place when I arrived. She also offered great tips on things I was interested in, including great running paths and events going on that weekend. I would highly recommend staying with her!"
556363,36471487,2015-06-28T00:00:00.000Z,"We enjoyed our stay and can definitely recommend this apartment.
Great location in heart of city across from Metro stop with lots of great restaurants within a short walk.  Great top apartment with good view of local city buildings.  Nice amenities including well equipped kitchen, washing machine and great TV and stereo.  Thank you, Lennard!"
1205051,5713087,2013-07-13T00:00:00.000Z,Great place with a lot of character in a cool area. Viktor was very responsive to messages and our impression was one of warmth and friendliness. I would highly recommend staying here. Thanks again for having us Viktor!
916806,20527915,2014-09-30T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed at Mansours apartment from 25th-29th September 2014 whilst visiting a friend in Stockholm.
Mansour greeted us when we arrived. He was very friendly and provided us with information about the local area.
The apartment was very comfortable, clean, peaceful and well placed for visiting Stockholm by train (only 20 minutes to the centre of town)
It well also well placed for IKEA and a big retail complex at Kungens Kurva (only 5 minutes by car).
This was our first booking through Airbnb and went without a hitch. We recommend this apartment."
1173290,6635637,2013-08-19T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a wonderful time in Stockholm. Christian was a great host--very helpful with tips about the city, transportation etc. The location of the apartment was perfect;  well situated for access to public transportation, a few minutes walk to a grocery and many restaurants. We were there with our two young children and the Astrid Lindgren park was a short walk away. The apartment itself was lovely and newly renovated. It was very quiet, situated on the back side of an inner courtyard, had two great balconies, and the decor was modern and artistic. To our children's delight, Christian kindly invited them to play with any of the toys in the house. A great vacation week for us!"
795354,187069414,2017-08-26T00:00:00.000Z,Gustav's place is great. The apartment is located very close to the T-banna (Stockholm subway) and central enough to reach anywhere is Stockholm in a short amount of time. Gustav is an excellent communicator and a great host. Highly recommend!
875505,71832183,2016-04-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Electra went above and beyond to accommodate me and make sure I had everything I needed. She is extremely friendly and caring and couldn't have been a better host. Her apartment was very tasteful and had everything I needed for an enjoyable stay. Its location is unbeatable close to many shops, restaurants, and cafes right in the heart of Stockholm. Overall, I was very happy with my stay there."
1261445,38103596,2015-07-13T00:00:00.000Z,Marie Louise picked us up at the tube station due to really horrible rain. That was really nice. She had fresh fruits ad some sweets for us.
1184553,176902023,2017-08-01T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a comfortable stay at Annbritt's place. The location is great, walkable into the city. I would probably recommend hiring the city bikes that can be done for 3 days and the passes can be purchased from 7/11 to get around the city. Although our stay was great, keep in mind when looking for a place that the city is very expensive for meals so it would've been handy to have kitchen access that we did not have here."
1271843,34575016,2015-06-09T00:00:00.000Z,"I stayed in Stockholm for three nights and managed to meet Andre on my last night -he was flexible due to my arrival dates and friendly along with his partner!  I had an awesome stay and the location of the apartment was perfect!  Very close to the metro and cool bars etc. Very hospitable, lovely and chilled out couple...thanks guys :)"
1182616,498175537,2019-07-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Very clear and good apartment in a fantastic position! 
10 minutes geom the bus station and in 15 minutes you are in The city center!
Peter is a Gret host!"
1307331,5718664,2013-07-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Una gran bella sorpresa (ed un ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo) questa casa, accogliente e spaziosa, un assaggio dell'atmosfera che gli svedesi sanno creare con il loro eccellente gusto per l'arredamento. A 15 minuto dal centro di Stoccolma, immersa nella natura. Abbiamo avuto come ospiti due caprioli e uno scoiattolo (rosso!). Permette una diversa prospettiva sulla città, che è davvero a portata di mano, con l'abbonamento normale per i trasporti pubblici."
164448,1061038,2012-03-30T00:00:00.000Z,"It was an amazing stay! The room was lovely and had everything that i could have needed. Even some maps and guidebooks! Lidia was an excellent host and explained everything very clearly. The location was so close to the central. 
I would definitely love to go back to stay at her place again!
I thank you very much for your hostpitality, Lidia, and hope to visit again!"
347192,25799240,2015-01-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Good neighbourhood to stay at. Well located and near everything you could need. Mathilda was available for all our questions via text. Info could have been a bit more but still it was more than plenty for us. Apartment could be a bit better cleaned though, because there were (although they were clean) dishes lying around and also a dirty towel in the bathroom and a stinky cheese in the fridge. For the rest everything was great. Apple TV for good comfort was a nice add on as well. All in all, happy with our stay."
819676,183515925,2017-08-17T00:00:00.000Z,When you stay there you get exactly what is stated the description. They are very detailed which helps if you are new to area such as myself.
343925,15952626,2014-07-19T00:00:00.000Z,Nice and cosy apartment. The apartment was very clean en the host was very nice. She Also had a big stack of brochures of stockholm!
536283,100657188,2016-09-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Paolo was very easy to contact.  His apartment is in a great location and a great size for two people. The living area gets lots of light (good during the day, maybe not so good at night if you're a light sleeper).  The kitchen area is quite new and easy to use.  The bathroom is older but quite clean."
739726,3010144,2012-12-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Sannas apartment is one of those places on AirBnB that you feel lucky to have stayed in once you've been there. It's a nice  space in Södermalm. Steps away from Cafés, very nice stores and a short walk to everything else in the neighborhood. We would stay there again. Sanna was very easy to communicate with before and during the stay. That's always helpful!"
845365,266047062,2018-05-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Michael is a very welcoming friendly person and really a super host. The room was clean and comfortable. There were all the tools and machines for cooking, so I felt like I was in my home. The bathroom and the toilet were clean and servicing.
Thank you, Michael !"
904739,37325362,2015-07-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Menaf was a very friendly and very helpful host. His apartment is perfectly located in Södermalm - a very hip part of the city. The apartement is fully equipped, bright and clean. Métro and a lot of nice restaurants and cafés are nearby. You can park right in front of the door. We had a super nice stay - totally recommendable."
299154,49440156,2015-10-04T00:00:00.000Z,Daniel apartment is clean and conveniently located and Daniel is a very nice and flexible host.
442837,517275864,2019-08-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Jo is a quite and open-minded person. Her flat is really closed to the metro, the mall and the lake. It was my first experience of Airbnb and I really enjoyed it ! I recommend her !"
739726,3761409,2013-03-12T00:00:00.000Z,sehr gut danke
974175,19649015,2014-09-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Sofie's apartment is absolutely lovely, in a great location (just a couple metro stops from the city center), and sleeps four adults very comfortably. Sofie was also very helpful and completely responsive in her communications! Highly recommend!"
581243,72533053,2016-05-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Very nice 1 night stay.. beautiful, clean flat with a very friendly host. I highly recommend staying here!"
1212891,68293736,2016-04-04T00:00:00.000Z,"I spend four weeks in Stockholm and lived in Maud's flat, which was just the right choice! I enjoyed the cordial and welcoming atmosphere she creates, I felt to be at home quickly and had everything I need. I appreciated the little extras like coffee, tea, oil, shampoo,.. and just living with someone who welcomes you heartily after a long day!
Thank you, Maud!"
1182616,68798825,2016-04-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Very comfortable and warm room with a balcony, I love it"
854975,13215058,2014-05-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Nous avons passé 6 jours à Stockholm, et c’était notre première expérience avec airbnb. Nous en revenons enchantés. L'appartement de Sergej correspond exactement à la description: très confortable pour deux personnes, très calme, dans un quartier agréable à 15mn à pied du centre. Avec les cartes citybike mises à la disposition par notre hôte, nous avons pu profiter des vélos (station tout proche).
Sergej a depuis le début de notre inscription répondu rapidement et efficacement à toutes nos questions. A notre arrivée, n'étant pas lui même à Stockholm, tout était prévu pour nous rassurer: Sergej était en contact avec nous par sms et pour l'entrée dans l'appartement: un ami à lui était présent. Des rafraichissement, le petit déjeuner, le linge de toilette et la literie étaient prévus pour notre confort.
Un grand merci à Sergej, notre seul regret étant de ne pas avoir eu la chance de le rencontrer. Peut être une autre fois!"
819676,429829267,2019-03-29T00:00:00.000Z,Within walking distance with old town and close to many great restaurants. Spacious room and toilet. Excellent!
1205051,16398830,2014-07-27T00:00:00.000Z,Viktor's place was great! Nice furnished. It's in a great location and you really feel like a local staying there. We spent most of our time exploring Sodermalm which was great fun. Viktor was very helpful and made checkin easy! When you go to Sweden stay here!
533880,3364653,2013-01-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Very nice and conveniently located. Great host! I enjoyed a very easy going and uncomplicated stay. Since I need to study some hours, the working desk was perfectly useable in combination with the available WiFi. Even sauna was available to relax.

I can highly recommend to stay at Jarls."
301680,29990472,2015-04-15T00:00:00.000Z,"The house is so great. Anitta is such a kind person and helpful. Being at Anitta's home make me feel like staying at my own house. The neighbourhood is so quiet, perfect for people who need to relax after studying, working or just rest after a great walking vacation day! The house is perfectly connected to the city center by bus, train or metro. 
The house is like the photos show, so clean, everything functions perfectly! I warmly recommend it!"
873383,62511773,2016-02-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice place to stay !!! 
Isabelle and Dan are to wonderful people 
They made me feel home comfortable and helped in every step of the way !!!

954832,8921464,2013-11-25T00:00:00.000Z,"I am currently doing an internship in Stockholm and share an apartment with my team, which is mostly made up of men. I was getting burnt out and just needed a few days of quiet to myself (without guys around!), so I contacted Mikael. He was great at accommodating me at last minute. He responded to any questions and such extremely quickly through text, and I was left alone for the most part; which is what I wanted. The bed and the sofa is super comfortable and the floor heating on the bathroom was great!

I really enjoyed my stay and Mikael flexible check-in and check-out really worked to my advantage. Althought it might be a little pricier than other places in Stockholm, the location, the discreet service, and the awesomeness of Mikael really is worth it. 

One more thing I need to mention is that I needed to stay an extra night and Mikael got back to me right away on that and said it was okay for me to book an extra night through airbnb. I wish I was able to talk to him more, but well, that's not why I was staying there haha."
819676,137540716,2017-03-16T00:00:00.000Z,"とても広々としていて､ｽｯｷﾘとしたｲﾝﾃﾘｱの揃った素敵なお部屋でした｡AndyとVannieは温かく迎えてくれて､最後の夜には､仕事で疲れているだろうにも関わらず簡単な食事に招いてくれました｡また家の周りには､観光客が普段あまり訪れないような素敵なお店がたくさんあり､ｼｮｯﾋﾟﾝｸﾞも楽しめました｡
Andy&Vannie's place is awesome! There are many good small shops near the flat. Also you can visit Gamla stan, center of the city very easily by walk. I was happy to share a table and have a talk with them! I'll come back again;) Thank you."
274876,301315225,2018-08-04T00:00:00.000Z,Un piso muy agradable y céntrico. Recomendable.
647314,256226258,2018-04-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Super appartement de Malika. Très bien placé et agréable à vivre. 
Le métro est à côté, le quartier très sympa.
Je recommande !"
974175,29379585,2015-04-07T00:00:00.000Z,It was really lovely at Sofies'. Me and my Family had a great time in this amazing flat. Everything went very smooth and easy and I Would definetely recommend a stay there of you're planning a short Trip to stockholm.
581243,426468105,2019-03-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin发的路线描述很复杂,但其实很好找,就在地铁口出来的后方,如果配合地图的话就更加一目了然｡所在位置交通很方便,小区下面还有一个购物街,所以生活很便利｡房间配备的设施都很齐全,相对价格而言已经很好了｡"
1271843,159960650,2017-06-12T00:00:00.000Z,"the host is very nice and the location is very convenient, grocery stores within walking distance."
1212891,61559718,2016-02-06T00:00:00.000Z,"We spent two nights at Maud's and liked it a lot! Maud is how others describe her: a warm and caring person. She immediatly told us some do's and don'ts in Stockholm and made us feel very welcome. Every room is adapted to frequent visitors and to make it an easy stay for them. We slept in the purple room, which is not too big, but very cosy and it has everything you need. The bed is big enough for two (couple or just friends), if you don't need too much space and don't mind sleeping close to each other. The environment is a good living environment, but we always went for breakfast to the old city and got back after dinner. One morning, we walked along the frozen river from Maud's to the City Hall, which was beautiful! 
We didn't stay long enough to use the kitchen, so we can't say anything about that, but everything was neat and available to use. 

I can only conclude that it is a nice spot, a great lady and a stay I would definitely recommend."
1153177,335391873,2018-10-12T00:00:00.000Z,very nice and friendly!
568341,529316811,2019-09-14T00:00:00.000Z,Sam was a wonderful host to guide us through the architectural wonders of Capitol Hill. He knew his history and kept the group moving efficiently. It was a fun tour and easy to walk.
1128990,174503248,2017-07-26T00:00:00.000Z,Anette is a very friendly and welcoming host. The room is of good size for one person and very tidy. The apartment contains everything you need for a nice weekend in Stockholm.
1262188,41073496,2015-08-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Karin's flat is well located close to the train station and supermarket open every day. The apartment is comfortable, well equipped, clean, and very bright.
We have spent very nice time and we strongly recommend this place for your stay in Stockholm.
The contact with Karin is very easy, clear and rapid."
647314,109344036,2016-10-21T00:00:00.000Z,The room is really nice and beautiful!
1182616,9816165,2014-01-12T00:00:00.000Z,Peter was extremely nice and helpful. I lost an item on the plane and helped me call various places to help me find it. The place is excellent and the location is very close to Fridhemsplan metro station. Often Peter is not at the apartment so you usually have the place to yourself and the other roommates.
608672,115505562,2016-11-25T00:00:00.000Z,Karl was very welcoming and the place is very cozy with a super comfy bed (great pillows!). It's in a beautiful historic building and in a quiet residential area that is convenient to everything you want to be close to in Stkhlm. The listing didn't indicate that the washer/dryer had to be reserved in advance (it does!) but thankfully Karl and his wife had a reservation for the next morning and he kindly let us use some of that time and helped with using the machines. It would've been nice to have a non-caffeinated tea option (or just anything other than Earl Grey). I didn't mind being able to hear sounds and smells of the kitchen from his flat but the cigarette smell REALLY bothered me. :/
299154,109081525,2016-10-19T00:00:00.000Z,Had a great experience at Daniel's place. Close to everything.
536691,5505851,2013-07-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Very good location. Nice appartment near the subway, near two supermarkets and a nice Italian restaurant and coffeebar/terras on the square below the appartment."
536283,192745761,2017-09-11T00:00:00.000Z,L'appartamento di Paolo è perfetto per visitare la città. A due passi dalla metro e nel carinissimo quartiere di Sofo a Sodermalm. Essenziale e curato. Anche se non abbiamo conosciuto Paolo di persona l'organizzazione e la disponibilità sono state ottime. Lo consiglio assolutamente! Uno degli appartamenti più carini dove sono stata con Airbnb.
556363,76488564,2016-05-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Very nice and spaceful appartement.  A lot of natural light.
Well located.
We enjoyed our stay, I recommend this place if you go to Stockholm!"
1184553,486739767,2019-07-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Perfectly placed in a very nice area with lots of possibilities to eat and shop, transportation nearby. For people who are sensitive to loud noises it might be a bit loud during the night but for us it was absolutely no problem. Very nice host, we got some very good recommendations and the place was very cozy! We would definitely recommend it."
854975,13572413,2014-05-31T00:00:00.000Z,"Sergej's apartment really made for a wonderful stay in Stockholm. The apartment is tidy and has a fully equipped kitchen, shower with great water pressure, black out blinds for the summer sun, and a comfy bed. The bed was a little small for two people so we ended up taking turns sleeping on the couch instead but there are extra blankets and pillows for you to do so. Sergej left us a welcome packet with tips for exploring the city and where to find everything in the apartment and even bought us milk, orange juice, and knackebrod (a typical Swedish breakfast) to make us feel at home. Moreover, the apartment is only 5 minutes walk from the Odenplan metro station and the city bike cards he left for us were a huge plus! I would fully recommend Sergej's place."
795354,454960876,2019-05-19T00:00:00.000Z,Gustav’s place is greatly located in the center of Stockholm. The place is roomy and stylishly decorated. Highly recommended!
819676,141836246,2017-04-05T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment is very well situated, nearby subway and busses although we did everything by foot. The room is perfect, with a very good bed (a bit small for two, but very good and comfortable mantras). Bathroom was spotless. Great place to stay!"
608672,480281045,2019-07-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Ich würde es eher so beschreiben, ein schönes Zimmer in sehr guter Zentraler Lage zum Innenhof, ein Abstellraum in dem es eine Möglichkeit gibt , sich in der Mikrowelle was warm zu machen oder einen Kaffee zuzubereiten. Mehr geht hier wirklich nicht.  Ein kleines Badezimmer mit einer Duscharmatur und einem Abfluss  im Boden und Duschvorhang. Nach dem Duschen steht das komplette Badezimmer unter Wasser , der Boden muss mit Gummiwischern zum Abfluss hin abezogen werden und mit einem Bodentuch getrocknet. werden. Sehr aufwendig, da man hier nicht von einer wirklichen Dusche sprechen kann.  So weit war alles gut , wem die Ausstattung zu einem relativ  normalen Preis genügt nicht viel Ansprüche stellt ist hier richtig. Wer gerne richtig duscht ist hier allerdings falsch."
1248490,63804434,2016-02-27T00:00:00.000Z,The host canceled this reservation 118 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
819676,111684451,2016-11-01T00:00:00.000Z,Fabulous apartment in excellent location - private room and bath are very clean and include every luxury amenity. Hosts are kind and welcoming - highly recommend!

688947,47522978,2015-09-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Minden a legnagyobb rendben ment!  Ez volt az első alkalom, hogy az Airbnb-t vettük igénybe. Jó volt a kommunikáció a bérbeadóval. Tiszta, frissen mosott ágynemű és törölköző várt minket. A szoba egyszerűen berendezett volt, de tiszta és nagyon barátságos.  Nem belváros, de jó volt a közlekedés. Az egyetlen negatívum, hogy a 2. személy egy matracon a földön alszik.
Csak ajánlani tudom minden Stockholmba utazónak."
145320,414330106,2019-02-19T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a wonderful stay in Kim's very centrally located apartment.
Kim was very helpful from the start: Coming with good tips on how to get from the airport to her apartment in the cheapest and fastest way - and furthermore giving us local tips. 
The apartment is clean, nice, with a good kitchen and a very comfortable bed! 
While Stockholm is an expensive city - both for hotels and AirB'n'B - Kim's apartment proved to be of good value. 
We can only recommend other people to stay at Kim's place and be greeted by her hospitality."

Central location, cosy Söder / Slussen with bars, restaurants and shops for those who like that, very close to the tube and then only two stops to Stockholm C and T-centralen.

Andy was a great host, made my stay a breeze. Friendly and welcoming, quick to answer any questions. If you travel alone or with your partner, and you're looking for a central place  from which it's easy to get around I heartily recommend you rent this room."
575371,97875257,2016-08-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Tomas and his family were wonderful hosts. They were so easy going and eager to help us find great things to do in Stockholm. And when one of us got sick, they even cooked us a meal and spent the evening with us! The room was a bit tight but totally private and with easy access to a private bathroom. Everything was very clean. The neighborhood full of local residents going about their business. About 15 minutes to walk to the bridge to Gamla Stan, 5 minutes to the subway, and near to a many other shopping and eating places."

Location is super great and 10 minutes walk to the wonderful old town. Subways and buses 5 minutes walk to easily access. Her house is clean and beautiful, and Bart was so kind to make Taco for us, so nice and we miss her so much. We love Stockholm, and one of the main reason is we met Bart:)"

The owner was friendly and very communicative and provided an excellent set of instructions for the flat and a nice personal guide for the neighborhood and all of Stockholm.

All in all, I would rate this experience very highly and would return again if it was available."

The house is spacious and convenient, with all we need for a week vacation. The beds are very comfortable. The garden is very enjoyable. Its location is also convenient for us to drive to the city for sight-seeing. Walking distance to the water side, grocery, and public transportation. There is also a very charming little design store \"Plan 2\" in the villige, which I would recomment. A big thanks to Dany and Maria!"

Ilona Margareta was very helpful and easy to talk to.  Highly recommended."
164448,318088446,2018-09-03T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a wonderful stay in Li’s apartment. The location is ideal to explore Stockholm by foot as well as hop on many public transit options as needed. The room was clean with two single beds put together to sleep which wasn’t a problem for me and my husband. We shared the bathroom with another girl who was also staying at the apartment during our stay but we never overlapped. 
Li’s extremely nice, she welcomed us with Tea on our first day and gave us a map with highlights of the main sights. 

I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a convenient place to visit Stockholm."

Nous n'avons pas eu la chance de la rencontrer mais elle s'est montrée très flexible au niveau de l'arrivée (23 heures) et a été tres réactive au téléphone.
Son appartement  est tres bien situé, le quartier est agréable, le metro est à 5 mn à pied mais nous avons pu visité toute la ville sans prendre les transports.
La décoration de l'appartement est trés personnel, c'est intéressant et loin du standard triste des chambre d'hotel
l'appartement est tres bien chauffé (important s'il fait -4 dehors) et j'ai rarement dormi dans un lit aussi moelleux !!
un vrai cocoon!!"
581243,475528599,2019-06-24T00:00:00.000Z,Edwin was a great host! I just stayed with him for one night. I was very tired when I arrived and he was very respectful and let me rest. The room is nice and clean with public transport close by.
873383,112881564,2016-11-08T00:00:00.000Z,I can highly recommend staying with Isabelle and her funny cat. The apartment is cozy and the neighborhood is quiet and friendly.

283446,2441548,2012-09-28T00:00:00.000Z,"My stay at Vidhatri's was great!  The whole family is so friendly and generous.  Right away I felt comfortable and welcomed, as I was offered a delicious home cooked vegetarian Indian meal with the family and great conversation. 
 
Regarding the accommodation, everything was very clean and the bed was very comfortable as well.  

The location was convenient to the city center using the metro or bus, and Vidhatri was very helpful about providing exact instructions on how to get to their apartment from the airpor, and anywhere else I wanted to go.  They also called the taxi company for me to reserve a car for my departure to the airport at 4am.

I highly recommend staying with Vidhatri and her family and plan on doing so again when I return to Stockholm in the future."

451155,37279850,2015-07-06T00:00:00.000Z,"It was nice to meet Malin at the house as arranged. She was very friendly and we enjoyed staying in her house. The house is located in a very green suburb - it's almost like being in a forest and we saw a deer and fawn from the kitchen window one morning. However, it is also very convenient within 10 mins walk of the metro and a great supermarket. 
The weather in Stockholm was hot so it was ideal to return from the city centre to relax in the bright, spacious house and garden. All in all, a very comfortable, well-equipped house to stay in."
581243,36174456,2015-06-26T00:00:00.000Z,The house is exactly as described and a perfect place to see and explore Stockholm! Edwin was extremely welcoming and made us feel like the whole place was ours. Everything in the house was convenient and was a lovely walk away from everything. If you stay a few days I suggest the Stockholm pass. We hope to come back some day and will definitely stay here again!!

Hij is meedenkend en een vriendelijke gastheer. De kamer was prima, al bood het bed niet de nachtrust waarop gehoopt was. Door de metalen constructie maakte het bed erg veel lawaai met het draaien in bed. Tomas bood de nachten erna een verblijf in de kamer ernaast aan, waar een beter bed met houten lattenbodem stond."
164448,252777443,2018-04-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Li est une personne charmante, accueillante, disponible (nous sommes arrivés à 2 h du matin et elle nous attendait). Elle est pleine de bons conseils et nous donne tous les renseignements dont nous avons besoin. 
La chambre était située à l’étage de la maison avec un salon et un coin cuisine bien agréable. C’est tout près du centre ville et nous avons tout fait à pied. 
Nous recommandons vivement."

The private room was small, but we could use the complete apartment and often relaxed on the nice chairs in the living room. Kim's kitchen has everything you need to cook meals and we had our own space in the fridge.
The location of the apartment is indeed very central. It was a perfect starting point to explore the city walking or by public transport. Restaurants, bars, and parks can be reached within a few minutes of walking distance."
646635,191156388,2017-09-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Wonderful experience in every way--Kristina's place was great, she was a fantastic host, and I strongly recommend staying if you are in Stockholm."

Ascenseur en panne au moment de la visite, mais aucun pb, on est jeunes et mobiles ! Coretta très réactive et soucieuse du bien-être de ses visiteurs.
Le Super plus : la vie de quartier : beaucoup d'animation, des restos vraiment très sympas tout autour.
Le moins : le lit (s'explique sans doute en grande partie par les standards suédois : 1.20) 
Adresse à retenir !"

Getting to the apartment from the airport was easy. First, I took an airport bus to the city centre (T-centralen) *NOTE- a single ticket is 99SEK if you buy online in advance; 119SEK if you pay on board* Then I took the subway to Karlaplan station, which is 2 stops away from T-centralen. From there, you can walk to his apartment building within 3 minutes. You'll need a key to get access to the building, everything's automatic, safe and convenient! Also, the building is located above a shopping mall. You'll find 2 supermarkets, some restaurants and shops there. 

As for the apartment itself, it was extremely clean and neat. It really felt like home and I enjoyed my stay at Edwin's place. Thank you so much!"
610948,20951148,2014-10-08T00:00:00.000Z,Lina er en svært generøs og sympatisk vert. Det var en glede å leie av henne. Leiligheten er utrolig hyggelig og ligger fantastisk fint til. Oppholdet mitt der kunne ikke ha vært bedre.

As for the appartment, it's a great find. It has a pretty neat location (about 12-15 minutes from the centre by bus). The appartment provides more than enough space for a single person, would be ok for two.

A sidenote: in case you ever end up tired of exploring the city, Carl has an impressive library of books for you to spend an evening with."
1158791,287482341,2018-07-08T00:00:00.000Z,Lovely modern renovation of an elegant and stately apartment. Very conveniently located near the T ban but also walking distance to the downtown along the Kungsholmenstrand.  Quiet and comfortable. Loved it!
556363,75580256,2016-05-22T00:00:00.000Z,"A nice and clean apartment. It is very well located in Stockholm. Right in front of the apartment, there is a metro station. I can really recommend to stay here."
302496,308892544,2018-08-17T00:00:00.000Z,"The location of the apartment was very convenient. It is quite large and spacious however it is not a three bedroom apartment. There is one functioning bedroom that has a closet. The other small room does not have a closet or dresser and there is no place to put your clothes. The third Bedroom is the library which does not have a bed or closet space for clothing. 
My husband and I and a family friend were in Sweden for our daughters wedding. We were all very respectful and cautious with the apartment. So we were stunned to come home to a scathing email accusing us of miscellaneous damages! The owner claimed that we had damaged the window sills by opening the windows but they were certainly damaged and old when we arrived.  There was a horrific heatwave so of course we needed to open windows
She suggested that someone had vomited on her carpet which left us completely speechless! She accused us of breaking a piece of coral in her window sill which we never touched. There are all kinds of knickknacks all over the place and some are in very bad condition.
I would suggest that you do not rent this apartment if you have any intention of using the kitchen. The owner has just installed a marble countertop that is extremely susceptible to damage. We were very cautious using the kitchen but we’re still accused of damaging the countertop.
Also do not invite some of your adult relatives over for dinner as you’ll be accused of being a partier! We are  mid 60s and it’s been quite a long time since we’ve been considered party people. 
So to return from such a special trip And to have this very upsetting email demanding a significant amount of money to repair things that we did not damage and threatening to report to Airbnb that we are horrible people and do not belong in the community.  Over the years we have stayed in many many rental properties and have always had glowing reviews about us as guests."
1204621,76512895,2016-05-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Nettan was a great host and very helpful! The flat is great and the room and bed very comfortable.

Wir waren über Ostern zu Gast in Sofies und Jespers Wohnung und haben uns dort sehr wohl gefühlt. Sie ist ideal für 4 Personen. Wir waren dort mit 3 Erwachsenen und unserem 2-jährigen Sohn. Auch für unseren Mini war alles vorhanden, was benötigt wurde (Kinderbett, Hochstuhl etc.) Die Wohnung ist sehr stilvoll und gemütlich eingerichtet. Innerhalb von 10 Min ist man auf der Haupteinkaufsstraße Stockholms, innerhalb von 25 Min zu Fuß in Stockholms Altstadt. Auch die Anbindung an öffentliche Verkehrsmittel ist optimal. Da die Gastgeber während unseres Besuchs selbst verreist waren, haben wir sie nicht persönlich getroffen. Während der gesamten Zeit hatten wir aber sehr netten Kontakt per (Hidden by Airbnb) und viele tolle Tipps für Stockholm lagen in der Wohnung bereit.

Thanks for a wonderful time in your flat, Sofie & Jesper"

The house is really easy to find and is in a very quiet area yet very close to the centre of Stockholm either by public transport or by driving (if you are used to driving in a major city, Stockholm is no problem). When we arrived, there were deer in the garden; yes this really is a green area. 

We love the use of colour in the house. Breakfast in the fridge was a welcome touch."

His apartment was spotless and centrally located, walkable to most of the main sights of Stockholm. The Karlaplan T-bana station is just a minute walk away, and there is a mall with a supermarket located right below his apartment. Talk about convenient!

El segundo día de estancia, mientras cenábamos en la cocina, nos comunicó que, en aras a la buena armonía de la casa, nos abstuviéramos de hablar entre nosotros dos (mi mujer y yo) porque le molestábamos. Esto nos alarmó y le preguntamos si podíamos hablar normalmente en la habitación y nos contestó que sí que podíamos. Quedamos más tranquilos; a partir de aquel momento 1) nos comunicábamos con susurros, si estábamos en lugares comunitarios y ella estaba en el 
piso, y 2) si estábamos en la habitación, hablábamos normalmente pero con cuidado para no molestarla.

El piso estaba muy limpio y ordenado.

B) La descripción del anuncio era correcta. La habitación grande y confortable, baño correcto i cocina correcto.

C) El barrio nos gusto mucho, tranquilo, céntrico, muy bien conectado por metro y por ferrocarril al aeropuerto"

Public transport to all other areas and attractions is 5-10 mins away. The apartment itself is more a studio set-up than a separate bedroom but is perfect for a couple and is decorated with real personality - a welcoming, cosy and relaxing space.

Emma showed us around and provided bed linen and towels. The apartment is very well kept, clean, lovely furnished and fully equipped with kitchen stuff, WIFI speakers, WIFI and a fantastic balcony on which we had our breakfast every morning in the sun. Emma may ask you to take care for her flowers if you stay around summer. But that was no problem for us because we really felt like being at home. Neighborhood and backyard are very quiet what guarantees you peaceful nights. Emma's adress is easily reachable from Arlanda airport. Just take the \"Flygbussarna\" to Hornstull. From there it's just a 5 minute walk. City-bike and subway station are just around the corner what makes it very easy to explore Stockholm. Emma provided all necessary information about arrival, shopping facilities, things to see and to do in the city. Thank you once again, Emma! :-)"

Its located in Södermalm, a safe and nice area. The stop for the citybus was just around the corner, the subway is only a 10 minutes walk away and there are good resturants, grocery stores and 7/11´s all over the place.

The apartment was clean and had all we needed for a good stay; warm shower, fridge and stove for cooking dinner and a nice livingroom if you just want to relax in the afteroon.

The host, Coretta, made sure me and my girlfriend found the place and met us when we arrived to the apartment and showed us the flat. She was a very good and professional host.

It combines both a quiet stay and an easy access to the surrounding streets that are full of life, with snack bar, bistros and bars to go out in the night. The room was very spacious, sunny and clean, classily decorated with Elizabeth’s taste, with a very nice view of Katarina Bangata STR. The breakfast was very rich, and kept us from eating until the evening. But the biggest advantage of all was the hostess, always cheerful and friendly with a good motivation and a tip for the guests.

The house is well equipped and the room is spacious. So much so, in fact, that I would say the room is the most spacious place in the house! 
The house is the 4 large apartment buildings away from the train station - about 5 minute walk. It is also a 15 minute walk from the Lake. Fantastic Area. Enjoyable stay.

He had provide us information in detail since we arrived at the airport until you can get to the apartment. His apartment is stunning with the size and decoration. The apartment is absolutely clean and smell great. Everything necessaries was provided in the room such as cooking stuffs, towels, and clean sleeping sets.

Paolo is taking very good care in detail of the tenant. For example, he put a lot of leaflets and brochures which very helpful for us people that new in town. Moreover, he has provided a huge iMac to use as well as printer, its very very convenience.

Regard to the location, we truly love the location. Just 5 mins from station. The apartment is locate in the heart of Sodermalm and also surrounded by nice shop and cafe like Acne, Marimekko, Grangpa etc. When I told to my Swedish friend about where I live, she confirmed that  \"Lucky you!, your apartment is pin in exactly right place in the moment, most cool and hip place to visit in stockholm!!\"

So I really recommend Paolo place and I would definitely come back to his place again if I come to Stockholm."

This apt is definitely lived in, and that seems to be what many renters are looking for.  This isn't just a property up for airbnb all year long.

It's only a couple blocks to the subway.  Very nice.  Also, not far from Mariongorget.  It
S one subway stop, and there are cute coffee places and more along the pretty grassy square.  Easily walkable from the apt.

Stockholm was great fun!"

I especially appreciated the fact that the metro station is 5 minutes walk and I could go basically everywhere from there. Unfortunately I haven't met Polina in person but we spoke by messages to arrange my check in and check out and she seems a very nice person and a great host. My arrival was a bit troublesome because I arrived late at night and she was not available at that time, but despite that she accommodated me perfectly and everything went smoothly. A big thumbs up! :)"

Lidia is such a sweet, caring person, always making sure that everyone enjoys staying at her appartment and in Stockholm to the fullest. Definitely opt for the breakfast she prepares every day for her guests, it is delicious and gives you energy for the whole day. We really enjoyed talking with Lidia in the mornings. The room itself is very clean and tidy. The location of the appartment is in a residential area, close to lots of great restaurants, cafes and bars and in one of Stockholm's hippest areas. So, everything is perfect!"
647314,508090652,2019-08-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Mallika is an artist who has a natural taste for home decor. The whole house, and especially the bedroom, were very clean, cozy and beautiful. Something that makes your stay even better are the details. There were tea, sugar, hot water dispenser, glasses of fresh water, cards for the subway and tips for differents restaurants into the bedroom when we arrived. Also, she has two lovely cats. We strongly recommend her place."
1158791,307767289,2018-08-15T00:00:00.000Z,"We (family of four) stayed a couple of days at this great apartment. Alex is very responsive and both check in and check out was very flexible and smooth. The apartment is very nice with everything you may need (4th floor with elevator). Nicely furnished, fully equipped kitchen and nice little balcony towards the backyard. Our two kids slept in the small room on extra beds, absolutely fine for the stay. The main sleeping room is very big and goes towards the street, but its very calm (esp. as 4th floor). The area is very nice, close to the water, shopping and dining. Would definitely come me back. Thanks for a great stay!"

Very accomodating, well heated and equipped with complimentary coffee/tea. Cozy apartment for 1-2 persons. Karl answered had excellent english (helpful for we are Australian and spoke next to no Swedish!) all of our questions about the area and Stockholm itself, also provided us with a map. In a great location so close to shops and walking distance to Gamla Stan, and the building is with lift. Would recommend!"

I can't say enough about the location, it was absolutely perfect, with the subway right around the corner, and old town just a few blocks away, it made for a great trip with short travel times. The flat easily accommodated 3 adults, and was very cozy and comfy. I would recommend this place to everyone!"

Her home is conveniently located south of the city center, about 30 min by bus. There is a beautiful lake with hiking trails nearby (15 min walk) as well as a supermarket and other shops (10 min walk). If you like to cycle, the ride into town is very nice as well. All in all, a great location for exploring Stockholm and the surrounding area. Enjoy your travels!"

It has a good view to a lovely park just across the street. The building has good security too. Her pets won't disturb you if you stay in the studio. A big supermarket is just two blocks away, on a street full of coffee shops, restaurants, and other shops. Metro is just 10-min-walk  away, and with 10 more minutes you can arrive at the old town (Gamla Stan). I would recommend Ilona's studio to anyone who wants to visit Stockholm for more than just one or two days."

It is also well communicated by public transport (in fact, the metro station is in front of the flat) and very close to the downtown (5 minutes walk). Every room of the flat is absolutely clean and the kitchen is amazing, you can use any tool or device you want. 

Edwin is really kind and helpful as well. He gave us good information about the city, museums, transportation... He speaks Swedish, English, Spanish and Russian. He let you feel utterly free inside the flat. 

Very good experience. Don't hesitate to be hosted by Edwin!"

Naapurusto on rauhallinen. Davidin kanssa asioiden hoitaminen on helppoa, ja hän myös tarjosi nopeasti apua erinäisten lisätarpeidemme kanssa. Asunto on tyylikäs ja rento, ja siinä oli mukava asua neljän yön ajan."

Wow, that would barely cover just what a fabulous time we had in our Stockholm home. There were six of us, 4 adults (2 couples) and two teens (female) that stayed in the home for 9 days. We had plenty of room for all us. Private rooms for each couple and the two teens. Plenty of bathroom and shower space. We spent a lot of time in the kitchen as most families do, but everything we needed was available. The home included laundry facilities, kitchen ware, towels, BBQ grill, cable TV, apple TV, and plenty of living space for everyone to spread out. The home felt cozy and warm and it was perfect. The bus station is a 5 min walk, with service to the nearby metro station. The metro station is a 10 min walk. Two grocery stores are within 10 min walk in either direction. The host was awesome! He kept in touch weeks prior to our trip providing information about Stockholm and some great sites to visit as well as weather. The host met us the metro station and walked us to the home. Upon arrival we received a tour of the home, a set of keys, an instructions page on the home, and various visitor maps. It felt like we had been long-life friends- it was a great welcome. The listing description was right on and so much more! The neighborhood was fabulous and very safe, very much a middle-class area. We walked many evenings from the various metro stations and bus stations surrounding the home, as well as to and from the grocery stores. We highly recommend this home for anyone staying in Stockholm. It was great staying in a suburb area and riding the metro into the city each day. It was an escape from the hustle and bustle of the city people traffic."

It is a perfect base for everyone who wants to be in the middle of what Hornstull has to offer (Langholmen Bad, kayak, Hornstull Marknad, hip restaurants at bars around Hornstullgatan). It is all within 3-5 minutes walking distance, while the apartment itself is in quiet street. Communication with Klara was always easy and pleasant."
647314,12224949,2014-04-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Mallika is a very easy going, sociable host.  She immediately made me (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication was very clear and responsive to changes of schedule - I appreciated that. Mallika even invited me to join her and friends at a local small scale music scene so I got a nice taste of the alternative side of Stockholm - the Södermalm that tourists wouldn't normally see.  I liked that a lot.

The apartment is pretty small which wasn't an issue for me because I had the lovely big and bright bedroom - very comfy.  The great thing about this apartment is that it is genuine old style Stockholm city blocks with very interesting \"quartier\" life all around.  You are so close (like 2 minutes walk either way) to either the T-Bana or the Pendeltag - you can whizz off anywhere you like within minutes or you can even walk into town if you want on a fine day."

610948,12901184,2014-05-13T00:00:00.000Z,"An absolutely fantastic place to stay in Stockholm! The flat is literally in the heart of the city. Out of the kitchen window - enjoy the picturesque view of the town during the breakfast and in the evening the fabulous sun-set before you head out for drinks in bars or restaurants or the old town. The old town is within 10-15 minutes walk. If you are too tired to walk then jump onto the sub which is abt 2 minutes away from the flat. All convinience stores are within very short walking distance. Same is true for boutiques, shops and cafés. 

Lina is a perfect host: she is prompt in responding to any queries and has prepared a booklet with very nice recommendations. Would I go to Lina's place again? Oh yes!"

Even though the location is already expected not in the downtown area, it was walkable to the metro/subway and to supermarket as well. Having a lot of funs at the yard to play snow and interactions between some kids living nearby. Overall, great value and money."

The studio itself is exactly how it looks like on the pictures. With a very comfortable bed, sheets and towels, TV, wireless internet connection etc. Perfect for a short or long stay in Stockholm (I stayed for 8 weeks). Located near Mariatorget on Södermalm you have access to the red metro line and different busses for transport in the city.
I definitely recommend staying at Annika's place - you will love it!"

Vi hade en bra mejlkontakt med ägaren Jenny innan och efter bokningen av lägenheten. Hela ägarfamiljen mycket trevlig och hjälpsam. De tog emot gästerna när de anlände och gav information om lägenheten och dess omgivningar, kommunikationer m.m.

Lägenheten är en \"levande lägenhet\" där folk bor! Den är modern, ljus och ganska stor, ren och fin och bra utrustad. Modern lägenhet i ett nytt område, nära Stockholms innerstad. Ganska stor och mycket trevlig balkong. Närheten till vatten gör lägenheten mycket attraktiv. Sammanfattningsvis allt mycket bra!"

Located away from the tourist areas, yet only 2 blocks front the underground metro that apartment was in an ideal location.  The Airbnb photos do not do the apartment justice.  The space is ample and spotless.  The bed is comfortable and the bathroom is modern.  The kitchenette does the job and the apartment contains every element to make a visit enjoyable ranging from a loner umbrella to extra power plugs.  Mikael greeted us upon arrival, offered a thorough orientation to the city, and gave spot on recommendations for sightseeing and eating.  I cannot imagine a better place to stay while visiting this beautiful city."

The apartment is perfect from many (Website hidden by Airbnb) a 4 minute walk to the T-bana and is a 10 minute ride to Gamla Stan and Centralen.  I actually enjoyed take the # 4 bus, which is short walk as well.  The apartment is very comfortable, nice furnishings, dishwasher, good wi-fi, cable tv with many English speaking stations and a washer/dryer in the basement.  The only concern for Americans would be the very small bathroom.  I was fine with it but some of my compatriots are used to big luxurious bathrooms.  If that's you, Sweden isn't the country for you.  I met many locals who told me the small bathroom in the apartment is typical to most Swedish apartments.  Honestly, for a week, it wasn't a problem for me whatsoever.  I highly recommend this apartment.  You will love it and will be made to feel at home by the lovely host."

Petit conseil pour l'aller et le retour de l'aéroport Arlanda, avec la carte de transport SL 7 jours (300 couronnes pour les +65 ans) achetée au comptoir Informations de l’aéroport, nous avons pris le bus 583 (à droite en sortant du terminal 2) jusqu'à la gare de Märsta puis le train Pendeltåg qui arrive direct à 3 minutes de chez Lidia, c'est un peu plus long (55mn) que le train Express 20 mn pour le centre ville + 15 mn pour arriver chez Lidia) mais beaucoup plus économique. Notre carte SL a été amortie en 48h.
Temps superbe, ciel bleu pas un nuage pendant 6 jours, très beau souvenirs de Stockholm."
1153177,182565846,2017-08-15T00:00:00.000Z,"What a unique & eclectic apartment. Located in a beautiful part of town. With the two outside balconies you could enjoy the morning & afternoon sunshine. Plus having both front & back doors open provided a wonderful cross breeze. We highly recommend this place to stay if you are traveling to Stockholm. Our host greeted us upon our arrival and provided lunch. After traveling 13+ hours it was a welcoming sight. Thank you Terry! Sincerely, Lynne Hamilton"

581243,519731105,2019-08-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin's home was a nice place in a quiet neighborhood, a short train ride to the city. Public transit was super easy and you could probably walk as well. It's located right above a mall/supermarket with lots of options for dining and shopping. Edwin was hospitable and his home was a great value for our quick trip to Stockholm."
897584,254258945,2018-04-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Una casa y amfitriona encantadoras. El apartamento es súper estiloso y desde la ventana se pueden ver diversos animales. Nosotras tuvimos la suerte de ver un cervatillo, liebres y una ardilla. Está un poco más alejado del centro de lo que nos imaginábamos, pero aún así muy bien comunicado. Recomiendo totalmente"
1212891,5969709,2013-07-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud is the best host you can imagine. She gave me a very warm welcome and made me feel at home. The room is cozy and clean, so is the whole appartment. And the two cats are really cute! Infrastructure is excellent and the sea is very near. I sure will come back again and can only recommend Maud to you all!"
1124388,81412873,2016-06-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Very good stay, Carl gave me a clear explanation to reach the apartment from the airport. The apartment was clean and nice . Thank you"

1035775,86026747,2016-07-14T00:00:00.000Z,I would highly recommend Magnus' apartment! It was conveniently located and immaculately clean.  Magnus was impeccable with his communication and was awaiting us when we arrived from the airport.  I would stay there again when I return to Stockholm.
1124388,73729299,2016-05-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Carl was a delightful host. He was so helpful in explaining different ways to get to his flat and the costs and routes involved. He was waiting for us with a welcome drink and was generous with his time and answered all our questions to orient us to a weekend in Stockholm.  
The flat is light and we found it had everything we needed in a charming student- like style, including an eclectic range of books and music. We did not cook bigger meals but everything was available to do so. Showers hot and very efficient.
The flat is on a pretty little island just a 12min bus ride from the central station. Very frequent bus service. There are several choices for eating out within a few steps of the flat, as well as a very good convenience store on the corner."
873383,176996394,2017-08-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Isabelle is really nice and ready to help when needed. Cozy apartment with easy access to metro station, good grocery store( with cheaper price), lovely and hospital cats( say hi and goodbye at door), quiet neighborhood, heartfelt conversations, forgiving character(our careless mistake☺️)... highly recommended ...hope to revisit Stockholm someday"
1182616,14235997,2014-06-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Our host was very friendly, thoughtful, and well organized.  The bed is super comfortable, and it was a  pleasure to sit on the balcony."
1212891,108524500,2016-10-16T00:00:00.000Z,Fantastiс Apartments !) Fantastiс Maud!!!apartments are very clean. welcoming hostess. wonderful cat. I was thrilled. I recommend these apartments!
1204621,181682705,2017-08-13T00:00:00.000Z,Nettan was fairly courteous and helpful with navigating around the Stockholm area.
299154,400938925,2019-01-13T00:00:00.000Z,Nice place and Daniel is very responsive which is great. Location is near construction of the new highway so it’s a bit tough to get to and from while all that is happening.
723539,6363366,2013-08-10T00:00:00.000Z,"I spent 12 days on Mathias Apartment in August with my partner and child. Stockholm is a wonderful place to visit and we enjoyed a lot our stay in the city. The apartment is perfectly located and you can just walk everywhere in the city. We only had to take a bus one day because it was raining a lot! 
Mathias was very gentile and provided a travel baby cot for our child. 
Generally speaking, the apartment was correct when we entered, but when you have a baby everything needs to be just perfect so we had to spend some time cleaning some parts of the house just after our arrival and we found some perishable food in the fridge that we had to get rid of.  The kitchen was tiny but we managed to prepare everyday meals on it. 
There was no space in any closet to put our clothes and it was not comfortable for us to have all our stuff and the baby’s distributed over the furniture.
We did our best to leave the house perfectly clean as we leave even if we didn’t found any brush and the vacuum machine didn’t work very well. The linen and towels provided were ok for a shorter stay. In our case, we had to wash them because there was no replacement. 
I do recommend this apartment but may be for shorter stays."
1139359,178312268,2017-08-05T00:00:00.000Z,Very nice place would recommend.
478105,4822889,2013-05-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Christian's apartment is great. Bright, spacious, modern, pretty, and in a nice neighbourhood, with some cool bars and restaurants. Touristy Stockholm isn't within walking distance, but is no distance at all by metro, and the metro station's very close. Two of them are very close, actually - one of them, a 4 to 5 minute walk through some really pretty forest. The sun was shining when I was there, and I loved that little walk.

Above all though, if you stay here, you get the benefit of Christian, who is a phonecall away, an awesome guy, and knows absolutely everyone and everything there is to know about Stockholm.

I've been to Stockholm a few times, but never have I had as much fun as this time, and that's purely because of his knowledge and advice on where to go and what to do (if you want it) - and in a place where fashions change as fast as Stockholm, that's worth knowing. 

Really would recommend it...

Cheers,

Tom"
819676,279225428,2018-06-20T00:00:00.000Z,Great place and location. Highly recommend staying here
700113,14191945,2014-06-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Ilona was a very friendly host, kind and easy going, and her small appartment was perfect. I was on a research visit to KTH (the university of technology) wich was just a 15 min walk from there. A bit noisy during night since there is a road passing by just outside, but not to bad, and if you want to stay central this is very often the case. Ilonas dogs will not make any fuzz, at least I did not even notice them appart from when we met in the hallway :). Thus, highly recommended!"
1261445,16825858,2014-08-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Marie-Louise is an excellent host; she welcomed us (along with her grown-up daughter) to the apartment and we just chatted informally until we knew everything we needed to. The apartment is compact and the space is cleverly designed to be comfortable and to function well. 

I chose the location carefully as I wanted us to be able to swim whenever we wanted but also to have easy access to the rest of Sodermalm and the city centre. I had no experience of the Hornstull neighbourhood so that was a really pleasant surprise, with its casual restaurants, excellent breakfast venues and the added bonus of a floating bar/restaurant on the Strand - all conveniently close to the T-ban station.

My partner and I would stay in the apartment again without hesitation."
1189469,41433671,2015-08-07T00:00:00.000Z,"An absolutely wonderful, modern, comfortable, beautifully furnished and roomy apartment - all directions to get there and get in clear and really very central - you can walk into town easily from here. As a family of four we felt it was very spaciou and loved our time here - would really reccomend."
313195,4540882,2013-05-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Perfect and cosy apartment with kitchen, laundry, internet and everything in a nice neigborhood! we had a very nice stay!"
1153177,315999434,2018-08-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Incredible!  The best location in Ostermalm, walk to bakery, grocery, the T station, parks, everything.  Huge apartment for this location.  Our family of 4 was very comfortable and Terry was quick to communicate.  Highly recommended."
900043,74230163,2016-05-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Lejligheden er præcis som på billederne. Der var rent og hyggeligt, og der var lagt sengetøj og håndklæder frem. Ligeledes var der en fin guide til at finde skraldespande og vaskemuligheder i kælderen.
Køkkenet er lille, men der er alt hvad man skal bruge.
Udlevering og aflevering af nøgle foregik nemt og bekvemt.
Selve beliggenheden var helt perfekt. Lige ved siden af en T-bana-station med shoppingcenter og supermarked og stoppested for bussen til lufthavnen. Jeg vil helt klart anbefale denne lejlighed til andre :)"
647314,31295148,2015-05-04T00:00:00.000Z,"I can't say enough good things.  This was my first time using Airbnb, as well as my first time in Stockholm, and I am now an enthusiastic fan of both.  Mallika was the perfect host!  She is kind and thoughtful and knows the city well, so she gives great recommendations.  The restaurant she suggested served possibly the best meal of my life (\"The Blue Door,\" but in Swedish - everyone in Stockholm speaks perfect English, so I never practiced my Swedish!) 

The room was better than the photos.  Her whole house is cute, but this room is like a little oasis.   Plus the neighborhood is great.  Because of this trip, I am now a proud fan of the following:

1) Stockholm
2) Airbnb
3) Mallika
4) Swedish men
5) Herring"
1184553,161479806,2017-06-18T00:00:00.000Z,Annbritt's listing in Stockholm was great. Room is accurately described and in a great location that is convenient for walks to Gamla Stan and is located in a very trendy area. Would stay again.
478105,14739404,2014-06-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Christian was a welcoming host with detailed instructions on virtually everything - in the home and how to use all the appliances, etc., plus location  of easily accessable stores and restaurants in the area and very good instructions for transit on 2 convenient subway lines plus buses. The area is safe, quiet and very clean. The home is very artistic and interesting. We enjoyed our stay."
530454,510761499,2019-08-16T00:00:00.000Z,Great locations. Points of view we would not find on our own. Pleasant time and great photos.

Feels like paradise!"
1271843,101995071,2016-09-16T00:00:00.000Z,"What a fantastic experience! I spent two nights in Stockholm as part of a two week Europe trip, and this was definitely the highlight! The apartment is wonderfully decorated and in a perfect location. It was easy to access from the airport via the trains. Once I arrived, I explored the city on foot after discussing recommendations with the host, Johanna (Andre's girlfriend). She even met me one evening and showed me some really cool parts of the city. I will definitely stay here again on my next trip!"
608672,4742728,2013-05-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Cet appartement est très bien placé et propre.
L'hôte Karl est accueillant et sympa, il parle le français.
Le seul bémol dont nous ferons part est la douche dont l'utilisation n'est pas du tout pratique, il faudra absolument que ce système soit réadapté, nous avons failli nous noyer, mais nous avons bien ri...."
1158893,29326208,2015-04-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Vi følte oss hjemme og godt mottatt med en gang, og Maria og Dany hadde pyntet fint til påsken vi skulle tilbringe i påsken. Huset er minst like fint som på bildene - nesten finere egentlig. Alt var bra, både soverommene, kjøkkenet, tv stua og stua nede. Det var greit å komme til t bane og inn til Stockholm. Været var veldig skiftende så utemøblene og Hagen ble ikke brukt. Vi kommer gjerne hjem igjen om sommeren en gang. Stickholm er en utrolig hyggelig by. Vi møtte ikke Dany men alt fungerte perfekt ved ankomst og under oppholdet. Vi var 2 voksne og 4 barn i alderen 6 år til 16 år."
1137050,19789473,2014-09-18T00:00:00.000Z,"What a beautiful appartement! We had a absolutely perfect stay there. It is really good located, quiet, but still close to nice cafés and restaurants. We were walking distance from everything. Gabriel was the perfect host and kept in contact with us to make sure we were all set and he gives his opinion of the places he thinks visitors would enjoy, even my next city Copenhagen. If you come to Stockholm and need a place to stay, I highly recommend you consider Gabriel's apartment. You won't regret it."
299154,20361276,2014-09-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Fin plassering. 
Vi var fire gæster og der var gode sovepladser til alle. 
Lejligheden er lidt lille men passede fint til vores behov. 
Vi måtte ændre planer på ankomstdagen, men Daniel var fleksibel så alt løste sig uden problemer. Daniel tilbød at vise os området, men vi klarede os på egen hånd."
242188,107610371,2016-10-11T00:00:00.000Z,Lidia welcomed me to her home and gave extremely clear directions for how to get there!  She also provided me with lots of ideas for what to do while I was in Stockholm!
1173290,35650068,2015-06-21T00:00:00.000Z,We were made to feel so welcome and our host spent time with us after we arrived telling us about the local area and also about the best way to travel around stockholm. We felt very much at home in the appartment which is very spacious.  The appartment is in a great location with a train station and local buses just 5 minutes walk from the appartment.  If we were to go back to Stockholm again we would have no hesitation in staying there again.
776155,30571929,2015-04-24T00:00:00.000Z,I had the chance to stay in Ann-Sofie's beautiful apartment in city center of Stockholm. Everything went really smooth all the way from the day that I requested to stay in the apartment until the day I left. I can highly recommend this apartment!

The apartment is a delight, the room is big, comfortable, absolutely clean; and extremely quiet both at night and during daytime; the breakfast was delicious, and had us not being hungry again until dinner time.
And the neighbourhood as well is awesome. Lots of shops, restaurants, bus and metro stations \"just around the corner\", and the very center of the city easily reachable even by foot, in just about 20 minutes.
I highly recommend staying here!!"

He was very welcoming, when I arrived he even get me the breakfast for the next day, maps, information, cards for metro,bus and bike, even simcards. He really went above and beyond to accommodate me. 
Thanks for everything."
954832,9040986,2013-12-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Mikael is a great host, willing and kind. He helped us out with transport, sightseeing and shopping, by giving us city maps, booklets  and a lot of tips. The apartment is clean and perfectly suitable for two people. Plus, there is a heated floor in the bathroom, which is very comfortable in winter. The area is full of shops, bakeries and supermarkets. The metro station is just 2 min walk while the bus stop to and from Arlanda airport is 8-10 min walk. That made my stay in Stockholm really convenient and pleasant."
206221,1980525,2012-08-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Elisabeth is a delightful hostess. Does everything possible to make its guests feel at home. I felt like an old friend on a visit. The house is close to the metro and in a nice area with many bars and restaurants. The breakfast is rich and the room like the one in your home. You share the bathroom with her, but Elisabeth is very discreet. If I returned to Stockholm no doubt still go to her"
299154,6881201,2013-08-28T00:00:00.000Z,I had a great stay at Daniel's apartment in Stockholm. The location couldn't be better...very close to Gamla Stan and all the action of Södermalm. The bed was comfy and having the balcony there for a meal outside was nice. Daniel was very friendly and made sure all of my questions were answered. I definitely recommend his apartment for an individual or small group visiting this beautiful city.

It has all the necessary things required for a comfortable stay. Lina is an very nice host. She was there to welcome me with her neat apartment. She was always in touch with me though on vacation and ensured I had a comfortable stay. She had a list to good to visit places around as well as some recommended resturants. Her collection of books on travel and living is awesome. Will recommend her house to all."

875505,352444061,2018-11-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Freja's place is a really great, centrally located place in Stockholm. It's super central; but on a nice quiet street. Best of both worlds of easy access to everything, but being able to get rest when you need it.

The apt is nice and sunny, while the building is new and in good shape. There are a million great coffee shops nearby, and the subway stops are super close too.

Freja, herself, is very knowledgeable about the city, and a great communicator. In short, I highly recommend this place!"

1153177,521884506,2019-09-01T00:00:00.000Z,Terry was great to deal with. The apartment was clean and in a great location. Not enough storage space for our clothes. The beds and pillows were not very comfortable but that can be common in Sweden. And the shower water leaks over half the bathroom floor but again common in Sweden. Overall it is good place.
1158893,368545165,2019-01-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Dany was very helpful, the house is in a very calm and poshy neighbourhood (we even spotted 2 deers) and well connected to the city center.  The house has everything you need, from garden, parking places on premises, to sauna and other features."

Karin, værten, var utrolig flink og hjælpsom. Vi kan sagtens anbefale den til andre hvis man skal besøge Stockholm.
Vi var 2 voksne og 2 teenager børn og der var rigeligt med plads.
Tak for det.

The location is amazing! Super close to the metro station (only a couple of minutes on foot), very central, and in a nice neighborhood. 
The apartment is lovely, very clean, stylish, cozy and welcoming, and the room has everything you would need. I was pleasantly surprised as it was even better than it looked in the pictures.  
I would definitely recommend this place, and if I go back to Stockholm I wouldn't hesitate to stay with Nic and Usha again.
Thank you for everything :)"
526170,1798640,2012-07-25T00:00:00.000Z,"This apartment was perfect for our family of 4: 2 adults, 3 year old, and baby. The master bedroom was well outfitted with crib, cradle, and changing table, and the toddler's room was well stocked with toys. Our boys so appreciated playing with all the toys! The location was very nice - easy walking distance to park, playground, wading pool, grocery store, pizza, and sushi. Beds and couch were comfortable, and the kitchen had everything we needed. The laundry facilities on the main floor of the building worked well for us, and we washed a lot of clothes over 3 weeks! Would definitely recommend."

Дэниел быстренько показал что где и предоставил нас самим себе, но предложил обращаться к нему с вопросами по любым поводам. В квартиры был хороший WiFi, а также путеводители и распечатки с описанием мест вокруг. Последнее оказалось довольно удобным."

536691,18873024,2014-09-02T00:00:00.000Z,"The appartment is great and very well situated in Södermalm. There are nice bistro, restaurants and supermarket at walking distance. There is a the subway station nearby too.
We never met Cecilia but she provided us all the necessary information.
The neighbourhood is a little noisy at night. The appartment was clean and comfortable, especially the kitchen.
We recommend this accomodation if you want to experiment the Stockholm people life!"

299154,36267332,2015-06-27T00:00:00.000Z,"We were so lucky to have Daniel's appartement be our first AirBnb experience; what a great start. Daniel was so fast at answering our request to stay in the apartment, our questions in advance and messages while we were in the apartment. Such a nice, funny and good guy.

The apartment is brilliantly layed out and decorated. So cleverly done and bigger than I thought from the photo. Other then that it looks exactly as the photos. Clean and cosy made us feel at home right away. Real character. BIG nice TV and a threat to have Netflix :) Nice soft bed.

The location is PERFECT. I twisted my ankle the week before we went, so it was so good to be able to quickly get back home for a little rest before going out again for more experiences. Lots of nice shops in the neighbourhood, very short to the subway/bus etc. and very good to have the opportunity to go outside on the balcony. 

We are all ready planning our next trip :) Maybe just before Christmas, I can imagine Gamla Stan must be such a wonderland then. Perfect place for romantic walks in the summer too."

Todo está muy limpio. Para mí el único detalle sería especificar muy bien que en el mismo espacio que hay para moverse en el baño es en donde te bañas. Eso quizá hubiera hecho que yo cambiara mi elección de lugar pero puede no ser tan relevante para las demás personas. 
Por lo demás, el lugar es excelente!"
1153177,514878384,2019-08-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Our wonderful stay in Terry’s apartment began upon check in.  Terry was graciously flexible in meeting us later than we expected due to unplanned changes to our travel itinerary.  When we eventually arrived, Terry was warm and engaging and had prepared a delicious meal for the four of us!  The apartment is in a great location within walking distance of most of the things we wanted to do, and there is a T-Bana station just a couple of blocks away that we used when walking was not the best option.  The check in and check out process was easy and uncomplicated, and the apartment’s amenities were perfect for our needs.  Terry was additionally always timely with his communications, and offered helpful advice.  I would definitively stay here again, and highly recommend Terry’s apartment to others."

916806,32945347,2015-05-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Pros-A very nice and clean place to stay, feels very safe also. Mansour was very easy to communicate with even with our last minute booking. Lots of nearby places to buy supplies, very very good view and close to nature

Cons- a good 30 minutes by walk+ train to the city, if you miss the last bus during the evening you would have to walk back and it could be hard with some steep climbs and cold weather. 

Overall, would return and recommend to others :)"
1158893,177200477,2017-08-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Dany's house is a perfect base to explore Stockholm for a family or group. Short trip on tunnelbana takes you to all places of interest and station only about 1km from house.
Dany is an incredibly helpful and generous host, providing loads of information and making check in very easy. 
House is spacious and well equipped. Lovely garden area to sit out.
I would definitely recommend Dany as a host and his house for your trip to Stockholm."

242188,44897370,2015-08-30T00:00:00.000Z,"The room was as good as I had expected and Lidia as nice as I had hoped. The location is great, it is very easy to get into town, only a few minutes away from public transport and close enough to the center to walk there. It is quiet at night and I felt like coming home after long days walking around Stockholm. 
Having read previous reviews, I also decided to book breakfast which was a good idea.
It was my first airbnb-experience but hopefully not my last and should I come back to Stockholm, I am sure to try and stay with Lidia again. It is great to be able to travel this way as a 60+ person and also great to have a 60+ host as welcoming and interesting as Lidia. Thanks a lot, Lidia."

The location is good, but note that with a late arrival (after 23:30) a direct connection from Arlanda by train is not possible. Room is rather small but has everything you need, and the bathroom is large. Reccomended."

His place is only two Train station from the central station and his apartment is only about 30 m away from the station. Additionally there is a small shopping mall right on the buttom of the building. So there is just anything that you need. Furthermore there is a lovely park nearby. I would highly recommend to stay at Edwin. My boyfriend and I would always come back to his place if we ever go to Stockholm again!!

Thanks again Edwin!"

900043,258973479,2018-04-30T00:00:00.000Z,"What an amazing place. Small, but very cozy. Decorated nicely. Had tea and a kettle so we enjoyed nice cuppas in the mornings. Christin was a lovely host and communicated with us so well. We loved the location of this place. It was a 3 minute walk to the subway station which led us to everywhere in Stockholm we wanted to go to. Gamla Stan was a total gem. Absolutely loved it there!! Christin recommended eating at Ramblas Tapas, which was a very short walk from her Air B&B. What an AMAZING restaurant. We loved Sweden, and for our first time visiting, it couldn’t have been any more perfect. Special thanks to Christin with her lovely flat!"

739726,13212597,2014-05-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Sanna is very personable.  When you first meet her, it feels like you have already known her for years.  She clearly, and understandably, loves her city and the neighborhood.  She is very easy to talk to and feel comfortable with, and gave us helpful tips on places nearby we might like to visit, such as restaurants, coffee shops, and grocery stores. Very nice lady.

The listing exceeded our expectations.  Primarily we came as tourists, expecting to do a lot of sight-seeing, while still keeping in mind that we'd like to experience Stockholm from a resident's point of view.  However because of our jet lag, we relied on the apartment more than originally anticipated.  It was clean, organized, comfortable, and functional.  All you need to do is go to ICA (be sure to try the smoked salmon, they can cut for you at the deli).  You will have just about everything you need to be comfortable.
 
This location was perfect because it is the part of town that is only 3 stops from the city center.  We were there for only 3 days and got a 72 hour pass to use the transit system at the airport.  So, we needed to see as much as possible in a very short amount of time.  Although we could have walked to just about everywhere, the pass helped us save time in a few cases.

With our pass, we could travel very easily all over the city.  We particularly like the location because it is a little bit out of the way of old town (and other tourists).  We could walk to the main street for all our basic needs, and even get an idea of how it would feel to live there, since we lived among the locals.  But when we were out being tourists, we had very easy access to all the main points of interest.  If you're planning to rely on the transit system, I highly recommend getting a transit pass. Also if you plan to spend your time in Stockholm, it seems like it would be difficult to navigate using a car.

In late May, there's a lot of daylight.  We're visiting from San Francisco and this neighborhood felt very safe to us.  In Sanna's neighborhood, most of the residents were young professionals.  There are some similarities between San Francisco and Stockholm.  You have to watch out for bicyclists, but they seem more organized than the ones in San Francisco."
1212891,10479891,2014-02-21T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a great time in Stockholm staying in Maud's room. 
The room is very clean and organized. We found in there everything we needed for a perfect stay. Clean towels, bottle of water and glasses, the wi-fi password (very important), maps, and a nice view for a park!
Maud and her two cats were a warm hosts, and she explained to us all about the main sights of Stockholm.
We used the kitchen every evening for dinner. It has all you need to prepare a meal. She also kept a shelf in her fridge for us to put our stuff.
Overall it was a great experience. It was our first Airbnb experience and I definitely gonna do it again. I strongly recommend Maud's place for a stay in Stockholm."
242188,14914206,2014-06-29T00:00:00.000Z,I stayed 2 nights in Lidia's house. Everything was perfect and Lidia was such a thoughtful lady just like my grandma. The breakfast was lovely and her place was so easy to access any place. I will recommend her place with confidence!!!

A clean, tidy, well furnished and warm 3 bedroom apartment which was a pleasure to come home to at the end of the day.

Unfortunately the first night we arrived, Carl was not able to meet us because he was stuck in another city. He was very accommodating and helped us find a hotel. The second night we were able to stay at the Cosy apartment listed here.

Although our stay in Stockholm started off a bit rocky, it completed nicely and without any further incidents.

Carl's flat is compact and the bed mattress is flush up against the walls. Although very cozy, there is still plenty of room for two people to prepare a snack in the kitchen, eat in the living room, and sit on the shared balcony (which you access via the attic)."

Was a perfect place for my colleagues and I to stay while attending a meeting at Stockholm University.  Easily accommodates the number of people advertised.  Well-stocked kitchen, plenty of towels and linen, and balconies that we would have used if not for the brisk weather.

As a great bonus, an awesome bakery is located less than a block away--check out their sublime cardamom rolls (\"mumma\" I think they are called).  A modestly-sized grocery store is also very nearby."

Gabriella was a fantastic host! Checked in with us before we arrived to see if we needed help with anything, lent us her Metro card, gave us some great dinner ideas and even filled the fridge with delicious breakfast treats!!

A true Airbnb experience!"
608672,10846631,2014-03-10T00:00:00.000Z,Perfect place to be when exploring Stockholm. Karl was very flexible on check in. He was very accomodating and extremely friendly without overstepping any boundries. Highly recommended from me. I will probably stay there if I need in-town accomodation again. Tack.
1250227,43223130,2015-08-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Listing was as expected. Per was a helpful host.
The location was wonderful. Close to everything. Grocery store within
1-2 min. walk. Closest restaurant 2 min. away with many more within
walking distance.
We walked all over Stockholm. What a beautiful city!
I would stay there again if available.
WiFi was not available in the apt. but most cafes and restaurants
provided a connection. The basic four TV channels in Sweden was available.
One important issue to mention: Many people, myself included,
are allergic to down and duck feathers and I had a problem there.
We were able to do something about it ourselves, however Per
was very kind and would have done something about it had he known.
(Didn't tell him until we called to say goodbye and thank you).
We usually stay in hotels so this Airbnb was wonderful. Having a kitchen and access to laundry makes it very convenient during longer stays. 
We were there for 32-33 days."
755843,67535759,2016-03-30T00:00:00.000Z,"We stay very comfortable, the apartment is in a perfect ubication, a quite neighborhood and close to the city center and fully equipped. Pär is also a perfect host, he helped us to reach to the apartment and he offered us a warm wellcome. Thank you for everything, we enjoyed our visit to Stockholm ;)"
1124388,5837995,2013-07-18T00:00:00.000Z,"This is a great little apartment on a beautiful island in Stockholm. I have lived in a few different places around the city and this was my favorite. It is a peaceful spot that isn't far outside of the city. The apartment itself has everything you need and the breakfast foods were a nice touch that not many AirBnB hosts throw in. Definitely appreciated. This is a great spot to base your Stockholm adventures out of. You can tour the city, and when you return home you won't feel bad spending lazy time close to home on this super peaceful island."
164448,49954619,2015-10-07T00:00:00.000Z,Lidia is a great host and ideal if you consider walking around Södermalm and Gamla Stan. She gave us a warm welcome with some coffee/tea and a quick but valuable overview about Stockholm. Beds and bathroom are clean and the pictures of them are accurate. WiFi was a bit lagging sometimes but this might not be Lidias fault. Would recommend!
1054406,185734294,2017-08-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Margaret et Thomas sont les hôtes parfait. Ils se plient en 4 pour nous aider et sont plein de petites attentions adorables. L'appartement est grand et très fonctionnel. La literie est bonne et les rangements suffisants. Le bus a 5min à pied (chrono) passe toutes les 10min de 7 à 9h et des 17h, puis toutes les 30min. Il emmène au métro en moins de 10min qui est très fréquent. L'appartement est très bien desservi par les transports, même si on aimerait y arriver plus vite après une grosse journée de visite. Compter 45min du centre, porte à porte. 
Nous reviendrons !"

Emma’s apartment is stylish and cozy, and we loved coming home there after exploring the many shops, restaurants, and playgrounds in the neighborhood. Emma is a gracious and thoughtful host, and she quickly and helpfully responded to any questions we had. We’re thankful to have found such a great place, and we highly recommend it!"
822497,7035072,2013-09-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Spacious and comfortable apartment in quiet place not far from Stockholm Centre. Moa is very cute, pleasant and 	
attentive. If you travel in company of 3-5 in Stockholm I recommend to stay here. Thank you, Moa!"

822497,7277664,2013-09-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Yet another excellent Air BnB pick! Moa was the perfect host. She provided us with clear and concise instructions using public transit to arrive at her apartment where she greeted us warmly. She explained how everything worked and said we could contact her with any questions we might have had. She even left us some breakfast stuff in the fridge! The apartment was as the photos suggested. It was a lovely lived-in, sun-filled, bright, clean, tidy and spacious for two couples, which we were. Above all, although it was located outside the city centre, the metro stop was a two to three-minute walk from the apartment. The journey into and out of the city centre was 15 minutes. Hardly anything at all."

I confidently recommend you this apartment house where you can fully enjoy an extremely comfortable and convenient garden city life. Magnus is a host who provides kind communication in time with his guest in perfect English. He lives in neighborhood and provides services in accordance with guest’s request.

The subway station Gärdet is located in a quiet residential area surrounded by rich greeneries while its access from Stockholm Central Station is very convenient with taking only 6 minutes. It takes only 3 minutes on foot from a ground exit where you can directly ascend by a lift from ticket gates of the station Gärdet. A supermarket located beside the exit offers perfect items in a reasonable price, which is extremely convenient. 

You can also reach a bus stop for No.54 bus in a 4-minute-walk on a downhill footpath in the forest to the west. I fully recommend a cozy Thai restaurant located on the way because its great taste, quality and reasonable price.

A wide living and dining room, the main bedroom with a queen size bed, another bedroom with bunk beds, an easy-to-use kitchen kept tidy and in order, a bathroom with an sufficiently wide bathtub and toilet and another lavatory are well equipped. All windows consist double glasses and you can enjoy a tea time in the balcony."

1182616,192785298,2017-09-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice, kind, welcoming host and easy check in/check out. Quite good location. But wow, so dirty. The host had a very busy week with family errands and didn't have time to clean, I understand, but then he should hire cleaning services. The bathroom looked and smelled like it wasn't swabbed for months or years. I used toilet paper to wipe up water from the bathroom floor, it turned black!? Shower was dirty. The kitchen floor was filthy too. For us three girls this was very disturbing. Towels and bedsheets were provided and clean, but when we arrived to the room the previous guests bedclothes were still covering the bed.

Also, at this time it isn't clear from the description that you are renting a ROOM, not an apt, and others also renting rooms at the same time. This is only clear from reading reviews.

Overall, not good value for the money in my opinion although the location is quite good. I believe I paid a cleaning fee too which is very confusing."
1212891,77621864,2016-06-02T00:00:00.000Z,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.

763407,20335628,2014-09-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Notre séjour chez Gabriella était parfait. Tout d'abord la communication a été très facile avant la réservation. Ensuite, Gabriella a été très flexible sur les horaires de check in et check out. En effet, nous avons dû repartir 24h plus tôt car des grèves sur la compagnie aérienne avait annulé notre vol. Cela n'a posé aucun problème pour le check out.

Sur place, c'était très bien:
- l'appartement est très spacieux et très joli. Tout était impeccablement propre et rangé.
- il y avait déjà du chauffage dans la salle de bain pour notre plus grand confort (le chauffage au sol, c'est top)! Des produits cosmétiques à disposition (gel douche, shampooing etc), et de très grandes serviettes de toilette! (bien plus grandes que celles que les hôtels peuvent fournir!!
- à disposition, de quoi faire un petit déjeuner.
- l'appartement est très calme, aucun bruit de l'extérieur ne nous a gêné.

L'appartement est bien situé, tout près de la station de métro Odenplan. Facile d'accès grâce à l'ascenseur.

Je reviendrai sans hésiter chez Gabriella la prochaine fois!"

The location was excellent for us as well, easy to get around from, but not in the most touristy area. Gabriella gave us some great recommendations on restaurants and activities, which made our stay even better. Highly recommended!"
442837,3329018,2013-01-11T00:00:00.000Z,Had a lovely stay in Jo's place. As Joanna was unable to be at the house I had the pleasure of meeting and discussing the details with jo's mum who was very helpful and accommodating of my arrival and departure times. The house was very tidy and clean and secure location.

The bathroom and shared kitchen were both clean and pretty well equipped. 
Nettan herself was friendly and incredibly flexible (I arrived very early and needed to leave my bag in her flat after checkout and she was very accommodating of both requests). She was also very quick to respond to my messages and gave easy directions.
Overall I highly recommend staying here."
1182616,121318946,2016-12-16T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed in Stockholm for 4 nights and enjoyed it a lot. The apartment is very well located, right next to different shops (supermarket, bakery, café...) and a metro station.  We were satisfied with our room at Peters apartment and slept well. Kitchen is well equipped, but could use a bit more cleaning. 
I would recommend this apartment for everyone who is looking for an affordable place to stay on a great location in  Stockholm, if you are fine with a rather simple interior."
541875,5972791,2013-07-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Martin was a great host and made sure we were comfortable while we stayed at his flat. He picked us up at our arrival, took us to his place and made sure we had everything we needed (transportation tickets, took us to the nearest supermarket...). He checked back on us after a couple of days to see if everything was going alright. His flat was nice, tidy, clean and had a good location. The only but would be that the bed was quite soft and a bit unconfortable. Nonetheless, I highly recommend staying at Martin's!"
299154,120599964,2016-12-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Daniel's apartment is great! It's close to Slussen station and right at the start of the shopping street. Short walks to Gamla Stan, further up to Normalm, or deeper south into Sodermalm were effortless! The apartment is clean, a little cluttered but it's good for both of us. Communication with Daniel was also flawless, and he was so accommodating to our requests. The pizzeria downstairs and the pub nearby were where we spent our many cold cold nights!"

Maud est une hôtesse très serviable et attentionnée pour un séjour très agréable. Toutes les explications sont claires ; l'appartement est à cinq minutes à pied de la station de métro et on accède au centre-ville historique en 20 minutes à peu près. C'est fort agréable d'utiliser la cuisine pour le petit déjeuner est le repas du soir. Il y a une supérette face à la station de métro pour des premières courses ( en semaine ouvert jusqu'à 22 heures) et une grande surface à sept minutes à pied de son appartement. 
Très bon rapport qualité prix pour un appartement cosy  pour visiter Stockholm et faire des excursions dans les îles alentour.
Adresse à retenir."

He even provided some breakfast and drinks for us during our stay. The apartment was very clean and in the perfect location for our few days in the city.  I would highly recommend his apartment if you are staying in the area.
164448,18542391,2014-08-28T00:00:00.000Z,"El apartamento está muy bien ubicado de los transportes públicos, a 15 mn del centro.

647314,115830469,2016-11-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Mallika's place was great for our stay in Stockholm! My boyfriend and I stayed for two nights and we felt very at home during our stay. The bed is comfy, the room is big and bright, and the cats are adorable! Both cats are super friendly and love attention but listened when they were asked to leave our room. There's a nice tea kettle which came in handy after a day in the cold, and a nice kitchen, although we didn't end up using it. The location was a good spot in Sodermalm, which has a lot of restaurants, bars, clubs and young people. Its very easy to walk around Stockholm, but if necessary the metro stop is a few steps away around the corner.  Overall we had a great experience and would definitely recommend!"
357012,1316280,2012-05-21T00:00:00.000Z,Gorgeous and very clean apartment right near fun restaurants and awesome brunch spot (the strand).  Would recommend this apartment and checking out and staying Sodermalm when visiting Stockholm.

1158893,292118997,2018-07-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Our stay at Danny’s place was really pleasant especially because of his house. It’s pretty, cozy, warm and welcoming. Loved the tiny details/ decor throughout the house. However, our only disappointment was the location of the house which we did not really have an idea as we were unfamiliar with the locality. We didn’t initially think walking 1.5 kms approx up and down to reach the nearest station will be a problem. But after a whole day sightseeing, it was physically draining to walk back another 20 mins to reach home. Otherwise Danny was extremely welcoming and an amazing host and helped immensely with our outdoor plans. I certainly recommend his place if you keep the location in mind."

Julia et Mansour nous ont proposés un autre appartement certes plus petit mais très propre et agréable. Ils ont répondu à nos questions et nos demandes très rapidement. Je conseille les hôtes et leur appartement !

The apartment is centrally located in a very nice area of Södermalm and can easily be reached by metro; it was very clean, cosy and comfortable and we really liked the very tasteful decoration.

We would definitely come back!"

The apartment is in a great location for exploring Stockholm by walking. No need to take public transport, except maybe the boat to Djugarden as it's original (but not an obligation, we walked back)."
608672,85230447,2016-07-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Very lovely little studio flat. Good sized bedroom with a shower room and small kitchenette in excellent location close to city centre and shops. Karl was very good at communicating with us beforehand and arrival on the day was easy. Flat is clean, nicely decorated and well equipped. Items such as shampoo, hairdryer, fridge and microwave were very useful but kitchen not really suitable for making anything substantial. 

Only suggestion I would make is that the shower doesn't really work too well. It is a wet room but the water goes everywhere and is a bit difficult to properly shower.  However, we were only staying for a couple of nights so wasn't too much of an issue."
274876,496134519,2019-07-27T00:00:00.000Z,"My family lived very happily . The apartment location is nearby the No 2 and No 66 stop.You can take the two bus to go into the central of the Stockholm.

I would choose that apartment again for sure!"

The flat is much more than a usual Airbnb. It has a grill in the balcony, coffee machine in the kitchen, spices, a full set of kitchen utensils, big wardrobes, etc. Everything you can ask for and more. He was very polite and was easy to reach. We spent some time in the balcony and it gets the perfect afternoon sun. Overall, everything about the flat was perfect.

It was a marvelous experience, from the bright and spacious bedrooms, to the pleasant kitchen and dining area, including the wonderful balcony. Emma left us nice, fresh towels for our use, as well as kitchen cabinets and drawers full of all the plates / glasses / utensils and other items that made our stay very convenient. The central city location was also very advantageous and fit well with our individual plans for a wonderful vacation. We fully recommend Emma’s apartment for anyone contemplating renting a 3-bedroom facility in Stockholm. (Robert and Melissa)

My husband and I along with my brother and sister-in-law stayed in Emma's lovely apartment for 11 days this summer.  It was a wonderful experience.  The apartment was clean and well organized and beautifully decorated.  It is located in a quiet part of Stockholm yet only minutes away from lively cafes, shops, restaurants and places with breathtaking views of the city.  I met Emma when we first arrived and she was welcoming and gracious.  She offered her cell phone number and made herself available if there was anything we might need.  I would recommend Emma's apartment to anyone looking for a charming home to rent in the middle of Stockholm, large enough to share with others and still private enough to retreat to after a busy day about town.

It’s very close to convenient public transportation, including the bus to and from the airport. The pictures do a great job showing the delightful character of the space. It was very clean, the kitchen stocked (many hosts say they have a stocked kitchen - but this is the first time we could actually cook a full meal and had everything we needed from utensils to condiments). The couch and bed were very comfortable. The WiFi was reliable and fast. The shower is small but it worked out just fine. We didn’t get to meet Marie-Louise as she was abroad at the time but communication was always quick, clear and friendly. Her daughter Bianca met us at the apartment and showed us around and gave us some recommendations for nearby places to eat, visit and shop. We really appreciated the breakfast items and fruit she bought before our arrival. It was such great hospitality. We are definitely coming back."

She was incredibly friendly and welcoming, offering refreshments from the kitchen as well as a custom-made local map with her personal recommendations for me. We sat down and chatted, which really helped me to feel relaxed and at home--of course Johanna's calm yet friendly and outgoing manner helped too!

The apartment is spacious and very clean. The room is quite beautiful; I would say the photos on here don't really do it justice. Johanna also offered me use of a bicycle during my stay, and even helped me figure out the train schedule for going to the airport when I left!"

Unfortunately we missed our flight due to circumstances out of our hands and were not refunded any of the cost at all for the 2nights we'd planned to stay which was very disappointing on top of the missed flight. I contacted Peter as soon as we'd missed the flight as well.... Because of this we will be staying else where when we return."

Shops are a few minutes walk away as well as the metro which takes you to the old-town Gamlastan in around 10 minutes. Madeleine left was not there when we arrived but everything went well, she came some days later to greet us in person. The only negative thing was the elevator which was to small for our double-stroller, but this is a very specific problem ;-). We can highly recommend this flat!! Thanks to Madeleine, everything was perfect!"

Pretty good location 10 minutes from downtown. Centralen Station by subway the ideal way to move around, four blocks from the local station and only 3 stations to downtown.
Ideal for three people, four is a little too optimistic unless is a short term, the one bath is a bit of a problem.
Well equipped.
Nice neighborhood."

We had the whole flat (which was like in the pictures - charming interior, spacious, nice neighbourhood and clean) for ourselves because Anita herself wasn't there. But her neighbour took care of us, showed us the flat and gave us some tips for the surroundings and about Stockhom. 
The flat is really close to a subway which is going every 10 minutes and takes just a short ride to the important places in Stockholm.
All in all it was a very nice stay!"

The apartment is roomy for 4 adults and 1 toddler, who had her own room far enough away she wasn't disturbed by our conversations or we by her crying until she adjusted to the time change."
1124388,302860158,2018-08-06T00:00:00.000Z,"This Apartment is good for two persons.
It is great located in quiet Lilla Essingen. Just a few steps to a supermarket and the bus Station. With the bus you can directly drive to the city centre in 10-15 minutes. And it departs every few minutes.
Carl is a really nice host, he picked us up from the bus stop and was very helpful in everything.
Also the communication before arriving was good, helpful and with a lot of information."
533880,1869907,2012-08-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Perfect location: half way between the city center and the ferry terminals, the old town is reachable by foot in 15-20 minutes only. Jarl was very welcoming, everything was nicely prepared. Breakfast was provided, coffee, tea, fresh bread, eggs, milk... basically everything :) We had our privacy, it really felt like home. Great place, we highly recommend it for anyone going to Stockholm!!"
301680,90139331,2016-07-31T00:00:00.000Z,"Because my flight landed very late in the night, Anitta waited me until midnight for my arrival. Really appreciate that.
The small room is really cosy for sleep in and it's with a really convenience distance with train station."
1182616,171285114,2017-07-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Peter has a great place which is located centrally in Stockholm. The room is rustic but has everything you need, including internet.  If youre staying for a few days and are looking for a relatively inexpensive accommodation close to the center, then this is the place for you.

Peter was very helpful and responded quickly, despite not being personally in the country."
1204621,220038064,2017-12-20T00:00:00.000Z,I enjoyed my stay at Nettans for a month and half! Nettan is very kind and helpful. I highly recommend her place!

Terry even procured an extra mattress for us upon request. The apartment is located steps from the Stadion T-bana station, making it convenient to get anywhere in the city."

Wir haben Mallika nicht wirklich kennengelernt, aber sie war sehr freundlich, immer zu erreichen und sehr hilfsbereit. Man sollte wissen, dass sie 2 Katzen hat, die in der Wohnung bleiben. Wir hatten damit kein Problem. Der Stadtteil Södermalm mit den vielen Shops, Cafés und Bars hat uns super gefallen und wir können die es absolut empfehlen!"
1173290,15751547,2014-07-15T00:00:00.000Z,"My family had a very nice stay in Christian's home one week in July. 2014. The apartment is very nice and well equipped and a perfect frame for a holiday; situated in a fantastic street in a very nice area of Stockholm, the street is full of small, very good restaurants not crowed too much of tourists. Also very close to a central Metroline and also close to the bus for the airport. Christian is a very nice host and more than willing to support and provide service e.g. Christian pointed out a very fine fitness center for us. I can only recommend this apartment if you want to stay on a private home in Stockholm in a authentic   area and close to everything you need; sights, transport and local atmosphere and possibilities for shopping and nice food."

164448,283065271,2018-06-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Staying at Li's place is like staying at your favourite aunt's house. She welcomes you with a cup of coffee or tea, makes your bed, hang up your towels and clears away your dishes when you've gone out for the day. She couldn't be kinder and more generous. Her location in Södermalm was a perfect base for our adventures in Stockholm. We were able to walk to pretty much anywhere we wanted to go. Thanks for the tip about where to swim in the river and meatballs at Made in Sweden. Great host!"
1170766,40912018,2015-08-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Lovely studio, lovely host, lovely location! Clean, bright and welcoming place to stay in a super central location."

The location is superb, next to subway, shopping mall, eateries, coffee shops and public bicycles. The lake, Trekentan, is just 5 minutes walk away. I would definitely consider using the apartment if i revisit Stockholm."
533880,5021343,2013-06-08T00:00:00.000Z,"For a city trip to Stockholm it is just perfect to stay with Jarl. There is a 15 minutes walk to the center but the area is extremely calm, peaceful and nice - and Jarl is such a helpful and friendly host!"

The location is superb, there are supermarkets, convenient store and some restaurants around. And it doesn't take very long to walk to local attractions. Victor is a nice person too, kind and friendly, great communication. Highly recommended!"
1234960,41914075,2015-08-10T00:00:00.000Z,Fantastic welcome from Jacob. He was very attentive to the needs of his guests. Great house in a great location close to the Metro and supermarket. Thoroughly enjoy the welcome pack - nice touch. Interesting house with an added bonus (sauna).
242188,235558772,2018-02-17T00:00:00.000Z,"El alojamiento está muy bien comunicado por transporte público con la estación de Sodra a pocos metros, y a 1 parada de la estación central de Estocolmo.  Yo realicé la mayoría de trayectos hacia la ciudad andando, y era febrero y había nieve, es decir, el alojamiento está suficientemente cerca para ir dando un agradable paseo hasta el centro de Estocolmo. 
Lí es una excelente anfitriona, atenta, rápida en responder, deseosa de ayudar y de orientar con buenas informaciones sobre la ciudad. 
Mi habitación no era muy grande, pero era luminosa, estaba limpia y bien dotada en lo esencial.  La habitación está en la parte de arriba del piso (es tipo duplex) y fuera de la habitación hay un salón-zona común con sofás, neveras, microondas.. etc.. que te dá un espacio agradable para otros usos antes de irte a dormir.  
Creo que en conjunto es un lugar muy recomendable como opción para alojarse.  
Gracias Lí!!"
1182616,38184238,2015-07-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Die Kommunikation mit Peter war sehr gut, er hat schnell und präzise auf unsere Fragen geantwortet. Das Apartment ist sehr gut gelegen, 20 Minuten zur Fuß vom Hauptbahnhof oder noch schneller mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln zu erreichen.  Als wir ankamen war unser Zimmer noch nicht fertig gemacht und benutztes Handtuch und Bettwäsche vom Vormieter lagen noch im Zimmer (als wir zwischenzeitlich unterwegs waren wurden Handtücher und Bettwäsche dann gewechselt - die Person haben wir jedoch nie gesehen). 
Wir hatten eins der Balkon Zimmer; der Balkon ging zum Innenhof raus und es war sehr ruhig Nachts. Unser Zimmer war geht-so sauber, Badezimmer und Küche waren auch geht-so sauber (Hostel-Style). Küche war voll ausgestattet zum Kochen und mit übergebliebenen Essen ehemaliger Bewohner ( sowie Nudeln, Reis, Gewürze...). 

Peter haben wir in den drei Tagen nicht einmal gesehen. Andere Bewohner die wir kennen gelernt haben, haben Peter auch nie gesehen. Offensichtlich vermietet er die drei Zimmer des Apartments alle als airbnb Zimmer. 

Zu empfehlen für Leute die sich tagsüber und Abends nicht viel im Zimmer aufhalten wollen."
206221,35488190,2015-06-19T00:00:00.000Z,"We had an amazing week in Stockholm. This was not only because of the beautiful city, but also because of Elisabeth! 
She was incredibly kind, made us a delicious breakfast, and showed us around. We had really nice conversations with her, and she made us feel very much at home. 
The home was also perfect. There was enough space, the beds were good, and the kitchen was also nice!
The location of the apartment is also good. It's in a neighbourhood with lots of small shops and restaurants. 
We would definitely recommend Elisabeth and her apartment!"
1048260,215227997,2017-11-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Annika was the perfect host. She was very quick to respond to my messages, and did her best to answer all my questions, both before our arrival and during our trip!

Her place in Stockholm is so beautifully decorated, and we had a really comfortable stay. I loved all the nature and artwork, a really calming space to relax in after a long day of exploring the city :) 

I would highly reccomend staying at Annika's place. I have no complaints!"

Thank you Edwin for your warm hospitality."
628555,4711160,2013-05-21T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment worked out perfectly. It's only about  a 10min walk to the subway (option to get the bus either) and then about 15mins to city centre. Parking is free outside the apartment building which is very handy. While we didn't meet Anna, we communicated via text and the arrangements made for accessing the apartment worked out very well. Anna also left us some very helpful information in relation to subway maps and general information on the apartment. I would recommend this apartment. Thanks Anna  :)"
608672,25367622,2015-01-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Very nice apartment. Even though we arrived late at night (due to the weather conditions) Karl showed us around the apartment and was really kind. The apartment is small but all the essentials are there, it is perfect if you want to visit Stockholm for a few days."
608672,500572160,2019-08-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Excellent location. Comfortable room. Karin and her son, Gabriel were excellent hosts. They gave me some great tips, including restaurants and places to visit. If you plan to be in the flat during the day or evening, you should be aware that voices and movements (cooking, cleaning, etc.) in the rest of the flat are loud and clear from your room. This didn’t bother me at all, and I was pleased with my stay. I can’t say enough about the location-a couple of blocks from the metro and an easy walk to restaurants, cafes, bars, shopping. I walked to old town several times as well. Great place; I highly recommend!!"
1124388,54622836,2015-11-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Carl was a great host who waited us really late because our plane arrived has Skavsta in the evening. The apartment is clean and close to a bus stop. We just regretted the quality of braids but for the rest everything was perfect and we loved Stockholm.

Thank you again!"
581243,20982793,2014-10-08T00:00:00.000Z,"A comfortable and pleasant stay at Edwin's. He is a very kind and friendly host. He provided me promptly  with all the information I needed, in order to reach his address. His flat is located in a very convenient area, with immediate access to a tube station and hence easily connected with the center of Stockholm. His flat has been recently refurbished with a modern style and is clean and welcoming. The bedroom is spacious and tidy. The materass is very comfortable - well done on that Edwin! I had a good rest, after a long day of business meetings in town. The bathroom was clean and convenient. I did not take advantage of the living room or the kitchen, as I arrived a bit late in the evening, but they are equally tidy. The next day I left the flat, and Edwin had gone to work already. Overall I had a good stay and will probably stay again at Edwin's next time I come to Stockholm. Definitely recommended."
1041103,9053902,2013-12-03T00:00:00.000Z,"We were two couples staying for a long weeken and we absolutely loved the flat. It was the perfect size, warm, comfy beds and sofa and everything we needed. The hosts daughter met us on arrival and was very helpful and nice. Thy even left free biscuits and apples and bread! Couldn't rate this place high enough."
313195,137072457,2017-03-13T00:00:00.000Z,"We had such great time at David's apartment! During the whole booking process it was very smooth with quick response. 

The apartment is beautiful and accurate as it shows on the listing. Both beds were both very comfortable and we had a good rest at the place. Very cozy and chilled, just feels like home honestly! For girls, do bring a hairdryer with u if u need it as they don't it in the accommodation.

In term of location - the tube can be a bit of walking distance however the bus stop nearby gets u to all the location that u would needed as tourist. Big supermarket just round the corner for quick breakfast. We love the place and would love to come bk anytime! Thanks David! :)"

La stanza non è molto grande ma il letto è matrimoniale ed i materassi comodi. Il bagno è vicino alla stanza ed abbiamo usufruito anche del comodo forno a microonde che era nel soggiorno adiacente.
L'appartamento è situato nel quartiere Soderlmalm, ricco di ristoranti, supermarket, pub e negozi. 
Distante 15 minuti a piedi dalle Metro: Mariatorget o Medborgarplatsen con le quali si arriva in Gamla Stan con due fermate."

Although, she herself stayed in the living room, so whenever we needed to go out of the room (to bathroom, kitchen or out) we always went through the living room, which she is fine with, and we were not very bothered as stayed only two days (but for longer stay and some people this might be important). I love the location, it's 7 min to the tube station ad then only 3-5 stops to central station and Gamla Stan. Overall, the flat is definitely value for money!"

The Hornstull neighborhood was just what we were looking for - away from the tourist hustle and bustle but close to everything in Stockholm thanks to the subway just a 5 minute walk from the apartment.  We immediately found our \"local\", the tiny bar within a bar at Linje Tio - it was Negroni week which made us very happy.  Marie-Louie was out of town when we visited but her presence was felt.  She thoughtfully left us breakfast provisions and snacks which were much appreciated.  We loved having morning coffee looking out over the church and park across the street. We arrived late in the evening which was no problem - thank you, Carey, for staying up late to greet us and show us the lay of the land.  We enthusiastically recommend Marie-Louise's place!"

If you are thinking about staying here - just do it!"

Ausgewählt habe ich diese Unterkunft ursprünglich aufgrund der Beschreibung  \"Nature stay\". Und es stimmt. Die Wohnung liegt in einem ruhigen Wohngebiet ganz nahe an einem See und herrlich schöner Natur. 
Die Fahrt ins Zentrum ist unkompliziert, Metro-Station ist gleich um die Ecke. Auch die dort befindliche Einkaufsmöglichkeit ist praktisch.
Die Beschreibung war sehr genau und absolut zutreffend.
Linnéa selbst ist eine wunderbare Person und Gastgeberin, zu der man jederzeit mit Anliegen kommen kann, wenn etwas nicht passt - was aber nicht erforderlich war. Auch u.a. meine späte Abreise am letzten Tag war kein Thema. Deshalb:
Ein herzliches Dankeschön an Linnéa!
Alles wunderbar und absolut empfehlenswert!"

The apartment was very clean, plenty of space and in a great neighborhood. There's a metro station very close by, and Stureplan and Östermalm are right out your door to eat and drink, as are the ferries that can bring you on tours of the archipelago. Couldn't believe how well located this apartment was. 

When I return, I will certainly stay here if it's available! Thanks Mathias!"

Maud is very organized at letting you know what is on and off limits, and is very open to kitchen and bathroom use. You'll also get towels. There are 2 cats so keep in mind if you're allergic because even though they don't enter the rooms they are the furry type. Location wise you'll be a 10 min walk to the subway and a 15 min subway to downtow, It's not preciselly in the city center but for us it was great as we prefer somwhere calm."

The place is very clean, very well located and Mikael is the best host. He remembered that my husband liked IPA's and filled the fridge with some! The communication with Mikael is always great and he has great recommendations for places to eat. His place is definitely a must if you're visiting Stockholm!"

Daniel was very welcoming and making contact with him went as smooth as it could be.   Although the apartment says it is for 4 people, and it will sleep four people fairly comfortably the apartment was so small that it was very difficult to find room for luggage for 3 people.  I would highly recommend this place for 1 or 2 people."
1212891,30291063,2015-04-20T00:00:00.000Z,Maud's place is situated in a quiet part of Kungsholmen (The subway only 5 min walk).The building itself was also quiet. The flat is not big but cosy and the room is nice for one person. You share the kichen and bathroom (all very tidy). Staying with Maud is relaxing and natural. She helps you where she can. The cats play an important role in your stay.

Right next to the water, near bars/supermarkets/tube lines - all super. The flat was exactly as described which is always nice. One warning is that if you open the kitchen/dining table - be very careful to pull out the corner 'leg' as our plates fell off the table and smashed on the floor :( Annelie was very kind and accepted our plate replacements. Overall it was a perfect place for a weekend in Stockholm - highly recommend !"

536283,83428619,2016-07-02T00:00:00.000Z,Paolo was a great host. He gave us plenty of information in the lead up to our stay and was very organised. His apartment is well-located with some lovely cafes and shopping nearby.
1170766,23078202,2014-11-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Annika is an ideal host being both caring and attentive without being intrusive.  We always had the feeling that she had our welfare as a priority.
Location is good for public transport, everyday shops and walking across to Gamla Stan and beyond.  There are a collection of second-hand and charity shops in this district that are worth an explore; in one of these shops avoiding the clothes scrum I bought an oil painting for £28 that turn out to be worth maybe £500, on investigation back in England!
The flat at the top of the building does not have a lift but we warned about this beforehand -it can be a slog late at night, but the we found the flat inherently warm despite the cold weather at that time of year (mid-November).  It is quiet too and lots of windows and a balcony to look out of.
A good base as a tourist and also for business and the free WiFi was fast and problem free.  
Happy to recommend."

The only thing that was a bit awkward for us was that the quilt was a bit small for two people, but we told her about it and I'm sure she will consider it."
