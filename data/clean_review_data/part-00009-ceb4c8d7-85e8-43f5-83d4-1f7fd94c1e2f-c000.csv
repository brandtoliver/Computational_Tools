575371,94550505,2016-08-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Das Zimmer war genau wie beschrieben, die Couch reicht allemal für 2 Personen und das eigene Bad bietet super Komfort. Tomas und seine Familie sind super freundliche Gastgeber. Uns haben sie den ein oder anderen Tipp gegeben, wir hatten aber auch unsere Ruhe und Privatsphäre. Die Lage der Wohnung ist spitze, viele Cafés in der Nähe sind gut zu Fuß zu erreichen und man ist innerhalb weniger Minuten in der Altstadt.
Alles in allem ein super Aufenthalt in Stockholm! Vielen Dank Tomas!"

819676,125694472,2017-01-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice room. Better in real life than  it looks on the pictures. The room and the private bathroom are quite isolated from the main part of the flat, so it's almost like if you had an entire flat, but on the other hand you can easily reach for the hosts if wanted/needed."
1054406,286354611,2018-07-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Really nice place, big rooms. We stayed here with two small kids and they have enough space to play."
343925,7696534,2013-09-30T00:00:00.000Z,Annika was very friendly and hospitable. We enjoyed that the place was close to the subway. We were able to find everything we needed. It was the perfect place to rent for a couple on a weekend. Annika even kindly accommodated an extra guest at the last minute. I would definitely stay with her again.
700113,40402136,2015-07-30T00:00:00.000Z,Ilona is a great host and her apartment is conveniently located. I would recommend her without any reservations!
164448,172833859,2017-07-22T00:00:00.000Z,Li went above and beyond expectations of a host. The space is lovely. It was nice to be near restaurants but away from all the tourist. Her apartment is located right on the major transit line and next to buses.
954832,5707308,2013-07-13T00:00:00.000Z,"It was our first time in Stockholm and the first time with airbnb. Mikael was a very friendly host, made us feel very welcome, answered all our questions and was helpful in any way! Despite a late arrival due to a canceled flight, Mikael was easily reachable - everything was very uncomplicated. The appartment is located in a nice and central area and there is very easy access to public transport. We primarily used buses, which get you quickly to interesting places - a nice way to get to know the city. We had a lovely time in Stockholm, especially thanks to Mikael and his trustworthy and uncomplicated hospitality.

1212891,41254877,2015-08-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud is one of the most conscientious and thoughtful hosts that we have ever stayed with. You don't even realize how small her apt is because she takes care of every single detail. Our room was spotless and she keeps the entire apartment clean even though she has two (gorgeous) cats and another guest when we were there. She marks down everything clearly in her apt for her guests so that it is clear what is ok for them to use - I really appreciated that. It was very easy to get to the city center, and I would highly recommend Maud's place to anyone as it is excellent value for money. Also her cats are hypo-allergenic so don't worry even if you have cat allergies :)"
274876,4783236,2013-05-26T00:00:00.000Z,"We couldn't have enjoyed staying at Emma's lovely pad more. It's a great space to hang out in and relax, spotlessly clean, comfortable and with all mod cons. It's a great location, 10 mins walk to downtown Sodermalm but also quiet enough that you get peace and quiet. Emma herself was so helpful and welcoming, being really flexible about arrival times and giving us hints and tips before she departed to make our stay a great one. Stockholm is a beautiful and friendly city, with loads to do; we could have stayed longer than our 4 days. All in all a great experience - as a first time Air BnBer, I'll do it again, and would wholeheartedly recommend Emma's lovely flat for a stay in Stockholm."
1204621,13514271,2014-05-29T00:00:00.000Z,"The stay at Nettan's place was a real treat. Nettan is really kind and helpful, and the apartment is tidy, stylish and luminous. Magical cooking stove.

The location is a wonder for the eyes in the bright morning sun, with its view of the haven in early golden shimmer.

Strongly recommended!"
700113,21349411,2014-10-15T00:00:00.000Z,The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
819676,152710650,2017-05-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Our stay in Stockholm was enhanced by having Andy and Vannie as our hosts. We encountered lost luggage on our flight from Copenhagen to Stockholm and Andy assisted in receiving the suitcase when delivered the following morning. Our stay in Stockholm was split as we took an overnight ferry to Riga, Latvia and Andy coordinated our departure and return perfectly so we were able to capitalize on our time exploring Stockholm. This AirBnB location was perfect in regard to proximity to Gamla Stan. Thanks for a great visit!"
1182616,315670015,2018-08-29T00:00:00.000Z,Great adventure at Peter's place he is really nice Host. Nice place near the city centre and nice neighbourhood. You have all you need around!
581243,315546774,2018-08-29T00:00:00.000Z,We made a very pleasant stop at Edwin's. The apartment is superb and very well placed. We were able to find space to park our car. On Edwin's wise advice we were able to make a brief discovery of a Stockolm district a stone's throw from his home. Our stopover was short because we had our ferry early the next day but we keep a very good memory.
1182616,10381236,2014-02-17T00:00:00.000Z,"The room was warm and clean.The access to the kitchen is good, and so we reduced the costs .The location near the metro and supermarket is super.  .Peter gives us clear directions to find his apartment.
We have'nd had problems, there is no way to lockthe room'doors."
858902,157637143,2017-06-04T00:00:00.000Z,A great place to stay at. A very central location. Lotta has a nice personality and easy to get along with!

610034,4495786,2013-05-08T00:00:00.000Z,Ida was very kind and very easy to reach for any questions of organisation. Her appartment is well located in the great area of Sodermalm.
1244657,79746814,2016-06-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Nic and Usha were great hosts. The room was as described and their apartment was in a fantastic, central location. Nic and Usha were friendly and provided me with many suggestion of places to visit in Stockholm. We enjoyed some good conversations and l would definitely recommend their home to other travellers."

220851,12352759,2014-04-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Staying with Fredric is like staying with an old friend! You feel completely at home and are able to come and go as you please. Fredric is a great host and the flat is clean, comfortable and relaxing. I can't recommend staying here highly enough!"

The accommodations were as described
Great  location- near metro and walkable to restaurants and even into city."
299154,5252973,2013-06-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice and clean apartment~ small but sweet^_^ Daniel is so friendly. I ask him, where is the garbage bags and suger, he come and show them to me! So nice~~  And in the kichen you can find everything you need! There is a balcony for 3 people to eat on it. It is wonderful! If i'll be back, i'm sure i'll still live in his apartment. So, see you next time~ Daniel^_^"
954832,48992816,2015-09-30T00:00:00.000Z,It' was an awesome experience. The apartment was clean and exactly what you saw on the ad. It's close to all good places! Mikael is a great host. He's helpful and accommodating. I definitely recommend this place.
1271843,476376886,2019-06-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Charming, generous host in a sparkling, well-appointed flat. The location is wonderful, just steps from the Mariatorget station in our very favorite neighborhood. No street noise at all—quietest spot we stayed in Sweden and a great night’s sleep."
575371,150260572,2017-05-07T00:00:00.000Z,Quiet neighbourhood close to the railway station. One train stop from central station.  Good to have our own bathroom.
451155,12558121,2014-05-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Very good experience. The house is very nice: well equiped, spacious and quiet. The neighborhood is also very pleasant: very green and quiet. 
Unfortunately we never had the opportunity to meet Malin but everything went well :)"
1234960,91999605,2016-08-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Great location, very close (5 min walk) to metro station and to city centre. Comfortable house with nice and wide garden and rooms in a remarkably quiet neighborhood. Jacob is a fantastic host and he gave us some tips for our stay, like a lovely restaurant in the city centre specialised on traditional food or good places to have a bath."
916806,19294896,2014-09-09T00:00:00.000Z,Beautiful apartment and location is terrific. The host was very helpful and was always at hand to provide any support.
242188,472739756,2019-06-20T00:00:00.000Z,I really enjoyed my stay. Li was a kind host with helpful information. The space was great for one person. I also think the location was perfect. I would definitely recommend it.
897584,4839159,2013-05-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Viveka`s apartment is great and ideal for a couple, very clean and eclectically designed throughout, her patio overlooks a small forest and we were lucky enough to spot some deers wondering around. Although she was traveling at the time of our visit and wasn't around to meet us, she was very helpful via text messaging and email (whenever we had a question she would reply straight away with an answer). Her flat is situated 5 min walk from Ornsberg metro station and about one minute from a bus stop that takes you to Liljeholmen (red line), it took us about 20 minutes to get to Galma Stan. We Will defo come back again to stay at Vivekas - we recommend her place to everyone !"
700113,462516308,2019-06-02T00:00:00.000Z,Ilona is really good host. Communication before coming to Stockholm was fine and check in was very smooth. I really recommend it.
478105,199080749,2017-10-01T00:00:00.000Z,"If you're looking for a place that's close to public transport, good restaurants, grocery stores, playgrounds/parks and wilderness, then this is the place for you! Christian's place is charming and full of character. The apartment was very clean, the beds were comfortable, the kitchen was well-equipped for cooking (we cooked quite a few meals at home) and it's located in a fantastic location. There's 2 balconies and a picnic table outside. Honestly, we couldn't have picked a better place. We're so happy with our decision to stay at Christian's. 

Christian was fantastic with answering all of our questions, giving us tips and making sure we got to and from the airport safely. He is genuinely friendly, sweet, thoughtful and helpful and his place was perfect for our needs. We HIGHLY recommend."
1262188,8083081,2013-10-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Hello, we had a fine time at Karin`s flat, the appartment was clean and in top condition, the location had a good transport connection and Karin was very helpful. I only can recommend Södermalm-flat!
hasta, Matthias"
1271843,297776637,2018-07-28T00:00:00.000Z,"I booked Andre’s apartment for my friends couple. 
First of all, communication with Andre was always quick, easy and smooth. It gave me an strong impression, that everything will go well in this trustworthy person’s place for sure, and it really went so. 

My friends really liked the beautiful apartment and told me that Andre was a super nice person :-) Location was, as many of others have written here also, perfect. Thank you very much Andre!!!"
370744,114540538,2016-11-19T00:00:00.000Z,This apartment is located near a lot of local and also tourist spots. The metro station is right next to the flat so it's extremely convenient. The house is extremely comfortable and my co-workers and I enjoyed hanging out in the living room. Lina's friend let us in and was very helpful and accomodating.
954832,319657110,2018-09-07T00:00:00.000Z,"A gem. Ticks every box plus special touches to make the stay even more comfortable. Spotless. Ideal location, lightning fast communication, every need catered for, easy check in and out. Highly recommended."
723539,4587320,2013-05-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Mathias apartement is all what the advert said it was. Central location with walking distance to most of the interesting location in Sthlm, super clean and comfy. He's resourceful and gives us few useful tips about Sthlm which quite helpful. I would recommend a short stay at his place."
1054406,519357350,2019-08-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Thomas ist ein hervorragender Gastgeber, er stellt alles zur Verfügung, was man für einen tollen Stockholmtrip benötigt (sogar ein Starterpaket im Kühlschrank!!!)Wir- ein Paar mit Baby- haben das Apartment sechs Tage gemietet. Es besteht aus drei Räumen und liegt parterre. Man kann direkt vor der Tür parken! Die Unterkunft befindet sich in einer ruhigen Einfamilienhausgegend und liegt in der Nähe des Sees Långsjön. Mit Pkw ist man in 15Min Downtown (Gamla Stan/Schloss),sehr guter ÖPNV ist aber auch vorhanden (Selbst die Stammkarten werden von Thomas gestellt!!).
Wir können die Unterkunft empfehlen und würden wiederkommen."
858902,164114436,2017-06-26T00:00:00.000Z,Awesome location (easy to get to everything) and very friendly & knowledgeable host. Definitely recommend.
763407,4367655,2013-04-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Absolutely amazing time in Stockholm. The apartment is superb with everything you might need, very spacious, well kept, everything woks perfectly and its quite close to everything. Neighborhood is excellent. Gabriella was nothing short of a perfect host, gave us good advice on where to go and what to see. I just wish i could have stayed longer."
858902,45692369,2015-09-05T00:00:00.000Z,Wonderful room in a very nice neighbourhood. The city centre is in a walkable distance. And the host is very friendly and gives good advice for hot spots.
770995,99091395,2016-09-03T00:00:00.000Z,"This 3 bedroom apartment was spacious and had amazing TV and sound system. Nice, quiet place good for resting and for my group (working/conference). It was easy to hook our phones and lap tops up to sound system to play our music. Location very close to the train and easy walk to walk to central station, waterfront, and shopping. Area around apt. also has a lot to offer in terms of restaurants, bars, night life & cafes. Peter went out of his way to make our group feel welcome, including picking me up at the train and even leaving food & drinks for us. When one of us left something in the apt. he let us know immediately so we can go get it. Excellent stay!"
1255668,12537221,2014-05-05T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a great stay at Sandra's fantastic apartment in Stora Essingen. It was the most beautiful and tastefull apartment we have rented. Spacious, bright and classy, with a sunny balcony and nice garden. The area was also really nice and quiet, but only a short bussride from the city. We would love to stay here again!!!"
1128990,83345704,2016-07-02T00:00:00.000Z,"My host, Yvonne was a very warm lady, with a very pleasing personality. She was ready to help with any questions I had about just anything! Although internet connection was intermittent, her place was indeed a surprise, nice and quiet, right in the middle of an urban neighborhood. It was accessible to eating places, the supermarket, and a convenient store was just almost next to the apartment in the corner. Parks were also such a welcome boost, plus a quick walk towards a beautiful overlooking view of the river and the sunset while I was there -- these were enough to connect me to nature and make me feel relaxed especially after a hectic one-week Conference! I even had to walk only 5 min.to get to the Church last Sunday. The Old Town and museums were also walking distance. Super like! I strongly recommend Yvonne's place!"
916806,179237893,2017-08-07T00:00:00.000Z,Nice apartment 10 min walk from shops and subway that brings you to central Stockholm in 20 min.
1262188,462483486,2019-06-02T00:00:00.000Z,Appartement très bien situé proche de toutes commodités et à 10/15 à pieds du centre de Stockholm
819676,86740596,2016-07-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Andy and Vannie were not at home and asked a friend to be there to give me/get back the keys, it was very convenient."
1182616,21555836,2014-10-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Staying at Peter's was great! We only saw Peter once but he was kind and friendly. He was also very good with communicating quickly and helping with any questions. We arrived earlier than expected and he was able to get our room together earlier than arrival by the time we were there.

His place was clean and comfortable. It was a nice place to come back and relax. We did not explore the area around his place but we felt safe around it and it was nice. The location is not the closest to the sights and main attractions. However, it was close to the metro which we used whenever going to and from his place which was very easy. It took about 20-30 minutes to get to most of the main attractions.

I would stay at Peter's again."
299154,57812229,2015-12-29T00:00:00.000Z,"The location of the apartment is ideal, just 2 metro stops away from the central station and minutes of walk away from Gamla Stan. Daniel met us in the apartment to hand us the keys and also gave a few tips on what to do in Stockholm. Apartment is cosy and nice to stay in, except cause the toilet flush wasn't working well or smthg so there was an unpleasant smell, but otherwise the apartment is fine :)"
536691,492505620,2019-07-21T00:00:00.000Z,"The appartment is light, spatious and very well decorated. You will feel yourself at home immediately! It is centrally located with a lot of nice shops, coffeebars and restaurants in the neighbourhood. There is a metrostation nearby, but we did everything by foot or by bike (best to make a reservation if you want to rent bikes)."
220851,26153106,2015-02-05T00:00:00.000Z,"I was here for a whole month and definitely recommend this place! The apartment is very nice, with a large room with good light. Very homely, filled with different artworks and with a good bathroom and kitchen. Lovely area, close to the T-bana and busses so it is convenient to get almost anywhere! There are also grocery stores, cafes, restaurants etc. within a couple of minutes of the apartment. Satya is a great host; very relaxed and happy to talk or leave you to yourself. Very happy to have met him, we had some good conversations :) He was also nice enough to extend my stay a few days at short notice."
1182616,143953438,2017-04-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Well located in Stockholm. The metro station is on the other side of the street. Lots of convenience around. The apartment is quiet at night, bed is comfortable. Peter doesn't live there, we never met him. We found at one point the place was too crowded. The are 2 bedrooms and the living rooms are all rented. In the living room he rents the place for 4 and more people. At one point we were 8 people in the place with only one bathroom, it was a bit too crawded."
1303522,96447835,2016-08-22T00:00:00.000Z,"We loved our stay at Camilla's great apartment! We felt at home immediately - there was plenty of space to set up shop in, yet still cozy. The neighborhood was the perfect one to be in, especially on the weekend when we were but steps away from the awesome market. The access to both the city and a mini escape to nature with the waterfront paths was exactly what we wanted. 

Camilla was also super communicative and thoughtful, and bent over backwards to be sure our arrival and departure were smooth. We hope to stay here again! We'll most certainly be coming back to the great city of Stockholm."
916806,29210183,2015-04-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Fantastic view
Convenient location to attractions in Stockholm

1212891,37448998,2015-07-07T00:00:00.000Z,Maud made me feel very welcome. The room is cozy and the bed comfortable . Maud also gave me good suggestions  for touring the city.

451155,16388740,2014-07-27T00:00:00.000Z,We enjoyed the holiday in Malins House very much. The house is so beautiful and well furnished. It’s perfect for a family holiday in Stockholm: The “Tunellbana” is easy to reach and there is also a supermarket. Highly recommended!
299154,9372352,2013-12-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Great location, very fast replies from Daniel. I would recommend this!"

242188,10882298,2014-03-11T00:00:00.000Z,"I spent lovely 5 days in Stockholm, and that's only partially due to the great weather I encountered - the other reason is that Lidia is a great host with a great space right in the middle of Södermalm. Transportation is convenient, the flat has a great view, decently sized rooms, plenty of other space and good amenities. Lidia is an excellent host: super friendly, very keen on making sure her guests feel instantly at home...somehow there always seems to have a cup of coffee or tea ready :) So thanks for the great time, I do plan to be back and I recommend very much to anybody intending to travel to STO to see if there's a room available at Lidia's."
206221,82657660,2016-06-28T00:00:00.000Z,"My friend and I had a great time at Elisabeth's place. The apartment is in a quiet location and the room has a nice cosy feel. We felt very much at home and could come and go as we please. Breakfast in the morning was hearty and consisted of bread, yogurt, meat, cheese, and some fruit. Elisabeth also makes excellent French press coffee!

One thing to note: the showerhead in the bathtub doesn't have a holder or an attachment to the wall (at least in time of writing), so we had to hold it with one hand while showering, but it wasn't a huge concern for us.

Overall, Elisabeth is very warm, friendly, and made us laugh numerous times with her humor. Thank you, Elisabeth, for your hospitality. Staying with you was definitely one of the highlights of our trip! :)"
755843,124551575,2017-01-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Par was super helpful and accommodating our late arrival and suggested what to do and where to go nearby and in the city that might be of interest.
The place is very well located for a city visit, comfortable and relaxing in between busy tourist days."

164448,140659977,2017-03-31T00:00:00.000Z,"It was my first Airbnb stay and it was much better than expected! 
Lidia was very friendly and explained everything about Stockholm. She probably tells all the insider information very often, but she was not board of this. 
Thanks for the grade stay!"
1271843,244953489,2018-03-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Andre and Camilla make you feel welcome and offer you a home away from home. Everything is clean and tastefully furnished, within a few minutes you find shops and trendy restaurants (good suggestions from Andre and Camilla). The next metro station is 3-5 minutes away and the old town of Stockholm in about 20 min. by foot. For a short stay in Stockholm highly recommended :-) Thanks to Andre and Camilla to share this welcoming place with us!"
1244657,458030000,2019-05-25T00:00:00.000Z,"The place is simply AMAZING! The location is great to go to other places and there are many local restaurants nearby. It is close to most attractions within a 10-20minute walk, so you don't actually have to call a taxi or ride bicycles to get there. Both Nic and Usha are very nice people. They are friendly and very good host.  I would highly recommend this place."

Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt in der kleinen, aber besonders gemütlichen und sehr cool eingerichteten Wohnung in dem coolen Viertel Södermalm. In der Nähe ist eine U-Bahn Station und ein Supermarkt. Es hat uns sehr gut bei Anton gefallen und wir kommen gerne wieder."

916806,201837236,2017-10-09T00:00:00.000Z,Great value! It was nice to have all the green space around. I loved how dark the room was at night! As noted it's about 10 or so minutes from the metro station with a 20-25 minute metro ride. The metro ran frequently even on weekends so we were never waiting for a train long. Communication was great and we were able to check out a bit late to accommodate our late trip to the airport which made our day so much easier. All in all a lovely stay.

There are 3 grocery stores that were each within 2 blocks (I liked ICA) - and TONS of restaurants and coffee houses that are really close - 2 coffee places just around the corner.   This place is in THE BEST location - not too much traffic noise - but close to EVERYTHING - esp. via the subway - 2 stops to central station.   The subway station /buses were right across the street - just steps away. Big screen TV has TIVO and tons of station many of them in English.  I loved the place and Martin was a really great host  very helpful and quick to reply if I had a question.   dates of my stay: May 16-July 25, 2016"

The Room is spacious and light with lovely view of ferry harbour. Kitchen is well equipped and breakfast table has same nice view. The building is conveniently located 200 metres from a supermarket, 5 minutes from a bus station into town centre (number 1) and also about 7 minutes from the underground trains (Gardet). It is a little outside the centre (but near enough to centre) which is nice if you wish to feel you're outdoors/nature, run or walk in nearby Djurgarden or stroll past the various beautiful embassy mansion villas along the canal walkway to Strandvagen."

I found it : it is Martin's flat. Very well located near Karlaplan, closed to all facilities, metro, buses and shops. There was every thing my parents needed  : food, cleaning products, touristic brochures, etc..."
1182616,86589932,2016-07-17T00:00:00.000Z,We hebben via de mail contact gehad met Peter en hem helaas niet persoonlijk ontmoet. Ons bed was keurig opgemaakt en Peter hield ons op de hoogte van bijzonderheden. Er waren nog twee kamers verhuurd. De kamer met balkon kwam aardig overeen met de foto's.

We chose it because it looked warm and comfy and was located close to our apartment. Which is in the best part of the city, but we are biased :-). The apartment was clean, roomy, tons of books to peruse through and well decorated. For 5 people there was more than enough space and the extra bathroom was definitely a bonus. My inlaws were really happy and comfortable. They were very pleased with everything. 5 stars all around!"
954832,7006486,2013-09-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Stockholm, the apartment and the hosts are very lovely!! We enjoyed our stay with Mikael very much, he was always reachable by phone and very helpful with everything we needed!
The apartment is great, especially if you like to cook small meals because you don't want to or can't afford going out all the time.
The location is awesome as it very very central and also has great shopping possibilities. The one and only downside is the noise, which can keep you from sleeping. But it is definitely worth it :)"

There were 6 of us in the apartment and we had plenty of space. We ate twice at Shanti. Very good Indian food. We played cards at Brewdog. We watched Sweden play soccer at Brickyard. And enjoyed a vegan smorgasbord at Hermans.
The walk along Katarina Bangata was a beautiful tree lined stroll. 
We walked most places and found being in this location very nice. The T was close too.... About 10 minutes walk

Thank you Maria"

His house is spacious and is true to the pictures. It's both convenient to the city with a short walk to the station and in a quiet residential area. Our daughter loved the trampoline and the visiting deer."

He was also available via phone during our stay and gave us some tips for the Hornstull area. His flat is very central and close to the subway, the area has a lot of restaurants and is close to various shops. The flat has a really original and scandinavian style, we liked it so much!

Das Appartment selbst ist einfach aber funktional eingerichtet - die alten Möbel versprühen den Charme vergangener Zeiten. Obwohl das Appartment an einer stark befahrenen Straße liegt, ist es erstaunlich ruhig (solange man die Fenster geschlossen hält). Der Check-In war  absolut problemlos und Christin hat alle unsere Fragen rasch beantwortet. Alles in allem haben wir ein paar wirklich schöne Tage in Stockholm verbracht."

They have a great location too, easy walking distance to Gamla Stan and ~20min walk to Stockholm Central station. If I'm ever back in Stockholm I'd definitely stay again!"

The location is also perfect: Stockholm is just a 15 minute drive away and when you are done discovering this wonderfull city you can relax in the very quiet neighbourhood around the house. The contact with Jacob went really well, he made sure to check in with us and did everything in his possibilities to make us feel at home, he is a great host. We were there with our 11 month year old baby, but with an open stair nearby it was a bit of a hassle sometimes, but that's what happens when you have a baby. All in all we've had a great time here and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to visit Stockholm!"

This place have everything that you can ask for... cozy bed, convenient kitchen, clean bathroom and they are come with fabulous view of the river that you can see it every time you wake up. Pretty nice neighbourhood, a little bit of quiet not like in the city centre.

And Nettan is very nice and sincere host. We have a good talk and she tells me a lot of things about Sweden, quite fascinating! She also suggest me about where to go and hangout like local that you not gonna see it in typical guide book.

Overall, this is a great place to stay and you will not gonna regret it! I promise :)"

As the apartment is located on top of  the shopping centre it is very convenient  for getting things and many other aspect.  
The room was very clean, quiet and warm. 

I have walked to the apartment from the Stockholm central station. Because he described it will be only 25 minutes distance. However it took much longer and was quite hard. I would not recommend walking in snowy steep road especially when you have luggages. 

It was nice stay."

608672,21361972,2014-10-15T00:00:00.000Z,Karl was a very welcoming host for my visit to Stockholm. The apartment was located in a beautiful building and was very centrally located. The shower/toilet room was a bit small but other than this I would recommend this room to visitors on a short trip.
242188,83194445,2016-07-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia is amazingly great host! She helped me a lot, charming and also tolerant of the other culture.
I had stayed here for more than 3 weeks and spent many hours with her and talked a lot.
Fridge, kettle, coffee…everything you need for travel is here. And Lidia allowed me to use laundry too.
The location is perfect for sightseeing in Stockholm. It’s very convenience to get to the center of Stockholm and also SOFO area. But so quiet.
Close to the subway station and bus station, too. There are many nice cafes around here.
I came to Stockholm for studying Swedish, the room was so comfortable to study. And she also taught me Swedish! Tack så mycket, Lidia!
場所もとても便利で､Lidiaも最高にすてき 克つ ﾌﾟﾛ意識の高いﾎｽﾄです｡強くｵｽｽﾒします!"

688947,88305773,2016-07-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Our stay at Alexandre's house was great. The location is good as well; near the T-bana station, which takes 15-20 minutes to the city centre. The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful and the house was fully equipped as mentioned in the description.  Unfortunately the wifi did not work while we stayed there but the host offered us to use his phone if we needed internet connection. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at Alexandre's house."
581243,3888040,2013-03-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin makes everything easy. The room is confortable and very clean, the use of the kitchen very convenient. The supermarket is downstairs.

The place is very close to the metro stop and the neighborhood is very nice. Jon is a great host, even though we arrived at 1AM to the apartment he was waiting for us with a smile and took the time to explain us all related the apartment and give us some tips about the city. I definitely recommend John's apartment."
739726,20789819,2014-10-05T00:00:00.000Z,"This is a really nice apartment. It was well kept and extremely clean, and in a lovely part of Stockholm. There is a great cafe across the road that does delicious cinnamon buns, and I felt it was a clean and safe. The bedroom is in an alcove off the living room. I made a mistake when booking and didn't see that there was no internet -I really do think this should be in the flat description and not just buried in the list of amenities. Unfortunately the host was not great about responding to my concerns and we didn't get to meet at my scheduled arrival as she had to catch a boat.   Overall a positive experience but I was a little upset about the lack of communication."

620848,3567058,2013-02-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Staying at Hannah & K Lundholm apartment was an absolute pleasure for us! It's a 10-minute train ride from the city center, or less if you want to go to Södermalm. And trains come really often. The apartment is big enough to stay with 4. Everything is well equipped, sheets, pillows, towels, tableware... Internet is fast and the TV has enough channels. Communication was fast and clear."

536283,31487744,2015-05-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Paolo's flat was great for our 2 night break to Stockholm. In a great location, everything we needed was easily accessible by foot. 

The flat itself was very clean and tidy and felt like a home away from home. Paolo was super quick with his responses and really helpful and accommodating with his check in/check out times. Would thoroughly recommend."
543045,69529568,2016-04-11T00:00:00.000Z,Anton was a very kind host:) He told us about good places to go and the communication was perfect. The apartment was nice and clean!

The room was exactly as described and was toasty warm despite being almost freezing outside! Would highly recommend this place to stay. Beds super comfortable as well, slept so well! In a great part of town as well with great cafes and restaurants close by. If you get time, go to the restaurant called \"Meatballs\" just around the corner, 10/10 food! Thanks again Anette, hopefully see you again! Oli & Megan."
536283,48761873,2015-09-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Paolo was very responsive and replied swiftly to communications, right from my first enquiry. He provided clear instructions on how to get to the apartment, as well as detailed check-in/out information.

CHECKING IN 
This was a smooth process because the apartment block was centrally located, just a short 30–35 minutes cab ride from the airport. Paolo informed me earlier that he will not be around for the check-in but using the GlueLock app to get in was a breeze.

APARTMENT
The space was exactly as pictured/described, but a lot prettier. It seems Paolo has just completed a few new pieces of art and they were displayed in the apartment – lovely pops of colour. The kitchen was also very well stocked and Paolo generously invited me to help myself to anything I might need. 

The bed seems to be a double but it's really good for one person; it would be snug for two (as the listing suggested). But Paolo included an extra mattress in case it was necessary. While I didn't set it up, there was more than enough room to set up the extra bed. The bathroom was clean and fresh towels were provided. A small blowdryer was also provided.

LOCATION
It was my first visit to Stockholm and I have not stayed anywhere else in the city. But I cannot imagine a more central location to stay and explore the city. There is a supermarket a block away and the main Götgatan street is less than 2 minutes walk away. While it was very central, the street where Paolo's apartment is on is rather quiet. There were occasional loud conversations from the street but this was only because I left one of the windows open.

Several of the city's popular bakeries, cafes and restaurants were a short walk away – Cafe String, Pom & Flora, Bakvervet, Bagerie Petrus, Gondolen, Nook, Nytorget 6 and more. It also took me less than 30 minutes to walk to Gamla Stan.

I highly recommend Paolo's apartment if you're in the city for a few days and looking to explore the vibrant Södermalm neighbourhood on foot, and even Gamla Stan. It was in a great location and Paolo made the stay extra welcoming with his warm messages and quick replies."
581243,301942765,2018-08-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Great value for money ! The apartment is really nice. The room and adjacent bathroom are very spacious, and it's super clean. Felt very private and comfortable. Check-in instructions were clear."
145320,271098522,2018-05-31T00:00:00.000Z,"Kim's place is in a great location with lots of fun shopping and restaurants around. The place was very cute and comfortable with a lived in but tidy vibe. We didn't meet Kim until our second day but she was very helpful in checkin and in offering tips about Stockholm! Finally, she was very accommodating in letting us stay an extra hour and a half when our other Airbnb pushed back the check in time. Great place to stay if you want to see a different side of Stockholm but still have access to the more touristy areas!"
819676,116177700,2016-11-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Close to the subway station, but if you are using US version of (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps, it will be somewhat tricky to find. I'm somewhat new to Airbnb and didn't look in the correct place for Andy & Vannie's last name - you will need this to buzz into the building! The area is convenient to Sodermalm and Gamla Stan areas, and was a good stop for a night in Stockholm."
575371,92625647,2016-08-09T00:00:00.000Z,Thomas and Guru were great hosts. We had a very pleasant time and provider us with a lot of good tips. The room was very private and clean and the separation bathroom was a plus.

He even met us early when our bus arrived before schedule. The apartment is small, but accurately described and in an ideal location. The apartment building has an elevator, very handy for luggage. The kitchen is small, but sufficient for breakfasts and pasta. The bathroom and kitchen share a sink. Great host, great city."

Design aesthetic was very trendy as well. He was also very helpful with food suggestions. Hornstull is full of cafes, restaurants, and chic shops. There's even an underground grocery store / shopping mall really close. We'd stay here again without hesitation."

I took an overnight flight to Stockholm & Lidia was kind enough to let me in to drop off my luggage in the morning, which was wonderful.  The SL train stop near her place is on the same line as Arlanda airport, which made it very easy to get to & her directions from the train stop to the apartment made the place very easy to find."

Lidia is a very nice lady. She offered me coffee or tea when I was home, gave me valuable recommendations on the places worth to see and marked for me on the map. I have had a very pleasant 3-day stay in Stockholm thanks to her kind help. 
I would stay here again given any chance and recommend her flat to others."

Christian met us when we got there, gave us a quick tour, and everything was easy to find and use. The apartment was very comfortable, spacious, bright cozy, and the two floors each have bedrooms and bathrooms, so it was easy to \"spread out\" and have our own space, even while staying in the same apartment. Christian has a very reasonable list of \"house rules\" and that should only demonstrate to you that he cares about you and the apartment more than most. The full kitchen had all the little things you might need, the bathrooms both have showers, there are two balconies, and it feels like a home, not a rental. We had absolutely no complaints.

The apartment itself is spotless , very functional for a couple and equipped will all that you need to make yourself feel at home.
In addition the tasteful decor creates a beautiful ambience and then the Swedish tradition of candles through the house really give it good Zen.

1255668,189218868,2017-09-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Absolutely loved staying at Sandra's place. Lovely apartment with a small garden which you can also use. Clean, well equipped, has also good location with buses and there is a tram stop as well. Sandra was lovely and very helpful."
608672,112876889,2016-11-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Karl was a very nice and helpful host. He even texted us that it was possible to check in before the usual check in time, which was just what we had hoped for and he have us a warm welcome! We stayed in his place for three nights during our Stockholm city trip. The apartment is small and cozy and the even though the shower is a little \"old fashioned\" we were totally satisfied with this accommodation. The building is very old, has high ceilings, an  old elevator and is just beautiful. The distance to the tunnelbana and the city center couldn't have been better and we can definitely recommend everyone to stay at Karl's apartment!"
242188,78154677,2016-06-05T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment is located in a great neighborhood within easy walking distance to eateries and even downtown (about 20 minutes). The metro station is a 5 minute walk away.  Lydia's apartment is clean and very comfortable. The bedroom is on the top floor with nice views, comfortable bed and adequate space along with a sitting room with coffee maker and small fridge.  Lydia is happy to answer questions and give advice about Stockholm."
723539,320581030,2018-09-09T00:00:00.000Z,"The place is great and charming. Location is very convenient, check-in and check-out are easy, the place is equipped with everything necessary and more, a balcony is nice. I felt really like at home here, the place has a very warm and positive atmosphere because of all details - candles, plants, light, wooden floor.
And Matheas is a very thoughtful and caring person, thanks to him a lot"
1234960,292977668,2018-07-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Jacob’s place is in a residential area but easily accessible from the centre of the city. The house has generous living, dining and kitchen areas and was very comfortable for our family of six. The downstairs double bedroom had its own bathroom which meant it was almost like a private wing which was useful for the older couple in our extended family."
581243,20266256,2014-09-26T00:00:00.000Z,We had a great time at Edwin's and really enjoyed his apartment. It is very nice and clean and Edwin was super friendly!! We highly recommend staying here :)
164448,80590681,2016-06-19T00:00:00.000Z,Incredibly gracious host. Room was great and it had all that we needed. Lidia gave us some tea and a rundown of what to visit and experience in Stockholm. So kind. Great location and place!
299154,10380102,2014-02-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Daniel was very friendly. The apartment was close to all the good thing. Shopping, eating, clubbing. We had such a nice time and would very much like to come back and stay at Daniels ! :)"
299154,80430369,2016-06-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Daniel's apartment was exactly what I needed and he made it very easy to check in and check out. The location is fantastic, bed is comfy and apartment is well appointed.

The next time I am in Stockholm, Daniel's apartment is my #1 choice for accomodation."
1205051,268540244,2018-05-25T00:00:00.000Z,"The perfect location in the city with loads of great restaurants, cafes and shops nearby. I booked the place for a work trip as it’s only a 10 min walk from my office. The flat had  everything I needed for a 11 night stay and it’s a good size for 1-2 people. The communication with Viktor prior to check in and during the stay was smooth sailing. I definitely recommend this place!"
242188,66773766,2016-03-24T00:00:00.000Z,Lidia was a great host - always there to help out if you need help with anything whatsoever. Delightful experience!
1153177,8628646,2013-11-09T00:00:00.000Z,"In the beginning of November, 2013 we had very interesting travel during a school vacation. In Stockholm my family have stopped at Terry. Terry it is very hospitable, it has very much liked my children. It was pleasant to us to stay with it."
1149820,57785580,2015-12-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Klara's apartment was nicely decorated but having a small kitchen made it hard to cook, if you are into that. The airport shuttle is near, so that is a plus point."
1271843,428475832,2019-03-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Excellent and wonderful experience at Andre’s home. The apartment and room is very clean, neat, tidy and well maintained. The location in very central, few steps from metro station which can take you to further areas. Andre is a very sweet and nice person, he was responding immediately before and during my stay. Full package of great experience. Totally recommended."
1153177,326330859,2018-09-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Lovely place! Central location and Terry was a great host from check-in to check-out. We already know the city well, but the use of his place was exactly what expected and were looking for."
1054406,523286081,2019-09-03T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a great stay at Thomas’s place as a family with a 2 year old. The apartment is spacious and well designed and had everything we needed. The cot was very comfortable and our little boy slept well. Thomas was an excellent host. He met us at the bus stop to show us to the apartment, made us feel very welcome and left a lot of groceries in the fridge, which was very much appreciated. The centre of Stockholm is easily accessible by public transport. I would highly recommend this apartment (and Stockholm in general) to anyone travelling with children."
278311,5739529,2013-07-14T00:00:00.000Z,Linnea has been a wonderful host. very caring and co-operative. I felt at home staying at her place. She took care of the breakfast everyday and offered all utensils if I wanted to cook. She is simply a nice person and a wonderful guest.
242188,247349876,2018-03-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Li is VERY knowledgeable about the city that she lives in. She gave me advice on trains and buses, and she also had about 5 map/schedules/museums/etc in English for me to use while I was there. It was a great help. She offered me tea and discussed a lot of options I had while I was there. She is a great resource.

Where I stayed was upstairs and it was all mine. There are 2 rooms that she rents out, but I was the only one at that time. There was a TV, tea kettle, fridge, and I think a microwave in the living room area that was up there. Very spacey."
1262188,87480263,2016-07-20T00:00:00.000Z,Todo perfecto
1212891,26166402,2015-02-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud was kind enough to accept my booking request even though it was for one night only. She was a very nice host, and her cats were sooo cute. The room and everything else was so neat and tidy that one could almost feel at home. The bed was quite comfortable. As I was already familiar with Stockholm, I didn't need any help but I could see she was ready to help if I did. No trouble at all arranging the arrival, either. I have only positive things to say about my visit. Thanks, Maud!"
1204621,509223455,2019-08-14T00:00:00.000Z,Sorry for my late review. I only stayed for few days but had a great time at her place. It located near the ferry terminal so which help for my plan. Would recommend everyone:)
819676,166289281,2017-07-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Andy was a great host, nice to talk to and very helpful."
164448,77640389,2016-06-02T00:00:00.000Z,Lidia made us feel very welcome. Arrival arrangements went smoothly. The room was as advertised. Lidia gave us lots of useful information about things to do and places to see. She was always keen to know what we had been doing and where we'd been throughout our stay. Altogether an enjoyable experience.
1035775,17268020,2014-08-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Magnus was a very helpful and very friendly host. His flat is nicely located in a quiet neighbourhood of central Stockholm but you can reach the city by Bus within 10-15 min.
In the flat you can find everything you need and are allowed to use it during your stay. Only the bed is quite small when you are used to a proper bed for a couple. 
Thank you very much Magnus for having us. We had a really good time at your place and fell in love with your city. :)"
1212891,45484793,2015-09-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud is the perfect host. She is full of positive energy all the time!! This has been my best experience in Airb&b. She made us felt at home from the welcome (with a wonderful smile) until the \"see you soon\". She was happy to help us always the we needed it. The house has several \"plusses\" as free shower gel, cofee, tea, herbs to cook... Etc. All the house is well-equipped and very clean. She helped us to find information about public transport, places to visit, places to buy food... Etc. I strongly recommend to stay at Maud's place. Everything was PERFECT!!!"
1124388,8254701,2013-10-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Carl was a very good host. He was waiting for us in his apartment and he gave us every detail that we asked about Stockholm. The room is very close to the center (only 12-15 minutes from central station by bus and the bus station is only a two minutes walk from the house). We had some trouble with one missing towel (only 2 for 3 persons) and some dirty sheets but when I told him, he immediately gave us what we asked. The house is small but good enough if you do not ask for too much. There was a very good music stereo that we enjoined a lot and the kitchen had everything that we wanted to prepare a breakfast. There was a table with 3 chairs and is quite spacious concerning the small house. In 30 meters distance from the house there is a supermarket if you want to buy something to eat in the house. 

P.S.: I you are planning to stay for 3 days or more, please buy the stockholm card. It might be expensive but it is worth it because the public transport is very expensive too. A single ticket costs around 4 euros. With the stockholm card you have unlimited transport and free entrance to the museums."
242188,480176960,2019-07-02T00:00:00.000Z,Li's home is cosy and comfortable with your own living area upstairs.  Everything you could possibly need is here.
838442,471309467,2019-06-17T00:00:00.000Z,Great hostel for group travel. Very pleasant and convenient.
1262188,89074707,2016-07-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Karin's place was cozy, spacious, and conveniently located! I enjoyed how bright the whole place was and the kitchen space to whip up an easy meal. She was communicative and kind!"
164448,502858754,2019-08-05T00:00:00.000Z,Li’s is a very friendly and helpful person. Her apartment is very comfortable and in a convenient location. Thank you!
954832,78179987,2016-06-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Mikael was extraordinair from the time we made the reservation. His detailed information and service was outstanding. This AirBnB is very close to stores and public transportation. The accommodations were very good with much needed washing facilities
When the weather is warm and need for cooler air you need the door open, the street noise at night is very load. This is the only negative and the only reason for not giving a higher rating.
Ear plugs or a small fan can resolve this situation. 
Mikael said that he would get a small fan."
845365,30735007,2015-04-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Very kind and easy going host and neighbors as well ! Concerned about the comfort of his guest, and ready to help them with everything they need. During my stay, he helped me a lot to get accustomed to the place. 
The location is good, 6 min walk to the metro station and supermarkets. I recommend Michael's place."
164448,46150173,2015-09-08T00:00:00.000Z,Lidia was wonderful in every way. She gave us the 'lay of the land' before we arrived (complete with $$ saving tips) and gave us a map with locations to go to once we arrived. It was like having a tour guide when ever we needed. The place is quiet and with a comfortable bed...really enjoyed our stay!!
313195,1931464,2012-08-09T00:00:00.000Z,The spirit of stockholm surrounds this apartment.  One Spacious flat with a smart selection of vintage furniture that give a warm ambience all arround the loft. Having breakfast in the fancy kitchen was another scandinavian  expererience . The quiet ambiance and the comfortable bed also added one level up to our time on the capital of Sweden . For sure We will try to come back to David's apartament
770995,176875872,2017-08-01T00:00:00.000Z,"This flat is Peter and Susanah's home that they allow guests to use.  It is in a great situation, a quiet residential area 15 minutes walk from the old city centre.  It is tastefully decorated and incredibly clean, with a fantastically equipped kitchen, and 3 comfortable bedrooms.  Peter supplied an inflatable mattress at short notice to accommodate an extra guest we had for one night.  There are supermarkets and many restaurants around the corner.  The metro is close by, and the central station (20 minutes on train from Arlanda airport) is only 10 minutes walk away.  Peter met us in person, and gave us helpful advice on the flat, local area, and Stockhom.  He was very flexible on check-in and check-out times to accommcdate our travel arrangements.  Highly recommended!"
242188,460863838,2019-05-30T00:00:00.000Z,Great option for Stockholm - a 3 minute walk to the metro or walking distance to many of Stockholm’s most interesting neighbourhoods. Li was a kind and thoughtful host and I look forward to returning!
608672,202875616,2017-10-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Karl's place is very good. It is in a lovely old apartment building right in the centre of town so is extremely convenient. The main room is a good size and very clean, and the kitchenette is handy. Karl himself was very nice."
274876,26309086,2015-02-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Emmas flat was really beautiful, greatly furnished, very clean and spacey, we felt like being home here.
The location is great, with the best bakery just across the street! 
Emma was a perfect host and we hope to come back here soon."
536283,461912134,2019-06-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Paolo's apartment was perfect for my boyfriend and my visit to Stockholm. Located in the a great neighborhood the apartment is close to amazing restaurants and bars, public transportation and also within walking distance of many of the city's sights and attractions. We loved being able to cook meals in the apartment, as well as enjoying meals out at nearby restaurants. Definitely recommend this apartment for a solo traveler or couple!"
755843,466450508,2019-06-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Thank you so much for your warm welcome! Pär is an amazing host he prepared everything for us (map of the city, fresh water, bottle of Champagne etc...) the apt was very clean and bigger than we thought! It is also well located :) We did not take the subway but we walked to the city center (20m). I definitely recommend this apt for your stay in Stockholm! Thanks again :)"
283446,2752875,2012-10-29T00:00:00.000Z,Vidhatri's place is very close to the public transit underground.  I found it to be very accessible and an easy way to explore Stockholm.  My hosts were very generous and offered to feed me more than my fill.  The room itself was a good size with a comfortable bed.  I enjoyed my stay.
556363,199882732,2017-10-03T00:00:00.000Z,"On the positive side, this apartment is modern, very cool and the location is absolutely perfect. It's right next to the train and you can access anywhere in Stockholm. There are plenty of great restaurants, shops etc right in the neighborhood. The pictures are accurate in terms of the interior and the great view.
On the other hand, there were challenges to our stay. Our host  gave very little communication before we arrived- even after trying to contact several times. We stayed 6 nights and would have liked to unpack. Unfortunately, all closets were duct taped shut, with only a few hangers on the backs of doors. We assumed those were for us, but had no real way of knowing because there was absolutely no note or communication about the apartment- just a key under the mat.
Lastly, the host left a pile of his dirty laundry covered by a towel in the bedroom. Again, we were there 6 nights...
If you're considering a place to stay, maybe the great location and cool interior would outweigh these challenges. All things considered, I wouldn't stay here again."
242188,289927505,2018-07-13T00:00:00.000Z,Li was very friendly and very helpful with any questions I had. The room was comfortable and is perfectly located in a very central location.
1251466,74272551,2016-05-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Our room in Dean's apartment was very nice, the bed was huge and really comfortable. Dean was more than accommodating, even giving us some snacks after our late arrival. After following the address we were given we ended up at a house that wasn't Dean's and wasn't under any Airbnb listing. This was not helped by the fact that we couldn't contact him because there was no wifi. Once we managed to get in contact with him it was difficult to organise our meeting at the right train station. By that time it was quite late at night, but Dean picked us up from the train station and helped us with our bags which was kind of him. Despite all of the confusion we really enjoyed our stay. The apartment was a 5min walk from the train station and it took only 15min to get to the centre of Stockholm."
916806,5080784,2013-06-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Herr Mansour ist ein sehr sympathischer und freundlicher Gastgeber, der uns alle Freiheiten gelassen hat.
Das Appartment war schön und modern eingerichtet mit einem wunderschönen Blick auf den naheliegenden See. Das Appartment  hätte nur ein bischen besser geputzt sein können bei unserer Anreise. Ansonsten war es ein sehr schöner Aufenthalt."
819676,128234282,2017-01-23T00:00:00.000Z,Sono andato con la mia ragazza a Stoccolma e abbiamo scelto di stare da Andy & Vannie.Sono stati molto gentili e disponibili. Casa in posizione spettacolare in centro a Stoccolma. Anche la casa stessa è molto bella e luminosa. Super consigliati!
1244657,76315405,2016-05-26T00:00:00.000Z,"I had an incredible and unforgettable time in Stockholm thanks to Nic and Usha.  Their place is incredibly convenient to public transportation and major attractions; inside, it is very clean and really artsy-funky.  The room is also beautiful and clean and gets lots of great light from the window.  

Nic and Usha were also the perfect hosts--extremely kind, welcoming, and helpful.  When I arrived, they showed me where the public transportation was and pointed out places I could walk to, even offering for me to join them on their walk.  The next day was Sunday, and they invited me to a lovely breakfast and told me about things that were happening around the city.  I didn't see them very much as I was usually out and about, but I definitely, absolutely recommend Nic and Usha.  I'm already thinking of when I can go back!"

Дорогие Юлия и Мансур! Отдельное огромное Вам спасибо за Вашу помощь. Ваша поддержка в ситуации, когда у меня украли паспорт за 12 часов до нашего вылета из Стокгольма, была для нас неоценима. 
Very clean and modern apartment with everything you need. We liked cozy terrace. About 20 minutes to the city centre by rented car. Mansour and Julia were very hospitable and helpful with us. Dear Mansour and Julia! Thank you very much for your help!"

299154,61060217,2016-01-31T00:00:00.000Z,"We booked Daniels apartment for a sister weekend in Stockholm. For three people this apartment is very little but absolutely sufficient. It has all you need. More important for us was the location. Gamla Stan is just a few minutes walk away. A MUST-DO is the Montäliusvägen which is also in walking distance. For breakfast we have been to the café \"Muggen\" round the corner - perfect. There are several cafés, bars, restaurants in short distance. Daniels tipps were very useful. 
It was very nice, that Daniel welcomed us personally. So we had the possibility to ask questions. Another point that was important to us was WIFI which worked perfectly.
Tack sa mycket för allt."

Maud was very easy to communicate with and also very helpful She even agreed to pay my money back on her own suggestion without beeing obligated to, which was incredebly nice of her! I can strongly recommend Maud as a host. She is a nice and considering, helpful and very realiable person!"

The location was brilliant, it was beside the bus stop, metro and tram and also there's a shopping centre beside you along with different places to eat and drink. I was running in the Stockholm marathon so getting to the expo and starting area only took me 16 mins by Meto. I can't say enough good things about Jo and her accommodation, she is a brilliant host. I totally recommend her place. I hope in the future to return there and enjoy all that Stockholm has to offer."

The location is convenient (6-7 minute walk to metro and there are restaurants and supermarkets also within a 10 minute walking distance) and Maud's organization is down to a T with her labels for designated towels, fridge space, etc. and clear directions to get to her place and house rules. Having her cat Sammy in the house also made the place feel extra cozy! Would definitely stay here again."

242188,102183651,2016-09-17T00:00:00.000Z,Lilia was extremely warm and welcoming. We had tea several times during my three days with her and she told me many stories of Sweden. This was my first Airbnb experience and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
757320,21969914,2014-10-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Estuve en el departamento de Barb 3 días. Está muy bien ubicado en sodermalm, la pieza era cómoda y limpia, y ella tuvo muy buena disposición y fue muy agradable. El ascensor estaba en reparaciones, pero los arreglos iban a estar terminados muy luego.
Me parece que es un muy buen lugar para quedarse, especialmente considerando la excelente ubicación del departamento."
1212891,167314873,2017-07-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Had a good stay here, but the place is a bit far from the city."
1182616,11848331,2014-04-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice room and balcony. Quick with responding. A little misleading in description as there were three other rooms of travelers, so it was more of a hostel than an apartment. One bathroom for 6 people was rough, and it required a lot of cleaning as the shower did not have a separate area in the bathroom (also it's not pictured). Priced adequately, just get the full story."
700113,496137418,2019-07-27T00:00:00.000Z,Very nice and clean little studio. Perfectly located right between nature and the city. Ilona is a very friendly and helpful host.

536691,498193796,2019-07-29T00:00:00.000Z,"The place was in a fantastic location and really close to a lot of lovely bars, restaurants and amenities. The house itself is wonderful and quirky and we had a lovely time staying there."
145320,468682315,2019-06-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Kim's apartment was a great hub for my son and me while we visited Stockholm. The apartment is as pictured, with a nice window opening over the street. There is a shared bathroom adjacent to the guest room where you sleep. You have access to wifi, kitchen, and the elevator is a wonderful bonus because you're up several floors!

I did not see a way to lock the guest room or the bathroom, and those are the only small things I might suggest. Certainly no criticism of the host; it's just that a lock can give the traveler some additional peace of mind. It was, to be fair, not a problem at all while we were there. So I may be overthinking this.

The neighborhood is spectacular, with many food choices nearby and convenient access to mass transit. To save money, I advise travelers to take the Pendeltåg commuter train (line 40 or 43) from the airport down to Södra station. Much less expensive than taxi or Arlanda Express, and the 45-minute train ride is comfortable.

I did not meet Kim, but Kim's daughter Irma was a wonderful host and so kind to us as we arrived and got settled. I hope to visit Stockholm again and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here in the future."

164448,520241261,2019-08-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Li is a wonderful host, very hospitable. Her place is very centrally located, close to public transport. She is always there to help in case of any questions and her tips are extremely useful for tourists. Overall we had an excellent stay at her place."
647314,5910989,2013-07-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Mallika's apartment is every bit as gorgeous as the photo's show. It is so easy to get to from the Mariatorget subway station and peaceful and quiet at night. 
The room, and the whole apartment was spotlessly clean. Lovely fresh towels were provided and the wifi (being able to surf the net seems almost as important as being able to get a good nights sleep and get clean these days!!) worked perfectly.
The location is great as there is an excellent coffee shop on the corner and it is so easy to jump on the subway to get into town if you need to but as the weather was gorgeous, I had just a very lovely short stroll to Gamla Stan. 
Mallika herself is a very lovely lady. Truely I could not have wished for a better host; friendly, knowledgeable and helpful and puts you immediately at ease. 
Really quick and excellent communication, whether it was by email or text message which made the pre-arrival experience smooth.
I've had a wonderful weekend in Stockholm, thank you Mallika and your beautiful home for being a part of it! Sarah x"

The apartment is very big, clean and functional. The shared bathroom is adequate and kitchen has everything you need. The bedroom is very large - with king size bed, couch, wardrobe and dresser. Our favourite part was the balcony - which is a great place to take in the long sunny evenings - Bonus! 

A bit of walk from the city centre - maybe about 25 minutes -  but a very good place to stay Stockholm."

I stayed at their place for 25 days and I'm very pleased with my stay - the location is great, just app 20 minutes by tube to the central station, the room is just nice - I did get the best sleep there -, perfect when looking for a nice cosy place where to work. Ea and her family they're by far the nicest, most helpful people one (as a foreigner/tourist) can wish for! 
Thank You! :)"

Communication with Annbritt in advance was clear. We didn't see Annbritt after check in but she was available by phone if we needed.

As stated in description, there  no access to kitchen (I missed a  kettle) or living room."

The location is perfect for walking all over Stockholm (so relieved I did not bring a bike, as I kept stopping everywhere,  taking photos).  It's warm and cozy—like staying in your favorite aunt's attic.  The exercise, from walking up and down the stairs, was exactly what I needed.  And two fantastic benefits:  Paradiset (healthy grocery and deli) and Legumes Vegetarian Buffet (healthy and affordable restaurant) were just around the corner and across/down around the street.  Feeling much gratitude for this location and for Annika's kindness!"
608672,7216578,2013-09-11T00:00:00.000Z,Quiet room with computer desk.   Mini kitchen and closet.  Very small bathroom with odd shower arrangement - very difficult to avoid getting water onto floor. Location is reasonably central.  Easy access to supermarket and public transit.
1182616,239534650,2018-03-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Peter is a really great host, but the stay itself was pretty bad. We weren’t told that there would be other guests in the apartment until after we had already booked and to top that off, they started having really loud sex in the next room. The walls are paper thin and you can’t even talk at regular volume without it going through the walls, let alone having loud sex or guests coming in after midnight being extremely noisy and rude. It makes sleeping and relaxing difficult. The room itself wasn’t very clean. The floor had a lot of dust and whatnot on it and it smelled strongly of smoke even though it says no smoking in the room. The bathroom reeked the entire time we were there. It was almost unbearable sometimes to use it. There was also the start of mold on the bathroom wall.  We definitely would not stay again."
1212891,52146925,2015-10-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud was very kind and helpful, the room is very cute, near to the underground and central station. I suggest that accomodation."

The food they cooked was delicious and was graciously offered more. I like the vibrant diverse neighborhood and wish I could've stayed at this airbnb the whole week rather than two days. Hospitality with a capital H."
259025,33415451,2015-05-27T00:00:00.000Z,Great stay. There were many other rooms for other visitors as well in the place. A little far from the main area but it's right next to the metro station and a bus station so it wasn't a big deal. Ali was super accomodations considering how my friend and I made this listing last minute.

700113,14465582,2014-06-20T00:00:00.000Z,"The studio of Ilona was exactly how described. We totally liked the 5 days we stayed at her place. We got a nice warm welcome from her. Everything was clean. The location of the apartment is perfect. Just a 5 minute walk to the subway-station t-bana and 2 stops to t-centalen in the city. A bus-stop is around the corner. A lot of supermarkets are in walking distance. As well as the coffeshops, restaurants and bars. We would definitely come back.
Thanks a lot. :)"

On top fanden wir einen gut gefüllten Kühlschrank und einen Obstteller vor. Marie-Louises Tochter hat zudem eine interaktive Restaurantkarte für Stockholm erfasst, welche wir mehrmals genutzt haben ohne dabei enttäuscht zu werden. Unser nächster Aufenthalt in Stockholm? Gerne wieder bei Marie-Louise!"

1170766,43568685,2015-08-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Très prévenante, notre hôtesse nous a accueilli à distance de parfaite manière. La chambre est en fait un studio tout ce qu'il y a de plus cosy. Comme il est indiqué, prévoir des masques de nuit pour les personnes qui n'arrivent pas à dormir avec la lumière du jour. Clarté très agréable. 

Very welcoming, our hostess met us at distance perfectly. The room is actually a studio that is most cozy. As noted, provide sleep masks for people who do not sleep with the light of day. We loved the brightness of the flat."

They gave the filing of been at home. They helped me with things which I had to sattle. They gave me the privacy and comfort that I like. The room is big and very comfortable with wide double bed. At night they invited me to a pizza and tea and in the morning they took care for my breakfast.  I really felt at home with their home hospitality.  Definitely a place that I will come back again.

Supermarket in the immediate area."

1182616,238175523,2018-02-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Les plus : Le logement de Peter est très bien situé, à deux minutes à pied du métro Friedemsplan et de la navette pour l’aéroport d’Arlanda. 
Plusieurs supermarchés et magasins se trouvent au pied de l’immeuble. 
Peter est très sympathique et arrangeant, même si nous ne l’avons pas rencontré. Nous avons pu laisser nos bagages dans l’appartement avant de reprendre notre à avion pour Paris. 
Les moins : l’appartement n’est pas très propre. À notre arrivée, le drap de notre lit était couvert de cheveux et poils en tous genres. Il y a de fortes odeurs de canalisations dans la salle de bains, où la poussière n’a pas été faite depuis longtemps. Les placards de la cuisine ne sont pas très propres non plus. 
Enfin, il faut bien noter que le salon de l’appartement a été transformé en chambre par Peter, ce qui n’est pas indiqué dans l’annonce. Il y a donc trois chambres qui peuvent accueillir jusqu’à 8 personnes dans l’appartement... pour une seule salle de bains, ce qui peut créer des bouchons les soirs et matins."

I met Jarl the next day and apart from preparing breakfast with the rich contents of his fridge, I was allowed to use one of hi bike cards to rent one of Stockholm's bikes for free.
Room, kitchen, bathroom and flat are in perfect shape and pleasantly located north of Östermalm district and very close to Djurgården island.

We loved the area, near to a great park for running with a lovely supermarket and an amazing bakery close by. You can walk to most parts of Stockholm from here and we found some lovely parks close by for the children. We'd definitely rent this place again. It was very clean and Terry left us milk, juice and water which was great. We even used a few of his tea bags (thanks Terry)!"

В начале был сильный запах сигарет.
В квартире есть камин как и написано в описании.
Фотографии полностью соответствуют действительности.
На кухне есть все необходимое для приготовления пищи и приветственная бутылка шампанского в холодильнике.
В спальне большая кровать и широкий диван в гостиной; два туалета: один с ванной, другой в коридоре.
Хотя хозяин не смог лично нас встретить, но приезд был организован отлично.

Several excellent bakeries and coffee houses lie within a 5-minute walk - you can even walk to Gamla Stan (the Old Town area) if you want. Li is friendly and helpful and a joy to talk with, making you feel right at home. Will definitely be my first choice when heading back to Stockholm!"

916806,4814511,2013-05-27T00:00:00.000Z,"The spacious, clean, bright and very well equipped appartment where we enjoyed our Stockhom getaway weekend! If you are looking for some solitude, romance and privacy - that is definitely the right place to stay! The surrounding nature, the proximity to the beautiful park and the spectacular view made our stay unforgettable. Travelling to the city centre is easy as long as you are prepared to spend half on hour for this. We haven't met Mansour, but Julia appeared to be a nice young lady, very welcoming and flexible in terms of check-in/check-out. The hosts stay in the same house on top floor which makes it easy to communicate if necessary.
Highly recommend this appartment to young couples who love to travel but want to feel like home in Stockholm.
Thank you, Julia and Mansour!"
1243144,5989056,2013-07-25T00:00:00.000Z,Our family of four had a wonderful time in this charming apartment. The location was perfect for exploring the city and the neighbourhood was lovely. An was an extraordinarily helpful and friendly host and we highly recommend her place.

610948,21703674,2014-10-22T00:00:00.000Z,"We just got home from spending the most amazing week in Stockholm! Lina's flat was the perfect home for us while we were there. We love to cook and took advantage of her lovely kitchen. My boyfriend and I work remotely, and her main living room area offered the perfect environment to do so. The flat is conveniently located, only a few blocks from T-Bana and all of the restaurants, bars and shopping you could want. We were able to walk into Gamla Stan as well as all of the wonderful museums that Stockholm has to offer. You also won't want to miss the MOST AMAZING view of Stockholm located on a beautiful tree-lined walkway directly across from Lina's front door!

I can't recommend Lina and her lovely home enough!"

299154,23407290,2014-11-30T00:00:00.000Z,Daniel was a perfect host. It was easy to contact him and his replies were made quickly. He made us feel welcome and was very flexible about letting us store our luggage at the apartment before check in time.  The apartment is in the perfect location for exploring Stockholm.  It is small but clean and comfortable and accommodated the four of us quite comfortably.  I would highly recommend this listing!
1261445,30983544,2015-04-30T00:00:00.000Z,"This is a lovely apartment which is very cozy and comfortable. Marie-Louise left us fruit and snacks which were very welcomed. Nicely decorated with beautiful european antiques but the apartment is nicely renovated and the kitchen modern. Though the bathroom is very small, the Stockholm shower actually works out just fine. Everything is well designed to work in the small space. I look forward to staying here again!"
536691,1805075,2012-07-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Great apartment- spacious, cozy, two balconies, cool artwork, cozy elevator, nice views, great location. What else to say? Highly recommended!"

1124388,176911613,2017-08-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Die Wohnung von Carl ist klein, aber ausreichend für zwei Personen, und sehr gemütlich. Die Lage ist einfach toll, wenn man Stockholm erkunden möchte. Lilla Essingen ist ein sehr sympathisches Quartier, von Wasser umgeben. Man ist mit dem Bus sehr schnell im Zentrum von Stockholm oder bei der nächsten U-Bahn-Station. Ein Laden, der bis 22 Uhr geöffnet hat, ist direkt vor der Haustür. Auch die Fußwege ins Stadtzentrum oder von dort zurück entlang dem Mälarensee sind sehr schön und nicht zu weit. 
Carl war sehr freundlich und verlässlich und hat sich rührend um unsere Bedürfnisse gekümmert. Er gab uns auch wichtige und gute Tipps zu Verkehrsverbindungen, Sehenswürdigkeiten und guten Lokalen in Stockholm. Sehr empfehlenswerte Adresse!"
1248490,506879456,2019-08-11T00:00:00.000Z,"We do really recommend Maria's house. She is a wonderful host, always trying to help and to suggest things to do, in the city, helping with everything you may need when visting a new city. Her house is fantastic as well and you really feel confortable as you were in your home."

Great location, comfortable bed and private bathroom just across the hallway. Really impressed that they list such a nice apartment on Airbnb- it’s great value. They even left out some snacks and fruit which was really thoughtful. Great location for Sodermalm, highly recommend!"
608672,14559553,2014-06-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Karl was such a great host! Super easy to communicate with and thorough in all responses - which was much appreciated. His wife was also very lovely to meet during our check in. The place itself was perfect! Spacious enough for two and has everything you need. We appreciated the pastries, fruit and water that was left for us. Location was also very central - close to the main city areas within Stockholm."
1251466,63070140,2016-02-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Dean was a very good host and helped us get settled in. He was kind enough to let us know and showed where to shop and how to get to the metro station. The apartment was also  good for the price in Stockholm. Though far from the city centre, its close to the metro station and takes just 30 minutes to reach City centre."
1248490,17747637,2014-08-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Maria ci ha accolto in casa in modo molto cortese e caloroso. Ci ha illustrato la casa, i collegamenti con il centro città e ci ha lasciato una quantità di mappe e depliant per visitare tutte le principali attrazioni di Stoccolma. E' stata così gentile da lasciarci anche alcune cose da mangiare. La descrizione della casa non le rende giustizia, è davvero uno splendido appartamento con tutto quanto necessario. Noi eravamo 5 adulti e abbiamo soggiornato in tutta comodità. Il quartiere è tranquillo e con tutto quanto può servire: mezzi pubblici, supermarket, ristoranti... In pochi minuti si raggiunge il centro storico con bus e metropolitana."
1212891,26230437,2015-02-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud tried really everything to let me feel welcome. Everything was indeed well described and clear to me. The flat was clean and cosy and my room was exact how she described it in her profile. Maud is also a very helpful person, so she let me know that I can ask her everything at any time. Since I was working the whole day during my stay, it is important to stress that I slept very well (calm house/area, comfortable bed). I can recommend this place. Thanks for everything and hope to see you again, Maud! Best wishes // anja"
1149820,292996725,2018-07-19T00:00:00.000Z,"A wonderful stay! As many (and the description) have said this place is very small, but it's beautifully decorated and so airy that it never felt cramped - but I could imagine it being a bit tight if there were two people. The kitchen is small and there's only a half-sized fridge but has all the amenities you could need. Loved my stay!"
608672,69193287,2016-04-10T00:00:00.000Z,"We really loved our stay at Karl's studio flat. Karl has been an excellent host. He showed us around the studio flat, provided extra towels for our little one and was very friendly and helpful. The studio flat itself was clean and comfortable and its location superb as it's literally in the heart of Stockholm. Highly recommended!"
1212891,17951341,2014-08-19T00:00:00.000Z,"We only stayed with Maud one night, but it was everything we needed. Maud is a very warm, friendly and welcoming host, which makes it a pleasure to be her guest."

755843,478938382,2019-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Pär’s home was wonderful! I stayed with my 3 friends and we had no complaints. Pär was there to greet us when we arrived and he showed us around the apartment and told us how everything worked from the beds to transportation etc. The apartment was situated in a nice area but it was still close to the center. Altogether, we had a nice visit and would recommend!"

242188,92078066,2016-08-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia is super nice. I arrived late in the night but Lidia was waiting for me. check in and check out is quite easy and location is nice which takes you only 15 mins to the downtown by train. Single room is small but it is nice for one person to stay in short period. Besides, the shared bathroom and living space is quite good. Overall, i would highly recommend!"
299154,307343063,2018-08-14T00:00:00.000Z,"위치가 정말 좋아요!

242188,1662560,2012-07-09T00:00:00.000Z,"I thoroughly enjoyed my short time in Stockholm and the great acccommodation provided by Lidia contributed massively to this. Her flat is comfortable, in a superb location and her breakfasts lived up to all the rave reviews I had read. (The breakfast chats were also enjoyable). Lidia is extremely welcoming, and keen for you to have the best experience of this wonderful city. I am an independent type of traveller and the best thing about staying with Lidia is that she is really attentative but not in the least intrusive - just the perfect mix. Can't recommend it enough. Thank you Lidia."
1096827,85661393,2016-07-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Anita´s flat is wonderful! It is very spacious, light and the bed is very comfy. The flat is equipped with everything you might need: towels, breakfast, soda stream, scissors, pots, pans, glasses, cutlery, etc. The location of the apartment is also pretty good. It´s a less than 5 minute walk away from the metro station of Sandsborg. The area is very peaceful and relaxed. Very nice neighbours, too! :)
However, the check-in and check-out turned out to be a bit tricky. We chose this place because the check-in and check-out times were listed as \"flexible\". Initially, we booked 4 nights at Anita´s place, but ended up spending only 3 nights because the check-in time (12.30am because our flight got in so late) did not suit the host. We were planning to check out around 4/5pm, but also this time was not suitable. So we ended up checking out in the morning and storing our luggage at Centralstation which costs 90SEK."
819676,164927818,2017-06-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Beautiful flat as shown on the photos and on top floor so very calm also.
It is located north of Solderman right next to a nice pub \"Oliver Twist\".
So everything especially Gamlan Stan area is walking distance from here :-)
Vannie & Andy were great host and I highly recommended this B&B!!
Thank you Andy for bring me to Omnipollo to taste good craft beer & pizza ;-)"

Insgesamt sehr freundliche und schnelle Kommunikation. Unsere Übernachtung dort hat uns sehr gefallen."
608672,150443216,2017-05-08T00:00:00.000Z,Located in a great location to be able to explore central Stockholm. Close to just about everything. Bathroom/shower were a bit small and took some getting used to.

Busstops are around the corner but we did almost everything by food because nothing is far away.
We would recommend Emma's place!"
1149820,51082547,2015-10-17T00:00:00.000Z,"We had such a lovely time at Klara's apartment, it is just like the photos, cosy & clean and light. The area is ace. Lots of cafes,restaurants  and bars. A few minutes walk to Hornstull station, where there is a supermarket and other shops,  and from there you can get to pretty much anywhere in a few minutes, we didn't use the t-bana much and instead walked and explored. It's a really gorgeous walk from the apartment to the old town by the river, and after having a few drinks in some great bars in 'SoFo' we would walk back to the apartment from there too.

Klara always responded promptly to any questions we had and we felt really welcome, her tips for the area were great, had cinnamon buns for breakfast every morning I was there! Delicious!

Tack!"

He went out of his way to make sure we knew how to get to his place, and then graciously provided us with two bikes with which we were able to explore Stockholm (and avoid paying for public transit or crazy expensive bike rentals in the city!). 

Michael let us use his kitchen, and even offered us some delicious homemade soup.  He so sweetly offered to take us to his laundry room so we could do laundry.  Annnnd he entertained us the entire stay with us interesting banter.  Coolest host ever!"

Be aware of the drain pump that is used so aboud throwing anything into the WC and get used to the sound when it is draining (can be loud if someone uses it at night). Unfortunately we didnt make it to the lake but it sure looked beautiful from the distance. There are supermarkets and a great mall in a walking distance which we liked very much.

It is cosy, bright and clean and has everything you need, such as coffee for the coffee machine or a nice smelling shampoo. The location is perfect, central but very quiet at night. Mikael was a wonderful host. He waited for us outside the flat and gave us lots of tips about Stockholm. We also brought our 7 month old daughter and that was not a problem at all. Mikael provided a cot and she slept through all the nights we stayed!! In case we come back to Stockholm we would certainly stay with him again and thus can fully recommend this apartment!"
1182616,130901662,2017-02-09T00:00:00.000Z,The location is good with easy access to local shops and restaurants. The room itself is cool and cozy.

By the gorgeous view from the windows and balcony, the area is widened perfectly. The supermarket is 5-6 minutes away by walk and so the subway/bus stations. Ilona was very kind and thoughtful to provide us with the usefull baby equipments (baby crib with the cover set, feeding chair, bib etc.). Our trip was perfect with the help of this nice place."

242188,148560519,2017-05-01T00:00:00.000Z,I found Lidia's place to be a great component of my trip to Stockholm. It is close to public transportation for easy access to the rest of the city. I found the surrounding neighborhood peaceful. Lidia made the process of getting from Arlanda to her place very easy by providing directions prior to my stay – I really appreciated that.
1251466,7571571,2013-09-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Dean and his wife were very helpful in everything. He quickly responded to everything we need to know. The accommodation is  very close to beautiful park with lake and it was very fast to go to the centre of Stockholm. Thanks, Dean :)"
242188,343583752,2018-11-01T00:00:00.000Z,Li is a very friendly host who has  great knowledge about sights and attractions. Her tips are very helpful. Her place is located in a very convenient area. Close to both the Commuter Train station and subway station. The neighborhood is very nice and idyllic. The check-in was super easy. The rooms in her place are absolutely superb for their prices. The whole apartment feels well organized and cozy. The room has nice decorations and the linens are always nice and clean. Her apartment has a very good laundry room but you will need her help to gain access to the laundry room. Overall Li’s place is probably one of the best places I have stayed and I definitely will recommend this place to anyone who wants to visit  the busy Stockholm but also wants to stay at a quite and nice place.

Hun var god til at give tips og ville gerne snakke om aktuelle svenske emner.

Soveværelset var stort, rummeligt og farverigt med en god seng.

She provided me with every information to get easy to her apartment. When I arrived, Lotta welcomed me very warm and had a lot of advices for sightseeings, do's and don't do's (how to avoid all the big tourist groups :-)) and restaurants for me. So that I didn't feel like a tourist. The room is very cosy, clean and after a day full of sightseeing you can feel very comfortable. 
If you have any questions while you stay there, you can contact Lotta by a text and she answers immediately.

To conclude, I can highly recommend to stay in Lotta's apartment."

1244357,97217008,2016-08-26T00:00:00.000Z,"I only have good things to say about Elliott and Rebecca's apartment and the services they provide.
The property is exactly as it looked in the listing. It is not a lrage apartment but we knew that coming in. Elliott provided us with 2 comfortable floor mattresses for our children and they were quite happy with them.
They gave us a very detailed instruction booklet with everything we needed to know about the apartment itself, plus a comprehensive guide about the area and accessibility to the city. The location is great. Just outside the city centre with trains and busses making it easy to get to.
We had a car for part of the time and parking wasn't the easiest experience. I noticed before our arrival that there is a Avis/Budget office in the building next door so i booked our rental car from them which made it easy to pick up and return.
All in all we had a great trip!"
1212891,274012860,2018-06-08T00:00:00.000Z,"The host is very hospitality and cleanliness. She tries to satisfy you from the smallness. The kitchen is perfect with many spice such as oil, rice, sauce... The apartment is 450m from the metro and near the supermarket."

Andre had prepared a document that provided ample information about getting around, and to the apartment. It also has many recommendations of things to do/eat as well! That was really helpful! :)

The apartment is clean and very spacious. Its location is quiet and not too densely populated - which makes it nice and relaxing. :) It was easy to get around too with the metro station just a 2 minute walk away from the apartment. 

I would recommend this listing, as well as Andre and Johanna as hosts. It was lovely having stayed and met with them! Thank you!"

1212891,32450836,2015-05-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Hi all, my wife and i spent a fantastic 4 nights at Mauds in Stockholm. 
The site really says it all : it's a very nice place and Maud is a very nice lady !
We had the best of times, we felt really welcome, and felt very much at home from the first minute.
We're cat people, that helps of course, and i must say the cats are two real beauties, very sociable, and wander around freely, but are never a nuisance and are strictly kept out of the bedroom.
Maud is a a great source of information about the city and the 'Swedish way of life', very easygoing, and a lovely lady and i'm sure we'll meet again!
The place is cosy, very clean and well-organised, you can tell Maud is not new at the travellers scene !
I especially want to mention the well-equipped kitchen ( we cooked dinner every night - there's a small 'Coop'- and a big 'Maxi'-supermarket within walking distance ).
The apartment is 7 stops ( 15 min ) from the 'T-Central'-Subway/Train/Bus-stations and a five-minute walk from the Tunnelbana-Metro-Stop. 
The only reason not to book at Mauds would be a cat allergy. Greetings from Bruges Belgium !
Heidi & Lode"

Robert is a formidable host and was extremely attentive to details, from the first communication to his friendly greeting upon our arrival.  The apartment was spotless, tastefully decorated and comfortable, exactly as per the listing, and Robert had provided us with everything we could possibly require.  The neighbourhood is vibrant and full of life (especially on the weekends), and a great location from which to explore Stockholm (either on foot or by subway, with a station within 2 minutes).  Highly recommended!"

The area in Stora Essingen was fairly quiet and it seemed like a nice neighbourhood. There is a play ground and a little wading pool for the kids nearby and crocery store not too far away. Even a beach is within a walking distance. You can reach the city easily by a bus or by a tram/subway."

His house is charming. We usually love to be on the go but his place was so inviting we stayed at the house a bit more than usual. It was easy to save $ on breakfast by cooking at home. For location- I liked not staying in the main area of Stockholm. His house is a five minute walk to the metro and @ a 10 minute ride into the city. His house is a five minute walk to a grocery and a few resturants. It is residential. We have 7 year old kids who loved having their own spaces and a trampoline."

Karl, il proprietario, parla un ottimo italiano ed è stato molto gentile e disponibile, fornendoci anche informazioni su come muoverci e cosa fare  in città. L'appartamento è costituito da una stanza con letto matrimoniale, scrivania e poltroncina, un bagnetto e un piccolo locale adibito a cucina. Qui non è possibile cucinare, ma sono presenti un frigo, una caffetteria e un microonde. Unica nota il bagno, la doccia da direttamente sul lavandino ed è praticamente impossibile non allagare tutto. Karl ci ha tuttavia informato che a breve (l'edificio è piuttosto antico e per fare lavoretti di ammodernamento deve aspettare le necessarie autorizzazioni) il bagno sarà rifatto e la doccia sarà spostata dalla posizione attuale."

The studio was very nice, clean, located in a quiet area with grocery stores around the corner. They really provided everything (towels as much as we wanted, shower gels, tooth-brushes, coffee caps, maps and information about Stockholm,…never seen that before). Mikael was very helpful, easy and fast to communicate with and he respected our privacy. This was our third Airbnb-experience, but the best so far. We really recommend this place, very good value for money! And for the fitness-addicts: there is a free fitness-room + sauna in the basement. Not that we had time for that, to busy having fika! :-)"

Shop closeby, 3 bedrooms , dishwasher, everything you need for a comfortable stay in stockholm

1 bathroom is perhaps a downside when youre with more people but you can organise around that.

Emma is very accomodating and a fast communicator. 

The outside terrass was a nice bonus that we used quit a lot"

The beds were very comfortable and we were very impressed with the instant hot water in the kitchen for coffee, tea and cooking! The apartment is close to local amenities and we actually took a nice walk right into the centre of Stockholm. The only thing I think worth mentioning is that there are cameras in the kitchen area and the bedroom with the bunk beds. This was fine with us although my daughters were staying in the bedroom with the bunk beds and felt uneasy when getting undressed so we covered the camera at times but then uncovered when we left. The apartment looks much more fabulous in real life than in the pictures so we were really pleasantly surprised when we arrived. 
Overall we really enjoyed our stay and would love to stay again should we return to Stockholm in the future! Thanks for having us!"

He spent time with my daughter and I when we first arrived, going through housekeeping issues, showing us how things worked, taking us through a map of Stockholm and suggesting what we could do. He was very welcoming and gave really clear instructions on how to find the apartment from the airport.  He even met us on the street to guide us in.  He provided my daughter with colouring pens and papers and a soft toy that she could take home, which she has called Princess.  The apartment was really clean and well organised and already had lots of essential things that we were able to use.  Very cosy just for two.  I would highly recommend it to anyone."

Le logement est confortable, douillet et propre. Il est plein d'ondes positives, très zen et avec une belle décoration et des plantes. Il y a un salon avec un matelas confortable au sol, avec un balcon au calme. La cuisine est pratique, avec frigo, gazinière, petite cafetière Bodum et bouilloire. On peut manger dans la cuisine sur la table basse. La petite salle de beau contient une baignoire, un lavabo et un WC. Il y a Internet Wifi et chaine Hifi.
Le logement est au calme, ce qui est très agréable. La ligne de métro est à moins de 10 minutes à pied, les salles de concert Globen et Tele2Arena sont  à 10 minutes à pied. C'est très bien pour visiter Stockholm.
On peut faire ses courses juste en face à l'épicerie Tempo (un peu cher), sinon au ICA du centre commercial Globen (10 min).
Je remercie Annika pour sa confiance, son hospitalité et ses précieux conseils, même si nous n'avons pas eu la chance de nous voir, nous avons communiqué par message."

We even got bicycles to drive to the lake wich is near by. My friend and I went to Stockholm to learn a bit the language and culture and Anna helped us to learn these things. We said that we would try to speak swedish with her and so she spoke swedish with us, even slowly so we could understand better. When we had questions we could just go to her.

The place itself is nice and cozy and very convenient as far as location. It's less than a 10 minute walk to old Town and approximately 15 minute walk to the river where a lot of the cruises depart from. Plenty of bars and places to eat around the apartment and close to public transportation. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend Daniel as a host.
1170766,164981004,2017-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,It was fantastic! The cosy apartment in beautiful Södermalm is quiet and near town at the same time. Annika is a wonderful host - very kind and helpful. Also the communication worked perfectly. I would highly recommend to enjoy this magnificent city staying at Kattgränd!

Isabelle & Dan were very welcoming, friendly,  kind and AWSOME people! They definitely made me feel like a proper Swede on the first night!  and were full of useful information about Sweden and Stockholm. They definitely has made my visit a memorable one! :-)

Would definitely stay there again for a trip in the summer!  And recommend to anyone who wants to live and see the real Stockholm :-)

Thanks again guys!

I felt right at home in Lina and Marcus's wonderful flat. They are very involved in their city, are well traveled and connected. If you get a chance to stay with them, take the chance to appreciate their wonderful aesthetic and fun conversation. Thanks for hosting me, Lina and Marcus!"
1124388,33796696,2015-06-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Well, overall we had a great time at Carl`s place. Although we were three people staying at the slightly smaller apartment, all our needs were met. Carl is a great host, he welcomed us at the apartment had a drink with us and gave a lot of tips with places we might consider visiting both during day and night. Hygiene and cleanness was on a high level. When it comes to its location, the apartment is slightly off the main party/busy area of Stockholm but there is always good public transport connections. Overall, Carl`s apartment is highly recommended."
819676,220641338,2017-12-23T00:00:00.000Z,The place is beautiful and in a really good location. The room and bathroom are spacious and spotless.

You will not regret staying here!!

You share with others who were all very nice. Peter responds to all text messages very quickly.  Our room had the balcony which was very nice.
The kitchen to share is very well equipped. 
We met Peter he is very nice. Comes in every day to do clean."

We also loved the big kitchen for cooking and storing groceries :) Margareta was very helpful, picked us up from the Central station on our first day and also drove us to the Central station on our last day. She showed us everything about how to use the public transport system, how to find food restaurants and how to enjoy ourselves in Sköndal and Stockholm. She was always concerned to find the right answer to all our questions and to cater for our needs (we could use her bikes, we could wash our clothes, etc.). We recommend her place and her hospitality 100 percent."
1128990,505460214,2019-08-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Anette Yvonne's place in Södermalm is perfectly located and she is a perfect host. We had a nice - for me first - time in Stockholm and enjoyed this diverse neighbourhood. 
Recommended for everyone!"

Before I came I was worries that room would be cold because it is mostly windows but I was wrong. Room was nicely warm even though there was snow outside. Marcelo kept apartment really clean. Location is superb - only few minutes walk to metro station, buss station and nearest shopping center. I can highly recommend. Compared to other listings in Stockholm this was good quality for the money."

Leiligheten er lys og fin, og har det man trenger for et komfortabelt opphold. Den ligger i et avskjermet område, kort vei til butikker, restauranter og T-bane. Monteliusvägen ligger et steinkast unna, anbefaler en tur her! Alt i alt er vi svært fornøyde med Annika, leiligheten og Stockholm."
916806,5229570,2013-06-19T00:00:00.000Z,"The flat is very good, very clean, everything is brand new. Mansour was fantastic as a host, collected us and took us back to metro station on arrival and departure with his car, because of our luggage.
The only problem is the distance, the flat is very far from the center, and 10 minutes walk from the metro station, which is not clear in airbnb page."

530454,519431679,2019-08-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Really fascinated by the tour created by Welly! He told a lot from history, but in an easy and funny way, so that it did not sound like a boring history lesson but like an exciting story. Many secret spots have been shown and the secrets of Paris revealed. You'll fall in love with the city even more after the 3h evening tour with Welly! I loved the way he told the jokes and showed some street art on the way, we talked about life in Paris and France in general, that has been awesome. And the group was not big, very nice people. The view of Paris from the rooftops is breathtaking! Unforgettable, the next time in Paris will surely try one more tour by Welly! Recommended!!!"

1205051,16907786,2014-08-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Viktor was really welcoming and was even able to host me a few hours before schedule. He had everything you need to cook, and he's happy to share it. His flat is amazing, bright, REALLY CLEAN, conmfy and stuff. If it wasn't so big, I would have stolen this bed. It's the best I've ever sleept in! I was a bit reluctant about the price at first, but when I was in there, I knew that it was really cheap compared to Stockholm standard. 
Go for it!"

916806,17202106,2014-08-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Het contact met Mansour was goed en prettig. Hoewel het appartement kleiner is dan de foto's doen vermoeden (meest geschikt voor twee personen vinden we, gezien de ene open ruimte) en het 'main terrass' van de uitzichtsfoto niet bij het appartement hoort, is de prijs/kwaliteit verhouding prima in orde. Een net en compleet appartement, een mooie locatie en Stockholm is goed te bereizen."

There is a shopping centre right next to the apartment, which is great for buying anything from food (supermarket & restaurants) to cloths, etc. 

The apartment itself is very clean, and so is the room. The bed is very comfortable and the room is bright, making it easy to get up in the morning for exploring the city.

Pär was very guestfree and had set a bottle of champagne in the fridge for us and let us use all tea, coffee, ketchup etc. that were om the cabinnets.

The apartment is newly renovated and the kitchen is fully equipped with anything thats needed. 
It is located a bit outside of the city center, but is easily to reach with public transportation (20min subway ride, 10min walk to the apartment itself). By arriving without a car, i can recommend to take the bus from the subway station instead of walking with the luggage because its going quiet uphill."

Marie's place is great. Really comfy. In the kitchen there are all neccessary things. In the apartment there is a lot of plants which adds extra charm. No insects ! as i read in some mean comment here. Cat which will stay with you when Marie will be off is really sweet and he loves all people from first sight ( what was strange for me as cats usually don't like strangers:) ) Apartament is close to the subway and bus station. Next to the metro station ( so 4 min of walk) there are shops, cafes and similar places.  And communcation with Marie is really great-  on airbnb and via telephone.

We felt like we were at home and Emma even left us on the table some traditional wine. We really enjoyed the wireless sound system as well!

Madeline was very responsive and the check-in process was very smooth. Our only issue was the curtains in the bedrooms didn't do a very good job blocking the sunlight ... Near midsummer in Sweden that's a bit of a problem lol. If you're staying here in the summer I'd recommend bringing some eyemasks!

Close by feet to everything, very easy to go to Stockholm (15min by metro).he sea and the woods are close and beautiful with all the snow. We warmly recommand it."

1117037,457964986,2019-05-25T00:00:00.000Z,"I would highly recommend staying at Polina’s apartment in Stockholm. I had an amazing experience! Polina was always quick to respond and she provided lots of local recommendations. Check-in was flexible. The apartment was clean, spacious, and just a couple minutes away from the metro. As a solo female traveler, I always felt safe in the apartment and surrounding area. I hope to stay here again during my next visit!"

1204621,155967713,2017-05-29T00:00:00.000Z,"I had a great experience staying at Nettan's place. The room is spacious and clean and I found the location to be ideal--in a quiet neighborhood but only 5 minutes from the subway station.

Nettan herself is very kind and offered me tips on places to visit within Stockholm. And a small gesture which I appreciated--one night I didn't get home until late, and Nettan had left the light on near the entryway so that I could see when I entered. Very thoughtful!"
1054406,364694533,2018-12-31T00:00:00.000Z,"This was exactly what we were looking for, a homely place to call our own in an inner city neighbourhood in Stockholm. The apartment was clean, spacious and private. Thomas was a superhost, providing great local tips and even drove us to a local store to buy groceries on our first night. There was a lovely surprise of bread, juice, milk and lots of other little extras waiting for us and Thomas even let my daughter feed his pet rabbits. Can not recommend this place more. Easy transport into Stockholm and the lake was beautiful for a morning walk. Was wonderful. We would love to come back one day."

The room was spacious and comfortable. I would clarify that the 16 minutes to the city center refers only to the time on the train. You have to walk 5 minutes to the station and if you miss a train, as I did, you may have to wait about 10 minutes for the next."
1041103,19864886,2014-09-20T00:00:00.000Z,"My girlfriends and I had a wonderful stay at Karoline's apartment. It was spacious, clean and situated 3 minutes from the metro which was very important to us. We didn't need her often after we got settled in but on the two occasions that we did request something she immediately responded in a helpful manner. The beds were comfortable and the kitchen though small by our standards produced some great meals. I would say that the only downside at all might have been the noise. It is situated on a busy street and since the weather was so amazing while we were there we left the windows open allowing the street noise to come in, though that wasn't really a problem at all. The neighbor hood was very nice too. We would definitely stay there again!"
299154,520250480,2019-08-30T00:00:00.000Z,Very comfortable apartment in an excellent location. Like most flats in Stockholm it is small but was perfectly fine for 2 people + a baby. Check in was very easy using a keysafe and having Netflix on a massive TV was a plus. Thanks for a great stay.
897730,192461358,2017-09-10T00:00:00.000Z,We had an amazing time in Stockholm. The flat is beautiful and well placed. It's close from the metro station and the city center. The flat has everything you need.
1212891,31636515,2015-05-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud ist eine ganz wundervolle Gastgeberin! Sie hat mich vorab schon mit zahlreichen Informationen versorgt, auf das aktuelle Wetter hingewiesen und mir entsprechende Kleidung angeboten... Ich habe sie als stets freundlichen und hilfsbereiten Menschen kennengelernt, darüber hinaus hat sie aber auch eine tolle Persönlichkeit, immer gut gelaunt, ich habe zum ersten Mal einen grünen Smoothie probiert, etwas über Yoga gelernt... wer also Ansprache wünscht, bekommt diese auch, genauso kann man sich aber auch in sein Zimmer zurückziehen. Das Zimmer/die Wohnung sind genau wie beschrieben, alles gemütlich und sehr sauber und gepflegt! Ich konnte in der Küche alles mitbenutzen, Tee und Kochbasics sind vorhanden, zum Empfang hatte Maud gleich eine Tasse Kaffee für mich bereitet. Badzimmer wird geteilt nach Absprache, alles klappte total problemlos. Die Wohnung liegt sehr gut, nach ca. 300m ist man am Wasser, dort gibt es auch ein schönes Restaurant, man kann auch super schön am Wasser spazieren gehen. Ein großer Supermarkt und mehrere Restaurants / Bars sind im Radius von ca. 400m zu erreichen, in ungefähr gleicher Entfernung liegt die U-Bahn mit direkter Anbindung ins Zentrum ( 5 Haltestellen waren es glaube ich bis T-Centralen ). Ich würde jederzeit wieder bei Maud wohnen, ganz lieben Dank nochmal für die Gastfreundschaft!!! (Website hidden by Airbnb)"

442837,100414218,2016-09-09T00:00:00.000Z,Great place to stay!! Close to the city yet plenty of  parks around as well. Jo was very responsive in getting back with me and worked with me to make my checkin/checkout times work.
541875,6659729,2013-08-20T00:00:00.000Z,"I spent five days at Martin's appartment in Stockholm in mid August 2013. I chose it because the price was reasonable, the location was ideal (I was attending a conference at the Swedish Film Institute which is close by), and because the pictures made it look homey an d comfortable. I was not disappointed! Martin was a responsive correspondent, and a charming host, even when I arrived after midnight due to a delayed flight. The flat is exactly what it seems to be: I found the bed very comfortable, and everything worked perfectly. The street outside is very quiet. I didn't get much chance to visit Stockholm, but when I did walk into town for a reception, it only took me 15 minutes. There are several restaurants/cafés within a block or two, plus a 7-11 and there is also a big mall (which I did not investigate). This would be an ideal pied-a-terre for one or two people who want to visit the city, but retreat somewhere quieter in the evening. I would not hesitate to book it again."
242188,168207960,2017-07-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia, la anfitriona, me facilitó información detalladísima sobre cómo llegar desde el aeropuerto al apartamento, e incluso me estaba esperando en la puerta por temor a que no lo encontrara y pasara de largo. Me recibió con un té y mapas para facilitarme cualquier información sobre transportes, museos,   etc. que necesitara. El día de mi partida había alteraciones en el servicio ferroviario y también me ayudó a encontrar la mejor combinación para llegar al aeropuerto. 

El apartamento está muy bien ubicado cerca de varias estaciones de metro y paradas de autobús, muy cerca del centro histórico, a donde se puede llegar caminando o con el metro (a una estación de distancia).

El apartamento es silencioso, luminoso y amplio, y dispone de todo lo necesario para comer allí con comodidad (nevera, calentador de agua, utensilios de mesa, etc.). También hay varios supermercados cercanos donde se puede comprar comida.

Si vuelvo a Estocolmo, me gustaría volver a alojarme aquí sin ninguna duda."

608672,403030027,2019-01-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Karl's room is just excellent for a quick trip to the city. I reckon it must be hard to find a better location (10 min walk from Tcentralen, 15-20 min walk from gamla Stan, with underground and buses connecting you to any point of the city). The area is full of supermarkets and convenience shops, cafes, pubs and restaurants so you will be sorted out for the whole trip. The place is small and set up like a hotel room, but elegantly decorated and the finishes are very nice. The room was very warm and comfortable, and the bed is a delight. There's no cooking facilities but you have a microwave, coffee maker and a small fridge. Also the host let some coffee, tea, water and snacks ready for me, very thoughtful. Also they didn't care and waited for me since I arrived beyond midnight to do my check in Only con of this flat would be the shower: is very messy and it takes you a while after to clean the bathroom, but I guess that's just the only way to make it fit, and once again is nothing major. Karl's place is just excellent if it's your first time in Stockholm and you're looking for making your trip easy going. Definitely would repeat."

The apartment is in an amazing location in Stockholm, walking distance to great restaurants, cafes, stores and all forms of public transportation.  Seta met us upon our arrival and made sure that we had everything we needed.  She checked in with us during our stay to confirm that all was going well.  The apartment was bright, spacious, and beautiful.  It was the perfect home base for our week in Stockholm. We especially appreciated the large kitchen and bathrooms.

Мы не испытывали никаких затруднений с проживанием (включая check-in in и check-out, магазины, рестораны и т.д.).

The location is quiet but very close to transportation and basic shopping. Diana was out of town when I arrived so I was greeted by her mother, who showed me around the apartment. The kitchen was stocked with some basics including, coffee, bread, margarine, cheese, and milk. Diana checked in with me to see how things were going around the middle of the week.
