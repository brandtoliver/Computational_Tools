1244657,115895767,2016-11-27T00:00:00.000Z,"He pasado una semana maravillosa en casa de Usha y Nic. El ambiente en el hogar es muy tranquilo, encantador. Ambos me han ayudado en lo que he necesitado desde el primer momento, me han hecho sentir como en casa. El apartamento está situado en una zona estupenda, muy céntrica, está muy bien comunicado, tanto si necesitas transporte público como si quieres desplazarte paseando. Tendré un recuerdo precioso de mis días en Estocolmo con Nic y Usha. Os recomiendo esta casa :)"
608672,315267128,2018-08-28T00:00:00.000Z,Wonderful central location. Clean studio with many amenities. Quiet and safe area yet just a few blocks away from all the fun. Really enjoyed our stay and would recommend.

299154,67697695,2016-03-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Daniel was very communicative and friendly. It was easy to get to the apartment, and getting the keys was very smooth. The balcony was a nice place to kill some time, and the WiFi is indeed quite fast. The kitchen and bathroom were both uncomfortably dingy, but perhaps there wasn't enough time to take care after the previous guests."
1248490,26251768,2015-02-08T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a lovely weekend at Maria's apartment. Maria' is very flexible and the flat was perfect for us (we were 6 friends). Great location, there are nice restaurants and shops nearby. Maria's apartment is very beautiful and it has everything you need. I can warmly recommend this to everyone!"
1204621,36721013,2015-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,The room is very nice and cosy. I felt at home and slept well. Overall I had a nice experience.
944703,18966868,2014-09-03T00:00:00.000Z,L appart est tres bien entretenu. Nous avons dormi a 3 sans probleme. Christina est tres accueillante sans etre envahissante. Il n y a pas grand chose dans le quartier mais le metro est a 50 metres donc tres facile de se deplacer dans la ville.
1204621,196877922,2017-09-24T00:00:00.000Z,Mycket trevligt! Rent fräscht och perfekt utrustat rum. Skön säng och fin utsikt. Behaglig upplevelse rakt igenom. Nettan är mycket tillmötesgående.

We loved to stay here !"
620848,4658992,2013-05-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Hannah is a warm friendly person. She  communicated well with us before arrival but unfortunately we did not see her communication due to internet problems. However she was waiting for us when we reached and gave us detailed information about the apartment, city and neighbourhood. I have yet to see someone so thoughtful of the guests' needs thatn this couple. They had everything down to socks, gloves and umbrellas! The apartment was neat, spacious and comfortable.  They were large hearted enough to have the fridge full . We enjoyed Stockholmn thanks to Hanna's detailed brief . We mwet Keith on our way out. He was equally generous and warm. A big thank you'for making our visit memorable. The apartment is well located and easily reached by train and buses. We didn't miss a car at all."
1137050,31080977,2015-05-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Gabriel is an excellent host and his place is very well-situated in Sodermalm, very close to many excellent restaurants and bars and even a great record store.
He was gracious enough to accommodate my last-minute request and he was very prompt with his replies. We had a nice but brief chat when I arrived at his place and he checked up on me after the first night to make sure everything was going well.
I definitely got the sense that he loves the area he lives in and gave me some great ideas about where to eat and what to see. He's extremely knowledgable about Stockholm and a very interesting, well-traveled person. The flat is decorated in a very unique and cool way. The curios cabinet in the bedroom was a bit strange to get used to at first, but the lovely bedroom balcony made up for it. 
I didn't spend much time in the flat, as I was out exploring Stockholm or hanging out in Sodermalm bars.
I enjoyed my stay at Gabriel's flat and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to stay in a hip area, not far from historical Gamla Stan."
757320,32526712,2015-05-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Barb was home to meet us, and we got good instructions how to get there a couple of days before our travel. The room is in a great location, and nice and clean. We had a great stay in Stockholm and I can recommend Barb for future visitors"
581243,81333684,2016-06-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin's place was very comfortable and neat. He was also welcoming when we arrived. Overall, I would recommend this place to other people"
763407,5539825,2013-07-05T00:00:00.000Z,"My family (husband and two young daughters) had a fantastic stay at Gabriella's beautiful and spacious flat.  The pictures do not do this amazing apartment justice--it is very large and modern with every comfort of home including an induction cooktop, dishwasher, washing machine, and heated tile floors in the bathroom.  The apartment is conveniently located near great restaurants, grocery stores, and shopping, and just steps away from the subway and buses that will take you to anywhere in Stockholm.  Gabriella thoughtfully filled her fridge with breakfast essentials knowing that my jetlagged children would likely wake up hungry in the middle of the night.  She also left toys for my children to play with.  We could not be more pleased with the entire experience."
700113,74549860,2016-05-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Wonderful visit.  The host Ilona is helpful and very nice.  She made us feel welcome.  The apartment is in a great location with many nearby transportation options, supermarkets, restaurants, and a park right in front which the balcony overlooks.  Comfortable, clean, quiet, and well-equipped kitchen.  Highly recommend!"

795354,64527524,2016-03-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Gustav a great host. The appartment, located on the 4rd floor without elevator, is very suitable for two/three people, and the decor is sublime. It is very well located in a very charming neighbourhood in the north of the city. You've got all that you need nearby (park, supermarket, systembolaget, subway, espesso house, bus station...) It was clean when we came. The nice kitchen has got everything you need to prepare meal. On our arrival, Gustav left us a list with some recommended places. I recommand Gustav and his appartment !"
954832,76604061,2016-05-28T00:00:00.000Z,Myself and my wife stayed in the apartment for five nights from 23rd to 28th June 2016. We had an amazing stay. As we alighted from our
608672,318985573,2018-09-05T00:00:00.000Z,Karl was so wonderful! Extremely communicative and helpful. He met us at the flat and gave us a recommendation to eat at a local steakhouse. He also let us borrow a travel card which saved us a bit of money. We had a wonderful stay! Would highly recommend!
581243,132694600,2017-02-19T00:00:00.000Z,"I can just totally agree with everyone else, Edwin's place is just perfect! Everything absolutely clean, the room was comfortable and totally quiet, even if it's located on top of a big shopping mall.

We reached everything without using public transport.

We will definitely come back! :)

PS: Thanks again Edwin for organizing sunshine the whole weekend ;)"
581243,23161399,2014-11-24T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment is very clean and nice. The room is like you can see it on the picture. We shared the kitchen and bathroom with Edwin and his wife, which was no problem. We used the kitchen every evening, it is a big kitchen and fully equipped. The bathroom is also very clean and nice. The apartment is located directly at Karlaplan metro station, which is two metro stops away from the central station. We enjoyed our stay a lot and recommend the apartment."
900043,154213430,2017-05-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Accurate description, the place was very cute and clean and the neighborhood was great. Christin was also lovely. Would recommend!"
242188,174267316,2017-07-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Li was a fantastic host. She gave me very useful tips on where to go upon arrival. We were having coffee and cale while explaining the map of Stockholm. If I ever go back to Stockholm, I will definitely stay at Li's place!"
1170766,38842645,2015-07-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Annika's flat was perfect and very well located... Our stay (arrival and departure) was perfectly organised by Annika.
Above all, Stockholm is a wonderful city !!"
1212891,357729509,2018-12-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Un grand merci à Maud pour son accueil chaleureux ! Elle est une hôte très disponible, donne toutes les informations nécessaires pour arriver facilement chez elle depuis l’aéroport. Son logement est bien desservi, deux lignes de bus passent au pied de son immeuble et une station de métro à 5mn à pied. On trouve aussi des restaurants et commodités tout autour. 
On rejoint le centre en 10-15mn en métro. 
La chambre est petite mais cosy, l’espace est largement suffisant si vous êtes de sortie toute la journée et revenez juste pour dormir. Si vous souhaitez passer plus de temps dans le logement, tout est prévu pour vous de la cuisine à la salle de bain. 
Personnellement j’ai trouvé la literie super confortable ! Des oreillers et couvertures supplémentaires sont à disposition en cas de besoin mais nous avions largement assez.
Nous avons adoré discuter avec Maud et jouer avec Sammy à notre retour chaque soir. Maud, merci de votre gentillesse !"
739726,5175095,2013-06-17T00:00:00.000Z,Great apartment in the best part of town. Highly recommended!
1304431,67233715,2016-03-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Madeleine's flat is in a great neighborhood -- a perfect location for a first timer in Stockholm (with two small kids in tow !) There was plenty of space for our family of 4, and she was also kind enough to accommodate with a crib for my youngest. The space was clean and modern and in a safe, old building. Easy to find and check-in/check-out was a breeze."
1228583,427806507,2019-03-24T00:00:00.000Z,Linda is a very good host who does the little extra. Nice and stylish apartment with a fantastic view.
757320,21718314,2014-10-22T00:00:00.000Z,"We kwamen midden in de nacht aan door vertraging. Barb had al liggen slapen maar was erg vriendelijk. De kamer was erg netjes. Handdoeken en een kan met water stond klaar voor ons. Ze boodt nog aan thee te maken maar dat hoefden we niet. Het bed was groot en sliep heerlijk. Barb had ook nog een stapel flyers van attracties in de stad voor ons klaar gelegd. Haar appartement ligt heel erg centraal in een super leuke wijk. Van daaruit kun je makkelijk overal heen lopen. Barb is erg vriendelijk en rustig. Af en toe maakten we een praatje. We mochten overal gebruik van maken en er werd zelfs ruimte gemaakt in de koelkast voor ons. De enige pech voor ons was dat de lift gemaakt werd gedurende ons verblijf en we iedere keer 6 verdiepingen met de trap moesten. 
We raden Barb zeker aan!"
819676,280987610,2018-06-24T00:00:00.000Z,Location was perfect and apartment and view were beautiful! Hosts were super nice and accommodating. Would love to come back!

220851,422896896,2019-03-12T00:00:00.000Z,"I had really good time at Frederic’s place! Frederic was friendly and funny so I had a good time chatting with him. And, the room was very spacious and clean. Also, his place was very well equipped so everything was convenient for long-term stay!"
302496,74483290,2016-05-15T00:00:00.000Z,"We spent two weeks in Stockholm in Setas Apartment, working for the Eurovision Song Contest. After a hard working day Setas Apartment is the best place to relax, a lot of space for everyones privacy. Ecspecially I liked that many little Buddhas everywhere. Everything was clean and the flowers in the living area made us feel good. The beds are comfortable, in the kitchen you can find everything you need. It was perfect for us, we will come back, maybe if Sweden wins Eurovision again."
819676,120049111,2016-12-07T00:00:00.000Z,"My stay with Andy and Vannie was absolutely wonderful. I was a bit under the weather my first day so I didn't spend much time socializing, but the room was exactly as listed, clean, and comfortable. Andy met me at their home right after I got into the city to explain the keys and give me a tour which was wonderful to set my backpack down after flying in. On my second day, after wandering all over town and being quite exhausted, I was ready to turn in for the evening, but Andy was so kind and offered to hang out for a while - we went to the bar on the ground floor and then spent a while discussing Swedish vs American tastes in music. All in all, I had an absolutely wonderful time staying with Andy and Vannie and would love to come back again!"
1251466,47406352,2015-09-18T00:00:00.000Z,It is a nice and comfortable room. Both Dean and his wife are friendly. They picked us up at the metro station and showed us the attractions of Stockholm.
819676,158776823,2017-06-08T00:00:00.000Z,"This was my first visit to Stockholm, and Andy & Vannie made me feel very welcome. Clean and cosy room with a lovely view of the Old Town and a fancy private bathroom. The location was a stones throw from just about all the hippest joints in town. Andy & Vannie were also generous with their time, and gave me great advice on what to do in town. Don't hesitate to stay here-it's perfect for those who want to stay a few nights and catch the highlights of Stockholm. Thank you, I'll be visiting again!"
608672,96887784,2016-08-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Karl été très accueillant. Nous avons communiqué facilement avant le séjour, il a été arrangeant pour accommoder nos horaires. Il répondait très vite aux emails et a facilité nos changements de programme. Le studio est propre et fonctionnel. La douche n'est pas très pratique, mais pour un court séjour ça va. Le quartier est formidable, l'emplacement du studio est idéal, à 15 minutes à pied de la gare et 20 minutes du centre ville en passant par des rues piétonnes et commerçantes."
274876,6936274,2013-08-31T00:00:00.000Z,"Emma's place was a perfect choice for our visit to Stockholm. The apartment is well located and easy to find, close to good bars and restaurants, shops and public transport - but with the Old Town and local attractions only a few minutes easy and safe walk away, you'll probably not need it. The home is well furnished, stylish and clean with a great feel to it. There is a lovely balcony to enjoy the sunshine and view - no need for a clock, you can read the time on the Church tower! We all enjoyed our stay and hope we can stay there again before too long. Thoroughly recommend!"
514210,4704390,2013-05-21T00:00:00.000Z,"We had very nice stay with Magareta's family. They were really nice, friendly, helpful. They even came to pick us up at the central station. The flat is really clean, spacious with a really nice view, close to the bus station and have all the required accommodations around. Great value! We recommend!"
242188,203407447,2017-10-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Li was an amazing host! She provided me with so much information on transportation, museums, sights to see and things to do in Stockholm. The bed was super comfy and clean. Staying at her was place was very pleasant. It is centrally located and easy to get around. Highly recommend for anyone looking to stay in Stockholm."

1170766,314714350,2018-08-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Amazing quite place and host super kind. The house is set in the center of the city and close to the most important things to see.
Highly recommended."
1182616,16757083,2014-08-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Our host reacted extremely fast on our request if we could use his AIRBNB overnight. We felt more than welcome.
The apartment is simple but the kitchen is well equipped. good beds! We had a nice balcony. 
situated very comfortable near the centre of Stockholm City. The tube is a 3 minute walk away and in 3/4 of an hour your on the city centre square.
Our host and his friends made us more than clear that we were welcome."
242188,141161725,2017-04-02T00:00:00.000Z,"I want to thank Lidia, nice woman always kind and ready to give you all suggestions and information you need.
lidia's place is connected to central station by train (only one stop) and by metro as well (by metro you can reach all Stockholm areas) The apartment is near the metro stations too. 
If you love to walk you can also reach by feet the old city center and from there you can walk towards other districts.
Lidia offers you a cup of coffe or a cup of tea in the morning and she always greets you with a smile!
Recommended.

608672,452850567,2019-05-14T00:00:00.000Z,The location was amazing. It was clean and warm. All that I needed.

Thanks Daniel"
795354,511358084,2019-08-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Gustav's place is a convenient location for exploring Stockholm! Definitely recommend as a spacious value pick.

Pros: Location (2 blocks from metro), clean, spacious, highly communicative host

Cons: Walk-up (5th floor), low on amenities (e.g., no A/C, dryer, older linens, etc.), can be a noisy street at night (if windows are open)"
900043,111388884,2016-10-31T00:00:00.000Z,"The room was in a nice neighbourhood. We walked a couple of times to the centre of Stockholm, but if you don't want to, you could easily take the subway that was just 1 minute away. The room is okay if you don't want to spend too much time in the room. It had a little kitchen, a nice bathroom with shower, but unfortunately no bed (only a mattress on the floor) or wifi. But we especially liked the location. Quiet, but within a small distance of for example SoFo or the centre."
283446,2114703,2012-08-27T00:00:00.000Z,She was very helpful and provided all the information that was needed and was friendly at all times. The stay was perfectly comfortable.
299154,43367280,2015-08-19T00:00:00.000Z,Daniel's apartment was perfect for our stay in Stockholm! It was a 5-10 minute walk to Gamla Stan and in a great place in Södermalm. Daniel was helpful before and throughout our stay and I would highly recommend his apartment!
608672,219012401,2017-12-16T00:00:00.000Z,Karl was a fantastic host and was very welcoming. The apartment was in a fantastic location and perfect for our short stay. Thanks!
647314,14947147,2014-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Meine Mutter und ich haben drei Nächte bei Mallika verbracht. Es war unsere erste Reise nach Stockholm und wir haben uns gleich sehr wohl gefühlt. Die Wohnung von Mallika ist sehr gemütlich und wunderschön eingerichtet. Sie liegt im Viertel Södermalm. Von dort kann man sehr gut zu Fuß in die Altstadt laufen. Es gibt jede Menge kleiner Cafés in der Nähe. Wir haben unseren Aufenthalt bei Mallika sehr genossen. Sie hat uns viele nützliche Insider-Tipps gegeben. Ein Highlight war auf alle Fälle Ihre Geburtstagsfeier, zu der Sie uns freundlicherweise eingeladen hat. Für uns war es sehr schön neue Bekanntschaften zu machen. Wir würden auf jeden Fall wieder bei Mallika übernachten!"
916806,76433517,2016-05-27T00:00:00.000Z,"It was an unforgettable 7 days in Stockholm. The apartment is more than excellent. Mansour and Julia took care to make you feel home and that anything that you need, you can turn on them. The apartment has everything, everything is very clean and the location is wonderful. Every morning I drank coffee on the terrace with a view of the lake and this beautiful landscape. I recommend this apartment to all. Even the subway is a 10 minute walk and then by metro, 20 minutes to the central station. I will certainly come back! :) Tack, tack so mycket :)"

Everywhere is accessible by foot. Lidia was really lovely, she accommodated an early check in, made us coffee and circled many interesting things we should see on our short trip to Sweden. She is precise with her directions and made everything very easy for us. Thanks a lot Lidia, will definitely stay here again!"
954832,346922487,2018-11-10T00:00:00.000Z,Mikael's place was clean and comfortable. It was like he and his wife anticipated our every need even the things we didn't think of. Mikael's wife gave us a thorough run down of the apartment and there was lots of instructions that helped us with our stay. I would stay there again if I ever come back to Stockholm.
700113,69258592,2016-04-10T00:00:00.000Z,Ilona a été très sympa et accueillante. Le quartier est calme et la vue donne sur un parc très calme. Il faut un peu marcher pour rejoindre le centre mais cela se fait.
1212891,38092332,2015-07-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud made us feel extremely welcome from the moment she opened the door and gave us the tour. Her home is very close to the metro line and everything is described very well on the listing page. She is truly one of the most welcoming airbnb hosts. I really did feel at home during our 4 night stay, and had full access to her kitchen which I used extensively. The shared spaces are organized perfectly and labeled for guest use (there are 2 guest rooms available). Everything was very clean on arrival and stayed that way throughout our stay despite both of the guest rooms being occupied. Maud does a wonderful job! 

The area/neighborhood is very nice and cozy, and close to the waterfront and walking paths, as well as the huge grocery (and other item) store. We saw bunnies/hares all the time right outside the window, and had fun with Maud's cats as well. I saw very very minimal cat hair in the home (2 long haired cats), and did not have any allergy flare-ups. This is a great place and comfortable homely stay for a very reasonable price in Stockholm."
164448,89807876,2016-07-30T00:00:00.000Z,Stockholm is beautiful! Lidia is a great host ! She welcomed us at 7 am so she was really kind and the room was clean :)

L’appartement est très propre et très bien situé dans un quartier qui bouge beaucoup, à seulement 4 min du métro. 
Nous avons eu la chance de pouvoir admirer le soleil de
Minuit depuis la chambre de l’appartement... ça vaut le coup !
Je recommande a 100%"

Mallika was very helpful and made us feel at home right away. Ramses is lovely big cat that enjoys the foreign company. The apartment is very well located in a lively but still quiet neighbourhood. We used the citybikes stationed at Mariatorget to  go around town. Stockholm is simply wonderful!
Very much recommended. Thank you Mallika!"
299154,109715093,2016-10-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Daniel was really nice to us. He arranged the check-in according to our needs, gave really good advice and had clean linen and towels for us. The apartment was nice and cozy and the location was great. :) The kitchen might be a bit small for four people, but if you coordinate your meal preparations and everything, that works well too. The guest book and the guide book were good additions.

Overall, we were very happy with our stay and will probably visit again if the need arises."

Idéal pour un week-end, mais on y aurait bien passé une semaine !

D'autant qu'on a été particulièrement bien accueillis par Sanna, qui a un très joli studio en plein cœur de Sofo. Zen, très propre, chaleureux et romantique, idéal pour une personne seule ou un couple, avec toutes ces petites lumières qui font le charme des intérieurs de Suède. Nous recommandons chaleureusement !"

Most of the time, André was not at home, so we had the apartment all for ourselves. We've appreciated the privacy, his warm welcome, his clear communication and good upfront advice! The king-size bed was very soft and comfy. André knows the best places in town. Highly recommended."

In addition, this plat is totally private becuase it has seperated enterance and shower room.

Karl was so kind person, he was waiting for me until late night even though my flight was arrived at 23:20. In addition, he prepared apples that they harvest at his garden for me!"

The flat was very clean, warm and welcoming, and I had all the comforts and amenities I could ask for.

It was a little noisy due to the play ground, but it was a minor inconvenience. Li made sure to give tips about local sightseeing and transit systems. We also had some interesting conversations. Overall it was a very pleasant experience!"

A lot of experience has been put into assuring there are separate amenities and storage areas. Maud is renting two rooms, 'green & purple', each with its own space in the shower, kitchen, fridge etc. The place has notes with instructions on what and how to use and all the essentials (and not only) are present. The location mentioned is accurate and reachable by bus (to city centre / town hall) and metro (two stations nearby). There's also a very big supermarket nearby. Maud is a nice host and the property is great as long as you're not allergic to cats."

Il quartiere è molto carino, vicino al centro, vivace ma fuori dalle orde di turisti. sembra una zona davvero \"verace\".
Sanna è stata gentilissima e disponibile. Ci ha dato un sacco di informazioni utili ed abbiamo fatto con lei una chiacchierata davvero divertente.
Se torneremo a Stoccolma (e vogliamo davvero tornare presto) saremo felici di tornare ad alloggiare nel suo appartamento."

Great experience, tack Jarl!"
1124388,7918544,2013-10-08T00:00:00.000Z,Carl has a nice appartment close to the main bus lines. It's small but it can fit three people (1 couple in the bed + 1 guest on a foldout in the kitchen). We had a great time in Stockholm and Carl's place was a good (and cheap) alternative for a hotel.

The kitchen is well-equipped and (as others previously stated) the bed is very comfortable. The apartment has a perfect location - the metro station is right across the street, there are many bus stops in the area, the same for big supermarkets (Hemköp, Ica, Coop). There's also a wonderful bakery and a systembolaget really close. I highly recommend walking up the street to go to Monteliusvägen - a wonderful path which gives you an amazing view of the city. The Old Town can be reached in 15 minutes walking or 5 minutes by metro. If you're into vintage and retro, the SoFo district is really close and a few vintage shops are actually really close to Cecliia's place.
The contact with the host was really great - Cecilia helped me a lot and was really quick at responding. Everything went really smooth and I really recommend staying there!"

It’s stylish, it’s clean and it has everything you could possibly need, including plenty of food choices Paolo is sharing with his guests. It was easy to access this place and the communication with the host worked really well and quick. It’s the perfect place to explore Stockhom from, although with all the charming places around there is a risk you’ll never leave Södermalm."
1182616,16191271,2014-07-22T00:00:00.000Z,Had a great time at Peter's place. I didn't get the chance to meet Peter but the apartment is very close to the metro station and is very easy to get around the city.

274876,5961766,2013-07-24T00:00:00.000Z,We (=four adults and two small children) spent a week at Emma's place in July 2013 and enjoyed very much our stay in this nicely decorated flat. It is situated in a calm area close to bus stops and within a short walking distance from the old town. As a Mom of a three-year-old I also appreciated a great deal the many toys that we could borrow in the lovely yard - this meant that we could also spend time in a warm weather outside in the inner yard while our son was playing...Plenty of restaurants nearby (you can even have some take out food from the Pizzeria just 100m away or Indian/Thai...). Emma as a host was very helpful and kind so we would highly recommend her flat to all those who wish to spend some time in Stockholm and discover this beautiful city from another perspective and another neighborhood than the ones where many of the hotels are located. Thanks Emma!
700113,315218245,2018-08-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Ilona place is great. Clean, spacious, nice energy and close to all the things you need (public transport, city center, markets, etc.). Highly recommended."
608672,99458358,2016-09-04T00:00:00.000Z,"After a 10min walk from the Arlanda Express train-station we received a warm welcome from Karl. He explained everything, handed us over a city map, provided us with water and was here for further questions. 
He lives next door and is available if you've got any inquiries. 
The flat is located in a very quiet area where you feel safe (as well during night times). 
There are several brekky places within 5min walking distance and the pedestrian street Trottninggatan is only a stone's throw away. You can reach Gamla Stan (the old town) by foot within approx. 30min. 

The flat is perfect for a longer weekend stay with your friend or partner. It's quite small but everything fits in and you feel very cozy and welcome. 
We would definitely recommend this place and would go there again!"

This room has a tv and a desk. We share a bathroom on the basement floor with around five people. Location is not far from the subway station, but during night time you may pay attention. You can wash your clothes once a week, and must clean your room precisely before check out. I enjoyed my stay, and like Ali's apples so much! Many thanks again!"
581243,73298556,2016-05-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin was an excellent host, and his place is incredibly nice and clean.  He was very understanding even though we showed up kind of late because of travel delays, and his place is in a great location.  There is a huge shopping mall on the ground floor, and there's a metro station right outside, although you can walk to most places.  I would definitely stay at Edwin's place again."
1124388,14754496,2014-06-25T00:00:00.000Z,"The room was not so large but enough for a couple. We really liked the DIY taste (in a good sense) of the room. We could see the owner's tidy character from all the details in the room. Books, music, small objects etc ... We could go and come easily by bus between the apartment and the city center. If the weather was nice, we could even walk, I guess. We asked for a few times the change of check-in time (sorry ...) but each time Carl accepted pleasantly. He was such a nice person. Thank you !"
302496,6639908,2013-08-19T00:00:00.000Z,"This is a great apartment - it's absolutely huge and it's very well appointed.  Seta is a very accommodating host who went out of her way to let us check in and check out at very convenient times for our group, and to fix any issues we had with the apartment very quickly.  The location is great and everything you could possibly need is within a few minutes' walk.  I will definitely stay here again next time I'm in Stockholm."

She also has an other room with a single bed so we also met other travellers. There is a fridge, microwave/oven, water kettle, utensils and plates that were very useful."

I would recommend it, Thanks Linnéa :)

PD: during summer there's a lot of hours of sun, be prepared with a mask for your eyes if you are not use to sleep with daylight..., in the north of Europe the people are use to sleep like that, but not in other countries ;)"

We talked a lot during our stay, enjoying a cup of coffee or tea together.

The apartment is cozy, clean, in a nice area near Sodra station (5 minutes walking).

The photographs do not do it justice - very spacious and bright, and the perfect base to explore the city.  The apartment has everything you need and more. Isabelle responded quickly to any requests  -we had to stay another night due to my boyfriends work and this was accommodated quickly and efficiently.  I fell in love with the place and did not want to leave!"

The location is great, in trendy sodermalm. Very close to small food shops and two supermarkets (ica and lidl) and the metro. The kitchen was very well equipped and Paolo told us to use the tea and coffee and essentials like salt and pepper. Clean towels were provided and a hair dryer which was handy! I would use this apartment again and recommend it."

Parfait pour deux personnes, il est très sympa et assez équipé (frigo, four, plaques, bouilloire, machine à café, bon équipement musique et radio). Cependant, un peu éloigné du centre si l'on veut tout faire à pieds: je dirais une quarantaine de minutes. Tout même très accessible en bus (ligne très régulière qui amène à l'hypercentre en moins de 15 minutes). La communication avec Carl était très fluide (anglais), il a été très réactif ! Bref, je recommande ce logement pour un séjour dans la belle ville de Stockholm !"

Supermarkets and restaurants right outside. 15-20 minutes to old town, very conveniently located. There are 3 rooms in the apartment and we had 1 room. Room was very spacious and well-heated.

We were 3 couples living there, so a bit of waiting for the bathroom in the mornings. But when you are on holiday that is a minor thing. Great place situated very near the central train station and beautiful surroundings."

1261445,127431666,2017-01-18T00:00:00.000Z,"This was our first experience with an AirBnB rental, and if our experiences with future places are half as good as Marie-Louise's, they would still be great! In other words, this place was fantastic!

Marie Louise's daughter, Bianca, met us at the apartment and explained everything. The place was beautifully decorated and we immediately felt at home. It was very cozy.

Also, Marie-Louise supplied basic foodstuffs, eggs, cheese, juice, bread, milk, fruit, and on one of the tables a bouquet of fresh cut roses.

Communication was excellent throughout the reservation process and upon our arrival.

It was our first trip to Europe, a surprise for my wife's birthday, and we couldn't have been more pleased.

The view from the large windows was of a church with two tall steeples, and it was gorgeous.

We highly recommend Marie-Louise's place. Many thanks for making this stay wonderful!"

The location is great - it is across the street  from a park and the iconic Hogalid church, and is close to public transportation including the fast bus from the airport.  

Marie-Louise questioned us when we inquired about the reservation  to make sure we were OK with a small bathroom, and indeed this apartment has a small bathroom. The bathroom was fine for our 2 day stay."

It is very well located, one of Stockholm's main shopping street is just around the corner. 
It is small and you cannot do a lot of cooking in the kitchen but for people staying over short term and willing to eat out it is perfect. 
It is just like a hotel room basically with a small kitchen added. 
Karl was very helpful in every way."

Sandra responded quickly when we had questions and check-in was seamless. The neighborhood is peaceful and attractive - very pleasant to return home to after day out in the city. For those using public transportation to get around - be aware that it takes a while to get to and from the city center. If this is not a concern, then I highly recommend Sandra's place!"

Room exactly as advertised (although pictures don't capture the best angles), everything needed was there and couldn't find any area which was particularly dirty.

She gave us all the privacy we needed, while at the same time being open and warm towards us. Barb even prepared a special breakfast for us to get to know the Swedish cuisine a little better. That was a very nice experience. It really felt as if we were visiting a distant aunt. All together a great stay."

1251466,42625739,2015-08-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Not the room you see on the pictures! Apartment was totaly different!
We would not recomend to stay there. Bathroom was not very clean and if we would have seen it before, we would probably book something different.
Address is not as written here in airbnb - the appartment is directly located at Akeshov Metro station. Also it seemed strange to us, that the host answered from a different phone number.
Most of the time the host were not in the appartment with us, so we had little interaction with him.
Kitchen is absolutly not well equiped and not than clean, that we would cook there.
I'm sorry, even if Dean (the host) was friendly and picked us from the Metro station, we would not recomend to stay there.
The central station is 22min by metro and more close to the old town takes even longer!"
620848,7236687,2013-09-13T00:00:00.000Z,"I have only praise for Hanna and K's place and the service they offer. Hanna was always available on email so making arrangements was easy and she provided lots of relevant information and will meet you wherever works best for you. 

The apartment is very convenient - very near to the station which has frequent trains - and also pleasant to be in - light and sunny.

Hanna generously has the fridge and cupboards stocked with basics so there is something to nibble and you don't immediately have to go to the shops (although they are so close that shopping for food is no problem).

Staying in their apartment made a weeklong Stockholm visit affordable and relaxing.  It was lovely after a day exploring to return to the tranquility of the apartment and trains came every 15 mins from Central Stockholm (and the train comes through
 Sodemalm too) .  And it is really easy to reach directly from the airport too. There is a huge forest park nearby if walking in nature is your thing.

Having a bed in the lounge means it is easy to share the apartment with friends and I was also there for 2 days alone and felt very safe.

For me it was the ideal place with the ideal hosts. Hanna was so concerned to make my stay  be as good as it could be e.g. checking whether I wanted yoghurt or bread and cheese (but in fact providing both options) and offering to come later on the day I was leaving, so she did not interrupt me.

It's located quite good (underground in 2 minutes, bikes can also be borrowed), so you can walk to most of the sightseeing highlights of Stockholm. The Vasa museum is only 15 minutes walk away and if you don't mind walking you can also reach any other things. Edwin is a very nice host, he had maps he gave us and explained everything very well. We could use everything in his apartment and he even had towls for us. The kitchen had everything you needed. The internet also worked very good as Edwin also uses it quite often ;)!
We can really recommand this apartment, it is perfect for tqo people wanting to do some sightseeing in Stockholm!
We'll probably come back next year! :)"

The rooms in the flat are at different ends of the corridor which ensures a great deal of privacy. I had a very pleasent stay at Jarl's flat! The only downside was the comparably slow internet connection.

It is the first time I left home for such a long time and I thought it will be really hard for me to be far from the ones I care for, but Vidhatri made it really easy for me. She is just the perfect host ever! At her place I felt like being at home. She is so kind and it's a pleasure to stay and have a nice conversation at dinner or during the day at a cup of coffee. I really don't have to say that she is a great cook, because you will discover if you will chose this apartment. ( which it's really clean, cosy and only one minute away from the subway station ). If you need a place to stay in Stockholm I highly recommend Vidhatri's place."

Beautifully clean, a big bathroom, small, railroad kitchen but I cooked with no problems. Plenty of closet space.The double bed is comfortable. Ilona is a perfect hostess, ready to help but discrete and non-intrusive. A guest only shares an ante-room which leads to Ilona's place and the Airbnb apartment she offers. When I return to Stockholm, I wouldn't consider going anywhere else. Ilona told me she has many repeat visitors, some who come to 
Stockholm for work, many times. Five stars out of five."

Lidia knows the city of Stockholm and was willing to share her knowledge of the city with us to give us the best ideas on what to see and when to see it so that we could fit everything in that we wanted to see before we were to leave Stockholm to continue our tour.  Thank you Lidia!

Located in the best part of hip Sodermalm, and a short walk to Gamla Stan (though we personally preferred the less touristy Sodermalm, in addition to day trips to Vaxholm in the archipelago, time spent at Centralbadet in Normalm, etc.) Lina met us to give us personalized suggestions when we arrived. There are 3 grocery stores a block away, many thrift shops on a nearby street, very convenient. Flexible self checkout on our last day. The apt is of course beautiful with the kitchen having a view of the street where you can see the sunset and the living room having a view to lovely courtyard. Lina's apt was even better in person and had everything we needed for a week-long stay."

I did not stay in the flat myself but visited them throughout the weekend. The flat is spacious enough to host three people easily, but could probably host up to five people without any problem.

And Edwin has prepared everything before I come. After I get the key from Edwin, I always not at that home. Therefore, I have few interactions with Edwin. Nevertheless, I added Edwin's (Hidden by Airbnb) . I preferred to text him as my English accent is quite different from Edwin. Edwin answered all my questions very soon. At last, the room is worth to rent, it is near the centre of Odd City Zone. Only 3 metro stations to there."

608672,19317244,2014-09-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Karl provided comprehensive pre-trip information, and a cheerful welcome when we arrived at the apartment. The apartment is ideal if you are looking for a characterful experience of staying in Stockholm for a few days. The shower layout is an interesting novelty, but Karl explained the reason and it just added to the character of staying in an older traditional Stockholm apartment. Location and access to must see attractions is excellent, and overall the accommodation, and amenities contributed towards the enjoyment of our stay. Don't miss out on seeing Stockholm's Town Hall. Very impressive!"

Ich wurde vom Bahnhof abgeholt und bei der Abreise bis zum Zug begleitet, habe Info-Materialien und tolle Tips für Stockholm bekommen, wurde einigen Freunden vorgestellt und zu Aktivitäten / Festivitäten mitgenommen - so konnte ich das alltägliche Stockholm erleben, was mir sehr gut gefallen hat. Das Zimmer ist schön groß, sauber und grenzt an den Wald, was eine schöne Abwechslung ist zur Stadt tagsüber. Auch war Isabelle sehr interessiert an meinen positiven Erfahrungen und Entdeckungen, um sie an zukünftige Gäste weitergeben zu können.

The location in Södermalm is great, offering many facilities nearby (shopping, public transport, city bikes, etc.). We also enjoyed the fast internet access. As the room is not darkened overnight, do not forget to bring along sleeping masks, especially during summertime. For the rest I recommend the location without hesitation."
1149820,32245286,2015-05-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Klaras apartment was fantastic and just as gorgeous as it looks on the pictures! It's in a perfect location with a short walk into Hornstull (and the tube station) as well as being, literally, across the road from the amazing island of Langholmen, which is perfect for a morning stroll.
Klara sent us really useful information about accessing the building and the amenities of the area before hand, which was extremely helpful as it was our first time in Stockholm.
Unfortunately we weren't able to meet Klara on our visit but she arranged to have her friend meet us when we arrived to drop off the keys. Very impressed overall!"

It was near the metro but we really didn't used even once because you could go walking almost everywhere (15min to the old town, Gamla Stan). The neighborhood was very nice also, with everything that we need very near (bar, restaurant, supermarket) and also it was kind of the old town architecture and very beautiful to walk (there was an amazing view point to Gamla Stan only 2min of the apartment)

They are very nice, very easy to contact and helpful with every needs that we had. They leave us an amazing map with recommendations like bars, shops and restaurants that was very helpful!

If we ever come back to Stockholm we would definitely stay in his apartment again! 

Totally recommended!"

Malgré leur absence, l'entrée dans les lieux a été très facile grâce à une porte à code très simple d'utilisation. Pas de souci de clé. Le quartier est très agréable, le petit lac et le parc avec café et pâtisseries juste à côté. C'était très agréable de rentré dans ce havre de paix après une journée de marche en ville. Notre hôte a été très accueillant et nous a même facilité notre départ en nous amenant à la gare avec tous nos bagages. Merci encore!"

Everything was like he says in the description of the room, so there where no bad surprises!

The neighborhood has supermarkets and anything you need. And you can also walk everywhere to the centre and so on easily in 10 min.

All in all a nice place to stay :)"
739726,6555775,2013-08-17T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a fantastic stay at Sanna's place. The place is just as welcoming and clean as the pictures show it to be. Sanna greeted us at her place and we were able to chat for a bit. She is a great host and gave us some tips on dining places around her neighborhood. We really liked the area, lots of cafes and bars, and grocery stores. While she does not offer WiFi in her apartment, this was not a big deal, as there are 2 cafes, one right around the corner and also Il Caffe, both of which were ideal. Great breakfast and good coffee. The apartment is larger than we thought and very comfortable. More room than we even needed. We had no problems catching the bus to town (#76 I believe?). We also walked to the water, which is close to her place and took a boat into town. After touring several areas of Stockholm, we were very glad we stay in this neighborhood. Very artsy, with young families everywhere, very few tourists. We loved Stockholm and we would definitely stay here again. Thank you!"

I decided to try because of the excellent reviews of Andy's and Vannie's place. It did not disappoint. The room was all I needed and the private bathroom was spotless and very spacious. I loved the little fridge in the room! The location is brilliant, very short walk into Gamla Stan and it's easy to get around from the flat. And finally, Andy and Vannie were very friendly and helpful. Thank you!"

It would have been difficult to find but his instructions were clear so there was no problem. He's very kind, friendly and respectful of privacy. It is close enough to walk to the centre but also easy to get the underground. 

I will definitely try to use the room again if I go back to Stockholm, which I hope to!"

He was great host, really caring. He helped me with directions from the airport to the apartment as well with tips like where to find the best bread.
For a few days of my stay he wasn't there but he always kept contact over phone and email, so I never felt alone at all. Plus, I really had my privacy!
The apartment is in a nice neighbourhood, all the public transport is very near and you\"ll be in the old town in 10 minutes.

House is amazing, with an even more impressive garden with BBQ (which we could use and Dany even left charcoal for us!) and lots of fun for kids (trampoline and swings). Dany was so helpful and really did everything to make us feel welcome, we got to borrow high chair and crib for our 18months old, and he even prepared breakfast and treats for us. House is in a one way street so super quiet and with soo comfortable beds we all slept like babies (including the baby :)

We hardly ever used train or bus, everything is in walking distance. Henriks brother, who gave the keys to us, helped us out with some very helpful information. We even found a map and further information about wireless internet in the kitchen and fresh towels in the bedroom. Henrik really cares for his guests.There's no better choice for Stockholm, I think! We had a great time! Thanks for everything!"

Only 20 minutes on the metro out of Stockholm, it gives you the opportunity to be out in the country but close enough to the city. The neighbourhood is very quiet but has all the shops you need just down the road! If you had any problems Mansour or Julia would reply very efficiently to make sure you are happy! They also provided a very useful booklet full of local information. I would definitely recommend this place to stay as it is in a lovely location and it is warm and very comfortable. The only negative is that it was slightly unclear where the best place for parking was as we had a hire car."

The area around of the apartment was very pleasantly, green and quiet. Viveka has did our journey unforgettable. Stockholm is great!
We can just recommand, to spend holidays on Vivekas nice place!!!

Definitely enjoyed our stay in Stockholm!"
1212891,137249508,2017-03-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud is basically the most perfect host you can ever have. She's nice, helpful, polite and funny. Whenever she can she will help you with everything. 
When I was planning my trip to Stockholm, I searched for a host that had nice ratings and some experience on this site because it was my first time traveling with AirBnb. As a host Maud has raised the standards and I'm definitely traveling again through this site thanks to her (and also if I come back to Stockholm I will stay with her again for sure!!).

Sammy, her cat, is really quiet and easy to get along with, he is such a nice and funny cat!

The house location was perfect in my opinion. It is located on a residential area so everything is quiet and relaxing, you can also see how Swedes live. There's a big supermarket REALLY close from Maud's home and there you can find anything you need. Also, it was really easy to go to the main attractions and the most famous parts of the city through the metro/subway (which is 4min by walking from Maud's home). I visited almost every single part of Stockholm in a matter of 3 days!

I have really enjoyed my trip in Stockholm and I would like to thank Maud because without her and her beautiful home it would not have been the same!!"
954832,434589650,2019-04-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Perfect pad for a short stay in Stockholm. Couldn't ask for a friendlier host. No fuss, easy check in and out. Fast communication, spotless and great value for money."
442837,3656479,2013-02-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Jo's place was clean and well located.  Her place is only a few stops from Slussen and Gamla Stan, both of which are very close to many sight-seeing opportunities.  It's only a 5 minute walk to the nearest metro station and there's a large shopping center surrounding the stop.  There is a grocery store that is very close which is open until 10PM each night; this is very convenient for times when you need a quick snack or something for dinner late at night.  For the first few days of my stay I didn't see Jo very much since we were both busy.  The last night of my stay though we were able to chat about life in the US and Sweden, some of the things I did while I was there, etc.  She was easy to talk to and was very knowledgable about the area.  I would recommend her place to anyone looking for a place to stay while visiting Stockholm."
624886,12064591,2014-04-22T00:00:00.000Z,"As a family of four (2 kids aged 7 and 4) we had the best week in Stockholm mostly because Lisa and Oskar apartment was the perfect home away from home. The area is just perfect, quiet with a great playground and a small island to wonder around nearby, the best bakery next to the subway (you reach any part of Stockholm very quickly) and the supermarket. The apartment itself is just perfect, beautifully decorated, bright, confortable, spotless and with everything you would need. Our kids loved the boys room with the toys and we had the best of time relaxing after wandering all day. Oskar was the perfect host and everything was easy to deal with. All our friends want to go to Stockholm and to Oskar's now! Thank you again we will come back."
164448,282878669,2018-06-28T00:00:00.000Z,"It is really a great experience to practice Yoga with Solveig’s perfect instructions. There are a few things that I am really impressed on: 1)
She chooses a perfect location which is outdoor while can enjoy the sun, the wind and the Frankfurt City sky view at the same time; 2) Solveig’s coaching is with her own peace and enjoyment that I can feel the calmness and I believe she enjoys the process for each coaching; 3) There are some certain Yoga post that I am always struggle on for years but Solveig gave me excellent tips that how to correct my movement; 4) It was also a surprise that her Airbnb booking includes an detail Frankfurt guide with a decent presentation, moreover she arranged a coffee time in the Cafe that we both can relax and talk for our life and lifestyle right after the Yoga Practice. It is a very good experience, worth recommending!"

688947,72626936,2016-05-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Alexandre is a very helpful and outgoing host. We couldn't choose a better place to stay in Stockholm. We lived in a very peaceful, green district, 17 min. from the old town (subway, no. 17). Thera are some shops, park and sport grounds in the neighbourhood. We had our own room and a full access to kitchen and bathroom. Alex gave us keys to his apartment and for our convenience he even spent the nights by his friend. We strongly recommend this host to all travellers! Thank you Alexandre! Best regards!"
1212891,100358532,2016-09-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud' place was perfect for us. It was only a short metro ride from Stockholm and the room was very comfortable. Her cat, Sammy, is one of the sweetest cats I have ever met! She doesn't let Sammy in the rooms so they stay very clean (no cat hair). Overall it is a great place to stay when you're visiting Stockholm!"
1250227,6597980,2013-08-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Per has a small but very pleasant apartment with a lot of character. We've stayed there with our family, two kids. The quiet street is conveniently located near a tube station. Östermalm is not as hip and happening as Södermalm, but a good base for exploring every corner of the city. We haven't met Per personally and his communication was brief but sufficient.
If you look for a fancy, super clean place on a lively and hip location, this isn't yours. If you want a cosy, quite place in a more traditional part of town without spending too much, this might be perfect for you."

164448,104832477,2016-09-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Everything as described,  Lidia buzzed us into the building and after showing us to our room kindly sat us down with a cup of tea and showed us on a map some of the highlights of Stockholm. We slept well and enjoyed our stay. The underground system was less than 10 mins walk away."
608672,357403836,2018-12-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Stayed in Karl's apartment for 2 nights in December and it was lovely. Well furnished, clean and just enough for 1-2 people. The location could not be better, very close to downtown Stockholm but you don't hear any noise from the downtown area which is a huge plus. Me and my friend liked the stay here and would book it again :) Karl and Karin were extremely nice! and good to have them just next door if there's anything."

The neighborhood was quiet and easy to get around. Mikeal was very helpful and kind with a lot of advices to visit Stockholm. 
Thank to our great hosts Anna-Karine and Mikeal, we really appreciated these two months in your flat. 
We will recommend this flat to our friends."
916806,18261540,2014-08-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Overall mitigated experience, maybe by comparison with the previous places we stayed at. The studio is clean and well equipped but is not very soundproof (there was a party upstairs one of the evenings). The location in itslef is also nice, with a great view and nice private terrace, but the neighborhood does not particularly invite to walks outside. Finally, our host answered all of our questions, but sometimes at the last moment (details for our arrival)."

The flat was comfortable and homely, with plenty of bits and pieces to accomodate cooking/eating when there. Good shower, nice and warm (given it being -4 outside) and quiet/safe block of flats and area. 
Transport links to city centre were fantastic and regular, running late at night when needed. Local store was just across the road had everything you needed grocery wise. Not many local bars/restaurants, however central area only 10 min by bus, so no problems to get out in the evening. 
Would strongly recommend for a break in Stockholm, easy to get around to main attractions, and to/from Central Station/Arlanda Airport. Thank you!"

The room in her house actually is even nicer than the photo! Everything is clean, tidy, lovely, comfortable  and make me have a very good memory in Maud's house!

It's very easy to get to the city and takes about 20 min by bus and underground.

We did not any particular area of Stockholm in mind when looking for a place to stay, so we sort of stumbled into SoFo.  What a great place to stay.  A lot of restaurants, galleries and interesting mix of people.  Victor's place is clean, comfortable with quality bed and well equipped kitchen.  

Victor was very responsive and easy to communicate.  He was able to accommodate our travel requirements.  The restaurants the he suggested were amazing.

House is very upscale and clean and smells very nice! :-)
Room is good for a solo traveler. I got my own toilet/shower although not inside the room but that is ok.
Location - very very good - 10min walk to Gamla Stan; and just around the corner is Slussen station. This Metro line is very good because there are lot of different trains that stops here.
On this same street, Gotgatan and parallel to where Andy & Vannie leaves, there is a lot of boutiques and cafe/bars. Also there is a House of Candy near the station! :-)
Walk further down Gotgatan (away from Gamla), you'll find a street perpendicular to it which also has some restaurants/bars and some supermarkets.
Very hip neighborhood, residential but has a few restaurants and shops too. 
I highly recommend Il Tempo if you are into Italian. This is on the same street as their place. Great pasta!!
At the end of their street, across from the square is a Coop supermarket, which is open until 11pm.
I will definitely stay here again. I like the ambience of this place but most importantly too is I like the hosts! I travelled alone so having friendly hosts made my experience much more wonderful.
Make sure to go to House of Candy -- for chocolates!"

The supermarket around the corner is supergood and there's a park nearby. Nathalie gave us some maps and suggestions to do in Stockholm. 

The apartment is very nice, it matches the pictures perfectly. My boyfriend and I slept in the bedroom and my boyfriends brother on the comfortable couch. There were no curtains in the livingroom but he was OK with that.

We contacted Dany several times with questions and he always answered immediately with helpful hints and suggestions. We loved sitting outside on their porch, enjoying the garden and birds and enjoyed cooking in their fully equipped kitchen.
Dany, his wife and kids are superb hosts and we appreciated very much being able to stay at their perfect house. Thank you again to the whole family for this very pleasant Swedish experience!!!!"

Li is a sweet lady and when you arrive she has a city map ready for you and will go over where to find things in the city. WiFi is strong and works well.

The following reasons are why I did not give Li's place a 5.
The address is to the apartment complex not her apartment so you need to has access to a phone to call her to let you in.

She uses her upstairs for Airbnb. There are three bedrooms and one bath. At times the bathroom is in use so you need to plan your day accordingly to maybe having to wait to get into the bathroom.

She does not give kitchen privileges though she has a small microwave and refrigerator is the small sitting room upstairs. So if you plan on eating a lot of your meals there they will all have to be microwaveable. She has no coffee pot, just instant coffee. To get water and wash dishes you need to use the bathroom sink.

Her TV's are the old tube type before remote controls. The picture is very fuzzy. If relaxing with TV after a long day is something you do, you won't be able to do that here.

She has no black out curtains on the windows. We were there in July and the sun hits you in the face at 3:30 am. I was lucky enough to have an eye mask that I got on the plane or there would have been no way I could have slept in that room

There is no visible electric outlet in the bathroom so hair drying etc has to be done in your room.

Li will come into your room during the day and make your bed and straighten your things, even if the door is locked. If you do not want her to come into your room you will need to let her know that when you check in."
164448,269464566,2018-05-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Li is a nice host - she was informative of the area and things to do. The common area upstairs is shared among three rooms and that area is nice place to have conversations. The location of this place is close by to the T, so getting around everywhere is fast and easy."

Il nous a donné tous les renseignements dont nous aurions besoin pour le logement, les visites et les déplacements.
L'appartement est confortable, chaleureux nous avons vraiment eu l'impression de \"vivre à la suédoise\"

Séjour très agréable
Merci Pär!"

556363,51738802,2015-10-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Appartement très agréable, lumineux et avec de beaux volumes. Bien équipé (cuisine, TV, salle de bains), il est tout à fait adapté pour une famille. Lennard est passé nous voir et il est très amical. Le quartier est très bien desservi (métro, bus, vélo) et on y trouve tout le nécessaire (restaurants, supérette, take away...)
Notre séjour dans cette belle ville a été un réel plaisir (musées, ballades, shopping)."
514210,32160277,2015-05-15T00:00:00.000Z,"My stay in Stockholm was fantastic. Margareta made me feel most welcome in her home and was extremely helpful with everything. The room was lovely and spacious with en-suite bathroom and balcony. As the description says, there is a beautiful view out to the forest. Sköndal is a suburb of Stockholm with a shopping centre two minutes walk from the apartment that has a supermarket, bank, chemist, newsagent and restaurant. The bus stop is about 7 minutes walk and buses run into Stockholm every two or three minutes. It takes ten minutes bus ride to get to Gullmarsplan metro station and then from there the metro goes all over Stockholm. From the flat to the very centre of Gamla Stan takes half an hour at the most. The apartment is in a very quiet area of Stockholm and it was nice to return to a peaceful area after a busy day in the city. A twenty minute bus ride to the south brings you to Tyresta National Park, where it is possible to go for long hikes amongst the ancient forest and lakes."

1271843,509328537,2019-08-14T00:00:00.000Z,"I had a quiet room, pleasantly decorated, away from the street.  The kitchen and bathroom are well set up. The apartment is located in a trendy neighborhood with a Tunnelbana (subway) station close by. Only 3 stations from the centre of Stockholm,  very convenient.  There are many choices for dining, drinking and shopping in this neighborhood of Sodermalm, in a quiet street parallel to Hortsgatan. Andre has a warm, friendly personality and he was very helpful with advice."

1182616,13071294,2014-05-19T00:00:00.000Z,Vistelsen har fungerat klanderfritt. Allt som vi behövt har funnits tillgängligt. Balkongen var ett gott val då vädret bjöd på solsken en av de två dagarna vi hyrde. Nära till fina mysiga matställen och tunnelbana för vidare transport. Ett rätt enkelt men bra boende. Peter är en uppmärksam och pålitlig värd enligt vår uppfattning.
1212891,79853390,2016-06-14T00:00:00.000Z,"I booked Maud's place due to the Swedish pilot strike. The house locate in a very quiet and safe area. Also it near the metro station, which only takes 10 minutes to get to the center of Stockholm. The room is lovely and even more nice than what photo shows. If you love pat. Maud has two cats, they are very beautiful, and quiet. Above all, everything is fantastic. Hope I will come back soon!"
259722,961982,2012-03-01T00:00:00.000Z,"I highly recommend Marcello. he is an excellent host, since  I arrived until the minute I left, he was very helpful and always trying to make a  memorable time in Stockholm. He pretty much provided with everything I needed; tips where to go in the city, computer, even a cell phone. Definitively it went beyond my expectations. Last day he made a great farewell lunch. No better place to stay while in Stockholm. He will make you feel
like at home away from home.

Thanks Marcello"

1054406,174519302,2017-07-26T00:00:00.000Z,Vi er en familie på to voksne og tre barn som ville tilbringe noen dager i Stockholm. Leiligheten ligger i et rolig og barnevennlig nabolag og det var enkelt å komme seg til å fra sentrum av Stockholm med offentlig transport . Vi følte oss veldig velkommen når Thomas hadde kjøpt inn litt mat og brukte tid til å vise oss rundt i nabolaget når vi kom.

Lidia also explained the train system, places to see and all, very comprehensively. The room was cozy and tidy, and the common room had lots of couches etc, for relaxing. Definitely recommended"
875505,77268856,2016-05-31T00:00:00.000Z,Electra was very accommodating regarding our arrival time and gave us some useful information about where to go for groceries etc. The apartment itself was clean and tidy and had everything we needed for a weekend stay. It's also very well located in the heart of Stockholm. The one negative is that the duvet provided for the sofa bed is quite small for two people who are sharing but this could be easily fixed and overall it was a great stay.
1124388,22679715,2014-11-11T00:00:00.000Z,"It was a cozy apartment, and Carl tried to make it as friendly as possible for us. The location is decent, with bus 1 within 3 minutes walking that goes pretty much everywhere. I enjoyed the stay and would recommend it to anyone staying in Stockholm for a couple days!"
1041103,5910407,2013-07-22T00:00:00.000Z,"We had an excellent stay at Karoline's place. We did not have the chance to meet in person but she arranged someone to hand us the keys, despite our very late arrival. The fridge was stocked amply with breakfast goods and the location was very convenient for exploring the city."
1184553,470627163,2019-06-16T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a lovely stay in Stockholm and Annbritt's place was in a perfect location - right in the centre of Södermalm and really good transport links (the closest metro stop was Medborgarplatsen and we could get everywhere we wanted from here). The room was tidy and spacious with nice homely touches, it was sunny and hot when we visited so the fan was very welcome. Check-in and out was easy, Annbritt wasn't around for most of our stay but kept in touch and was very friendly; she was welcoming but also left us to get on with our trip which was a good balance."
536283,5089058,2013-06-11T00:00:00.000Z,Paolo was an excellent host and his apartment was wonderful. Communication with Paolo was flawless before and during my stay. The apartment was clean and tidy when I arrived and everything worked as expected.

Anton var enormt sød til at tage imod os og super tjekket. Der var så rent og blomster overalt da vi kom samt en flaske champagne - ren luksus. Nabolaget var virkelig fedt og meget tæt på metroen samt indkøbsmuligheder og masser gode restauranter og butikker!!
Sindssygt dejlig og hyggelig lejlighed og KLART anbefalelsesværdigt.."
1243144,8859438,2013-11-22T00:00:00.000Z,"An was the perfect host, met me on arival and showed me around the apartment.  She couldn't have been more helpful during my stay, answering any questions I had.
The apartment is so nice, big rooms, quiet, comfortable and in a great location.
I couldn't have wished for a better place to spend two weeks in Stockholm."
1124388,13076925,2014-05-19T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a very nice stay in Carl´s appartment. It´s easy to get into the city center, Carl´s sightseeing tips have been very helpful and the rooms are comfortable and pleasant to stay in. I can only recommend staying there!"
1205051,37862881,2015-07-11T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment was great, very nice size for two people, and had everything we needed for an 8 night stay. Furniture and bed were very comfortable too. Viktor was a kind and considerate host. When coffee cartridges ran out for the Nespresso machine, he sent some around. And when they needed to drop off a piece of furniture during our stay, he sent a bottle of champagne for our troubles (though it was no trouble at all).

The neighbourhood is also outstanding. Lots of shops and bars and cafes, and it's a world away from the touristy areas of the city. If you prefer to get a sense of what it's like to live in a place, this is the apartment for you. Be sure to check out Pet Sounds too, the coolest record shop in Stockholm.

We were sad to leave."
628555,126754970,2017-01-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Our stay at Anna's can be described in one word: perfect!
Anna met with us really late due to our flights and organized a cab for us. During our whole stay, we had her apartment for ourselves. Everything was remarkably clean and the apartment itself is really stylish. 
The location is also really good, since it's really quiet and you can reach a big supermarket (coop) and the train station, from where it takes 12 minutes to town within 10 minutes of walking. 
We would totally recommend Anna's apartment to you, thanks for everything!"
757320,114029424,2016-11-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Cosy and clean room with all the facilities you need, the best location you can get, quiet but right in the middle of plenty good restaurants and shops.

608672,80279966,2016-06-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Karl greeted me as soon as the lift arrived at his floor (even though I was somewhat early). He is very nice and helpful. The listing is accurate, but perhaps doesn't capture the charm of this small flat with its high ceilings and plaster moldings. The shower is slightly awkward to operate, especially for Americans who are accustomed to a distinct shower stall, but this is a minor issue. The neighborhood, despite being \"in\" central Stockholm, is quiet and in every sense perfect, which makes walking in any direction incredibly convenient."

Everything you need is within walking distance (cafés, restaurants, supermarkets, etc.). Maria is a wonderful host. Communication was easy. She answered all our questions, provided helpful tips and was very welcoming and friendly. The apartment and Maria as a host are both highly recommended."

The new, sunny and clean apartment is well located and very well deserved by public transport; metro, bus and tram are all indeed within 1 mn reach from  the house and one can even walk to Gamla Stan (about 45 mn). Lilhjiholmen is a safe neighborhood and one could enjoy the lake/park/river behind the metro station (nice area deserving a tour). As if it was not already good enough, Jo is a very nice, warmhearted and friendly host. Should I go back to Stockholm one day, it will be at Jo's place without hesitation."

We walked together to her apt and by the time we arrived (5 minutes later) I knew we were in the right place. Maud is warm and welcoming and has a lovely apt set up for guests. Everything is labeled, available and helpful. We had tour info, tea and coffee and even some pain medicine for my sore foot. When we return to Stockholm we will certainly stay with Maud. Her place is convenient to train but quiet and clean and her kitties are adorable."
581243,103408068,2016-09-22T00:00:00.000Z,Awesome stay! Very modern and clean. The apartment is right opposite the subway and close walk to a lot of museums and a huge park.

The apartment is in a very nice neighborhood with looks of parks around. It only takes 10 mins to get to Stockholm central, so the location of her apartment is really great! You can use the kitchen to cook and the room you stay in is very cozy. As a bonus, you will get to meet the fluffiest cat in the world! Would definitely recommend staying there."

1261445,318000803,2018-09-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice quiet part of town, across from a park and church on a quiet street. The kids upstairs were a bit raucous, but they went to bed early so were not a problem. Marie-Louis' daughter Bianca welcomed us and gave us many helpful tips and suggestions, as well as instructions on how to use everything. The bed was sooo comfortable, and the quiet lived-in feel of the apartment made us feel quite at home. We enjoyed all the little goodies Bianca was so kind as to have shopped for us, and we even got quite used to the \"Stockholm\" shower, which worked much better than we had expected. The Tapas restaurant down on the corner was excellent (make reservations or go early!), but the African place in the next black was totally forgettable. Only a block from the subway, buy a pass and get anywhere in town in just minutes."

904739,40507367,2015-07-31T00:00:00.000Z,My stay at Menaf's place was very enjoyable. The studio was clean and the location was perfect. Menaf was very helpful and responsive during my stay. His directions from the airport where very detailed which made finding the unit without gps possible and easy for me. I landed in Stockholm early Monday morning and he was kind enough to let me check in early at no cost.  I would highly recommend his place to anyone visiting Stockholm.

La zona es muy bonita y se llega rápidamente al centro de Estocolmo con el bus 144, y luego en metro o en tren.  Merece la pena hacer este trayecto para descansar, después de recorrer Estocolmo,  en esta zona rodeada de naturaleza,  muy tranquila y con un lago cercano. 
Thomas responde rápidamente a todas las dudas y preguntas.
La casa está limpia,  es muy agradable y no falta de nada. 
Incluso te deja el frigorífico y la despensa con comida y bebida; lo cual nos ayudó mucho en la primera noche. 
Nos hubiera encantado conocer a Thomas para darle las gracias personalmente. 
Lo recomendamos 100 por 100."

For the few spare hours I had, Lotta was very helpful in pointing out numbers of cafes, restaurants and parks, places to see, and also to avoid (better to steer away from touristy locations to discover the real city!). Would definitely come back :)"

Her place is very spacious and covers all your travelling necessities without feeling too convoluted or overly furnished which helps a great deal in making the flat feel like your home in a very short time. It was super clean and has a very spacious bathroom too. Electra herself was very accommodating and carefully explained everything which I really appreciated. Last but not least, the flat is conveniently situated literally in the heart of the city. It truly doesn't get any better than that. Irrespective of if you want to do some shopping, discover good restaurants and cafés, go for a walk at Djurgården, visit the museeums or make a boat trip, you find everything at a stone's throw distance."

The apartment was compact yet well laid out and never felt cramped. Small touches such as the drinks for sale and Daniel's quick responses made our entire trip stress-free. The photos on Daniel's advert don't do the space the justice it deserves - the views from the balcony were a particular highlight. Thanks for hosting us Daniel!"

There are plenty of nice restaurants and bars nearby. It is a small apartment so I would recommend for a couple or two close friends. Daniel was very quick to respond to any message which was great.

The building is a nice pre-war structure with elevators and automatic doors plus a trash shute on each floor. It is situated in a very friendly and safe neigborhood just outside of downtown (you can even walk downtown if you are not in a hurry). The T station is literatlly 4 minutes walking by foot, meaning that you can be downtown in less than 20 minutes door to door.

Von der Buchung bis zur Wohnungsübergabe und auch während des Aufenthaltes hat alles tip top geklappt. Hanna hat jeweils sofort auf Mails reagiert und war sehr zuvorkommend. Sie hat uns den Weg vom Arlanda Airport zu ihrer Wohnung sehr gut beschrieben (mehrere Varianten) und uns am Bahnhof in Älvsjö abgeholt (obwohl bereits abends spät). Danach hat sie uns alles Nötige über die Wohnung erzählt und die Schlüssel übergeben. Ebenso war der Kühlschrank mit den nötigsten Lebensmitteln gefüllt, Bad- und Küchenwäsche sowie Stadtpläne vorhanden. Die Wohnung wurde in sehr sauberem Zustand übergeben. Sie liegt ruhig gelegen, Nahe des öffentlichen Verkehrs (10 Min. bis Central Station, Verbindungen sehr gut).
Wir können die Wohnung von Hanna und K wärmsten empfehlen. Sie bietet alles, was es für einen angenehmen Stockholmaufenthalt braucht."

O espaço é modesto mas limpo, preenchendo as necessidades básicas de uma estadia curta. A privacidade é limitada, pelo facto de Maud dormir na sala de estar, local de passagem do quarto dos hóspedes para a casa de banho e cozinha. O acesso à cozinha é total, o que possibilita, a quem o quiser, fazer umas refeições mais baratas, fator importante atendendo ao elevado preço dos restaurantes (e de todo o comércio) em Estocolmo. O tempo de deslocação até ao centro é de cerca de 20 minutos. Em resumo, é uma boa opção para quem não quiser gastar muito dinheiro em alojamento."

It's a couple of train stops out of time, but we picked it as it was such a good price compared to others that were more centrally located. You could walk to town if you're happy to walk half an hour. Or if your getting the hop on hop off bus then the stop is 5 mins walk away. Was bigger in person than I thought it looked in pictures which was nice. Everything we needed. Thanks Magnus"

Our family of 5 enjoyed sitting around his large dining room table playing games and catching up with each other . 
We had to communicate with Terry a couple times and with him also on vacation we weren't sure if would hear back from him. 
We promptly heard back from him and want to thank him for his quick responses to our questions and taking the time from his own vaction to make our stay in Stockholm as wonderful as it was. We would also like to thank his neighbor who also was more then willing to help us."

There were absolutly no problems with interection, kitchen and bathroom are yours almost anytime, or you can arrange the special time. Maud is so hospitable, she provided all needed information and gave all instruction about her home. You can ask her whatever you need any time! Room is clean and really cozy, we felt like staying at home. Location is good, it is near 3 minutes walking to the metro (tunnelbana) and 10 minutes to the city-center by metro. Thanks again, Maud, you are great!"

Li is very hospitable and friendly and was very helpful at pointing out the major attractions, ways to get around, and pro tips for those new to Stockholm."

526170,6145921,2013-08-01T00:00:00.000Z,"We heartily recommend Andrea and this apartment for your visit to Stockholm! The location is great – only 3 fast subway stops from the central station. But it is also peaceful and quiet. A real “residential” feel rather than a loud, crowded tourist area. There is a grocery store with everything you need on the street corner (as well as a good pizza shop). A shopping center, library, playground, more restaurants, etc. are one subway stop away (or walking distance). There is also easy access to a vast network of walking and running trails that connect to a large nature reserve on the north side of Stockholm.

The apartment itself is bright and sunny, with big common rooms, a full kitchen, two bathrooms, a dining area, balcony, and two private bedrooms. There is also a shared laundry facility available with top notch washers and dryers. Our family of three had plenty of space to live for 4 weeks comfortably.

Andrea and her family were very friendly and helpful. They were easily accessible to answer questions and would periodically check in to see how we were doing. We would gladly return for another stay. A true asset to airbnb!"

The bus stopped just outside and the subway was just a short walk away. Lots of shops and restaurants in the neigbourhood. We loved the old atmosphere of the building and the apartment, great interior design too. Nice surprise with the toys which our 4yr old really enjoyed, which made the stay even better. We had a very nice time in Stockholm and Alex was very helpful with giving us the information we needed to make our stay great. We got a lot of snow which we wanted, an amazing holiday for us that usually lives in the cold. We would love to come back and stay next time when we are in Stockholm perhaps then in summertime."
624886,5903219,2013-07-22T00:00:00.000Z,"A bright and very nicely furnished apartment in a quiet, but conveniently located neighbourhood. Close to the metro, it is also a very pleasant traffic-free walk into the city centre along the waterfront. Langholmen island is a few minutes walk away (swimming, walking, wild strawberries, etc) and a city park and childrens' play areas are very close by. We really enjoyed our stay here. Oskar was very helpful and made sure we felt right at home. We can highly recommend Stockholm and this apartment too!"
1124388,50114241,2015-10-09T00:00:00.000Z,"If you would like to stay in central Stockholm and near nature, we highly recommend Carl's place. The apartment is clean and cosy. It is just a 3 minute walk away from bus stop and the sea. We like the sunshine in the living room as well. Although the apartment is not large, so does the bed, but my friend and I feel quite comfortable during our stay. Plus, it was really pleased to talk with Carl. He is kind, polite and glad to provide helpful information about the surrounding and Stockholm city. Nice experience in Stockholm."

Supermarket is nearby. The metro station is at 5 minutes so the connectivity is good. And of course, Maud is the most warm and helpful person. Sammy is very cute. I liked playing with him. I would definitely recommend staying here!"

It is very clean and well kept and Per-Marten had been a great host, giving us great recommendations and being available for questions we had during the stay. We would definitely recommend this place for friends and family and hope to some day come back!
(BTW - the location is great, just off the subway, with many great restaurants nearby. It's also pretty close to everything and with a few minutes walk would get you to most places)."

It was great to spend the four nights with a \"homy\" feeling, and your swiftness in replying to emails and text messages was very helpful. I appreciated very much the stay in your flat, enjoying also the perfect location, including the little cafe, Mellqvists, just beside the entrance, where I had my breakfasts. I'd recommend this to anyone going to Stockholm!"

581243,448313398,2019-05-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin was the best host I have ever had with Airbnb. He stayed up late to allow us to check in as our flight arrived quite late in the night which was very nice and accommodating of him. He gave us lots of tips for things to do and about the area that the flat is in. The room was very clean and had everything that we wanted. The location is also very good, it is above a small shopping centre so has everything you need within 1 minute walk. The main attractions of Stockholm are also very close, the apartment is right next to a metro station so getting around is very easy."

The apartment is quite large by Stockholm standards, with a lovely and balcony.  It's in the posh part of town, near all the nightlife, yet totally noise free.

If available, I look forward to staying there again next summer!"

1182616,20221135,2014-09-25T00:00:00.000Z,I didn't meet Peter but was very helpful in giving instructions how to get there. It wasn't clearly mentioned in the listing that there were also (possibly) other guests staying there; however Peter did inform about that and it didn't bother me at all. There was some queuing to the bathroom/shower though. Overall had a nice quick stay!

The apartment is very cute and cosy! Perfect for friends or also for a nice little romantic place to stay as a couple. The location was amazing and literally around the corner were many great cafes, restaurants and shops. The apartment was clean and Daniel had left little notes to explain everything which was very helpful. Sodermalm is a great area to stay in and I would highly recommend Daniel's apartment!"

The apartment is exactly as pictured, surprisingly quiet, and so centrally located and close to the trendy bars, shops, and restaurants in Södermalm.  It is the perfect place to stay to explore Stockholm.  Gamla Stan is a nice and scenic 25 minute stroll away along Katarinavägen.  Safe neighborhood as I walked back to the apartment from Norrmalm/Gamla Stan area most nights with no issues.  Viktor was very prompt and helpful in answering all my questions.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here and would highly recommend this to anyone."

First of all, she is super nice and very friendly, helpful and she was amazing with me coming super late at night because my plane was delayed. 
Her flat is cozy and the room I stayed in is big enough and has its own balcony!

The flat is situated right in the middle of the hipster part of Stockholm, walking distance to city center (15 minutes) and all the bars and nice restaurants.

We had a couple of nice chats with Cor and if there was more time, we would definitely talk much longer! 

Highly recommended!"
795354,269267177,2018-05-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Gustav's place is quite the place. In comparison to most European apartments this one is very spacious with a high ceiling.  It's in the heart of the city. Lots of cafes and restaurants nearby. Two metro stops from Stockholm Central Station.

They let me borrow a metro card (saves about 3€), offered great insights about the city, and had remarkably interesting conversation topics. Loved staying here!"

Then she provided excellent practical information, very easy to find the appartment and she was there to welcome me. Ilona is very nice and  helpful and makes you feel at home. 

I had a perfect stay, the description fits the reality, clear & clean appartment. The view on the parc just across the street is nice and you can enjoy a drink on the terasse after a long day of walking through Stockholm !

The situation is great, I went to the center walking, which takes between 20 and 30 minutes through animated streets (shops...).

I highly recommend staying there !"

Their apartment is large and clean and looks exactly the same pictures shown in the web. The apartment is located in a safe and quite area, and from their place you just need around 20 minute to reach central Stockholm by metro and easily to reach Arlanda airport using SL tickets. Therefore, I strongly recommend Vidhatri apt for your upcoming visit to Stockholm."

He also let us use his kitchen which we highly appreciated.
His appartment is located in a very friendly neighborhood with cafés and a pub just around the corner.
The train station is just down the street (one stop to Stockholm Central Station) and a super market and a 7 eleven just a 2 minute walk away.
The airport shuttle bus stops at St Eriksplan which is a short walk away. We didn't find it difficult at all getting there with our suitcases.
I can definitely recommend staying with Satya and would choose staying with him again if I were going to Stockholm again."
1124388,18395590,2014-08-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Our stay (3 people) in Carl's flat was wonderful. It's really cute, clean and features everything one needs (stove, oven, baking plate, pans, freezer, towels...). For some people the bed (1,20 cm) might be too small to share it, but for us it was no problem. The neighbourhood is very calm and indeed located very close to the city. A bus (Lilla Essingen) or metro station (Thorildsplan) can be reached in a few minutes by foot. 
Carl is a really nice guy, he welcomed us personally and showed us the flat. It was no problem that we arrived rather late and left early. He stayed in the city and offered to help us if we have any problem. I can definitely recommend this flat to everybody! It's close, it's nice and Carl is very friendly."

608672,162745022,2017-06-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Karl was very kind and he told me many important things about the city.  He is very affordable and speakable.

The apartment as posted is about 15-20 sqm. It is a single room, with a bath and a kitchenette.

The location is the best of it.
Apparently it use to be the maid's room from Karl's apartment. So it has it's private entrance, and it comunicates to Karl's by two doors. Both of them are permanently closed, and you also have the ability to lock them from your side.

The bathroom is the lowest point of the room. It is small, and you have to use a water fence, that Karl provides to avoid the water from the shower to wet everything inside. Also as there is only one wood door separating you from Karl's family, you can hear them talking or their tv, which can be a little awkward.

I have been there only two nights so I adapted myself to the situation."
916806,19675232,2014-09-16T00:00:00.000Z,Mansour was a very easy going host. He answered any question we had. The place is cozy and was perfect for the two of us!

Die Lage ist optimal, da man ganz einfach vom Flughafen mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln anreisen kann, die Wohnung ruhig gelegen ist, aber doch genügend Lokale & Einkaufsmöglichkeiten in der Nähe sind. Gamla Stan erreicht man ganz leicht und schnell mit der Metro. Wir haben uns super wohl gefühlt. Check-in und Check-out haben auch unkompliziert funktioniert.

It´s close to everything you could ask for: close to nature, close to shoping & close to the green subway line, connecting Farsta to the rest of Stockholm. But the biggest highlight was the host herself. Kind & considerate, she made sure I felt at home the moment I stepped through the door. Overall: 10/10, would recommend."
