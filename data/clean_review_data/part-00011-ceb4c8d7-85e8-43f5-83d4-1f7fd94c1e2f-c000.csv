1271843,339290911,2018-10-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice-looking home in a great area. Close to trains and buses. Great little Japanese restaurant close by. Best hipster coffee roastery in town at Johan & Nyström. Helpful and flexible with check-in/out times. Instant responses. Overall, very good."
299154,55049465,2015-11-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Daniel's apartment is in a great location and within walking distance to Gamla Stan and the Central Station. It was a good communicating with Daniel as he was very quick to respond and when we met him on the first day, he was very welcoming. He introduced his apartment/neighbourhood and patiently answered our questions about our travel itinerary. His studio apartment is small and cozy with everything I need."

Jeder, der Gefallen an skandinavischem Design hat, wird die Einrichtung lieben, und es fehlte uns an absolut nichts. Wenn man unbedingt ein Haar in der Suppe finden will, dann das relativ kleine Bad, aber die Ausstattung ist insgesamt super. Die Raumaufteilung hat sich nach dem Einbau einer neuen offenen Küche etwas geändert, was uns noch besser gefällt. Überhaupt ist alles in Wirklichkeit (noch) schöner als abgebildet.
Die Lage in Vasastan ist fantastisch - als Ausgangspunkt für Besichtigungen und Shoppingtouren in der Innenstadt, in der Nachbarschaft findet man zahlreiche nette Cafes und Bars und gute Restaurants, und es ist dennoch sehr ruhig.
Mit Sofie haben wir nur per eMail kommuniziert. Das war alles sehr nett und unkompliziert und hat ausnahmslos hervorragend geklappt. Schade, dass wir uns nicht persönlich getroffen haben. Aber vielleicht klappt es ja beim nächsten Mal."
1261445,529655435,2019-09-15T00:00:00.000Z,We had such a wonderful experience here. The place was perfect; in a great locationand with all amenities that we needed.  Most special about this place was the warm welcome and consideration of our host.  We arrived late at night to a warm greeting and they had even bought and had some food available for us which was so helpful and thoughtful. We also got some great tips for places to go to from a locals perspective that made our time there wonderful! We would recommend in a heart beat
1170766,13656708,2014-06-02T00:00:00.000Z,Annika var en mycket tillmötesgående värd som var lätt att få tag på. Vi uppskattade också flexibiliteten vid in- och utcheckning. Lägenheten var supermysig och läget perfekt för oss. Vi skulle gärna bo där igen och rekommenderar det gärna till andra.
1170766,190477098,2017-09-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Annika was an excellent host, very welcoming and friendly. Checkin and communication was easy, the place was great and in a lovely area. I can definitely recommend a stay at Annika's place."
1204621,68179788,2016-04-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Nettan welcomed us back, as we stayed with her for a couple of days, then went to the countryside for a few days, returning to Stockholm - and her apartment - to finish out our trip. I commented earlier about how welcoming and organized she is, and that continues to be true."
873383,89127240,2016-07-27T00:00:00.000Z,Nice place and friendly host.
1170766,445902044,2019-04-30T00:00:00.000Z,Perfect place to discover Stockholm!
1212891,329174588,2018-09-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud (and Sammy the cat) are very welcoming and have a cozy, clean home."
1204621,75325219,2016-05-20T00:00:00.000Z,"I spend 5 nights at Nettan's place while traveling in Stockholm.   Nettan is an awesome host.  She is very friendly, warm and interesting to talk to.  Her flat is very clean.  Her flat is very easily accessible from the train station and the town center with the super efficient and frequent subway.  Her place is about 7 minutes away from the subway station.  Just follow Nettan's clear and easy to follow directions.  For those who enjoy walking, Nettan's flat is about 30-40 minutes of pleasant stroll to the Vasa museum.  You will pass the Swedish Film Institute and the TV station along the way.  The room is actually much better than the picture.  The room is really big and bright.  There is a big window that over looks the harbor.  Everyday, you will see the ferry coming in from Finland in the morning, and leave in the evening.  I love watching the boats going by.  The bed is very comfortable.  I slept like a baby everyday.  Her shower is very luxurious.  It has the rain shower.  It is perfect for washing away the exhaustion of traveling.  There are 2 supermarkets that are few minutes away.  I definitely recommend Nettan's place."
819676,112484051,2016-11-06T00:00:00.000Z,Andy and Vannie went out of their way to make sure I was able to access the apartment in their absence.  They were very responsive to emails and texts.  The description of their apartment was very accurate and the location was terrific.  I would stay here again when I get back to Stockholm.
866768,100900730,2016-09-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Our trip to Stockholm was amazing!
Sally was really nice, she hosted us very spontaneous, because we wrote her a day before we arrived. But it was no problem. And she was waiting for us a long time, because our train was delayed. She was really friendly! Her apartment is also very cozy.

The location is good, a safe place and you can walk to Södermalm in 20 minutes. To walk to the old town or downtown it's too far. But you can easily take the metro, it's very close! 

For the location and the apartment the price is perfect! I can really recommend Sally's apartment."
647314,16649707,2014-07-31T00:00:00.000Z,"deze kamer is echt een aanrader! Ze ligt in een hele rustige buurt!, met vlakbij  winkels, restaurants,  koffiebars, ... Vlakbij was ook de metro  en de fietsparkeerplaats vanwaar we  gehuurde fietsen kon halen. We deden alles  met de  fiets (goeie  fietspaden in  Stockholm!) of te voet.

Mallika  had op voorhand alles duidelijk gecommuniceerd ivm  de kamer, de sleutel, de deurcode, ... De eerste dagen van ons verblijf was  ze zelf niet thuis, maar alles was prima in orde.

Mallika zelf is een hele fijne gastvrouw. Ze respecteert je privacy, ze hielp ons waar ze kon met tips, ... Echt een aangename persoon.

We zouden deze kamer zeker opnieuw huren als we nog eens in Stockholm  komen."
1182616,5622303,2013-07-08T00:00:00.000Z,"My sister Lucy and I had a great few days staying at Peter's place. The apartment was clean, comfy and in a great location for seeing the lovely city of Stockholm. We were able to use the city bike scheme- picking up bikes from very close to the apartment each morning to head out and explore. Peter was a  very kind and friendly host. He was great at communicating prior to our arrival and was there to greet us when we arrived at the apartment on the middle of thee day. He also kindly let us leave our bags in the apartment until our evening flight home on our last day. Thanks for a great stay! We'd love to come back to Stockholm- beautiful city and such friendly people."
819676,127534329,2017-01-19T00:00:00.000Z,This was my first experience with Airbnb and Andy & Vannie made it a great one. Their place is a great location when utlizing the metro.
1035775,69955232,2016-04-15T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a great time staying at Magnus' apartment. The place was as described – a clean apartment near the city center. It was also really a really cozy apartment, fully equipped with everything you need if you don't want to eat out every day. We really felt at home! It is located in a peaceful neighborhood and the subway is close by so it is easy to reach the city center. Magnus was a very welcoming and helpful host. He gave us very clear directions on how to travel directly from the airport to his apartment. We highly recommend this place!"
819676,462708020,2019-06-02T00:00:00.000Z,Thank you Andy~ Awesome place and very big kitchen and living room. l like them. and All was best of best. See you soon Bro!
347192,309306011,2018-08-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Great location on Söder, the boho area of Stockholm, close to excellent restaurants and bars, walking distance to the Old City, the city ferry, etc. You’ll especially love the apartment if you are into Scandinavian design. It’s filled with Pinterest-perfect potted plants, vintage lamps, design books and iconic pieces of furniture artfully blended together."
897730,184631331,2017-08-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Mats is a great and helpful guy! The appartement was very clean and is perfect equipped. The Metro is very close, so you can get to every place quick. If you travel by car there are a lot of parking possibilities (Monday - Friday about 80 SEK per day). All in all we had a very good time in Stockholm.

Thanks to Mats"
1153177,34051657,2015-06-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Terry is amazing! We arrived to a table filled with freshly made pasta, salad, not to mention wine, beer, etc. He was helpful in every way, accommodating some unusual requests, and making sure everything was wonderful. 

The apartment is spacious and in a very nice part of town. Good Internet (can't speak to TV, don't really watch when we travel), equipped kitchen, beautiful balconies for sitting outside (if you get better weather than we did)."
581243,425405262,2019-03-18T00:00:00.000Z,"It was a great place to stay. Good location, walking distance to central Stockholm, or take local train few minutes walk. Its above a shoping mall, many choices to eat and shop! Edwin was a excellent host, very friendly."
299154,228862210,2018-01-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Bra läge, och trevlig värd som svarar snabbt"
755843,138725473,2017-03-21T00:00:00.000Z,Lägenheten ligger perfekt för de som vill gärna upptäcka stan. Man kan promenera vid mälaren till centrum/Gamla Stan. Det finns olika busslinjer just rund hörnet. Lägenheten själv är i ett lugnt hus och sängen är verkligen bekväm. Pär är en jättesnäll gästgivare. Han visade runt och hadde mycket information förberedd för oss. Det var trevligt att stanna hos honom. Tack!
647314,455124278,2019-05-19T00:00:00.000Z,Mallika is a very nice host.   Check-In & Check-Out works perfect. The appartement is very good located and quiet big. We definitely come back!
974175,93062875,2016-08-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Absolutely lovely place! Jesper and Sofie left clear and easy to follow instructions and lots of helpful tips. The home is exceptionally well designed and kept, and located in a safe and convenient neighbourhood. Just a stone's throw from Odenplan station. Also it's smack in the middle of three Pokestops!"
259025,894265,2012-01-31T00:00:00.000Z,"The house is really nice and the bedroom is cozy.The only problem is that the room is in the third floor and the bathroom is in the ground floor. It is just 15 minutes from the center of stockholm , and Ali is really helpful. He helped us with metro's issues, and still borrowed us a a big useful map of the city. There are some little restaurants and a supermarket in the neighborhood . We really recommend ali, we couldn't have made a better choice."
1262520,16930070,2014-08-04T00:00:00.000Z,The reservation was canceled 9 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1212891,97901442,2016-08-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud's place was great!! Everything was functional and very clean. We had everything at out disposal that we needed. Maud was super helpful while planning our outings into Stockholm and was very friendly and welcoming. The place is a little far out of the city but we actually preferred that, as we had a chance to sit back and enjoy Swedish life by the waterside and joined the Swedes in tanning and exercising along the brilliant walkways and bikeways around the islands. The bike lanes were very impressive and made a trip to the city quite quick and enjoyable especially when you can take a stop at one of the many cafes along the way. The nearest hire bike station was a little walk away but we didn't mind, as we had great weather.
Thank you for your hospitality Maud. You made our stay in Stockholm very welcoming and enjoyable!"
1182616,56607879,2015-12-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Good location, near the city center, very continent! Warm and feel like home, but shared bath room and kitchen."
755843,113550784,2016-11-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Real nice place to stay. Close to the metro. Shops, bars and restaurants in walking distance. Would book again! Pär is also dead sound."
1212891,192755304,2017-09-11T00:00:00.000Z,We loved staying in Maud's apartement. She gave us a very warm welcome and we instantly felt like home. The room was very clean and connection to public transport was easy. We can totally recommend staying here.
242188,77622129,2016-06-02T00:00:00.000Z,She gave info on neighborhood
785218,175879546,2017-07-30T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a lovely time here while in Stockholm with the family.
The home is fantastic and well suited to children.
Would definitely stay again next time we are in Stockholm."
357012,59158804,2016-01-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Lägenheten var ljus, ren, vacker och välkomnande. Värden svarade fort och var mycket trevlig att ha att göra med. 

Vi är väldigt nöjda och kan verkligen rekommendera detta boende."
581243,2891352,2012-11-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin is a very friendly host. The room and bathroom are spotless and very clean and comfortable. I was attending a conference in Stockholm, and I found Edwin's room much better and cheaper than staying in a hotel. I have no hesitation to recommend this place to anybody. Enjoy!"
581243,75154558,2016-05-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin was perfect in his instructions on how to reach the apartment and we had a really warm welcome. The description of the apartment is absolutely accurate and the neighbourhood was really nice with respect to connectivity to all tourist places and the city center via bus/metro. The apartment is very clean and tidy and the kitchen was fully equipped to cook your own food. One thing which we did not like was the flexible checkout time which was mentioned in the description. We reached at around 7PM and we had our return, the next day at 7PM. So, we were told (a bit rudely!) that we can keep our luggage outside the room after 11AM but we should not be in the house after 12PM, as they were expecting another guest and they did not want many people in the house. Also there was a bit of language problem (English) speaking with them and that made it a bit uncomfortable. Uncomfortably, we kept our luggage there till 5PM and then we came back, picked it up and left. Apart from this, everything was good."
581243,190813290,2017-09-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin was great to communicate with, he explained how to get to his place very clearly and gave me a lot of information. His apartment was extremely clean and he was very welcoming and friendly. He also gave us a lot or information on how to get around the city and enjoy our stay. Would definitely recommend :)"
700113,2974774,2012-11-26T00:00:00.000Z,"I have been staying at Ilona apartment for 3 nights. It was very nice, clean and comfortable place where I could feel myself as at home which  I value so much. It is quiet place in central Stockholm for a reasonable price in spite Ilona has several pets. Ilona is very helpful, warm and friendly host and I would definitely recommend to choose this place to stay in central Stockholm and If I am at Stockholm again I would prefer to stay here again."
283446,87997299,2016-07-22T00:00:00.000Z,Our hosts Vidhatri and Bala made us feel extremely welcome.  Vidha had some food ready for us when we arrived and provided a lovely breakfast each morning - indian or to our choosing.  She also found us a safe place to leave our bikes.  Vidha helped us with information on using the underground and trains were so easy and regular to get into the centre of Stockholm.  Vidha and Bala also arranged our washing!! We would thoroughly recommend using Comfort Stay.
757320,185222004,2017-08-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Das Zimmer war sauber und schön vorbereitet mit Obst und Wasser. Das Bad war ebenfalls schön sauber und geräumig mit Badewanne.
Die einzige Schwierigkeit war, dass Barb direkt vor der Ankunft lieber über SMS oder Telefon kommunizieren wollte als über Airbnb, während ich kein gutes Telefonnetz hatte sondern nur mobiles Internet. Das hat zu ein paar unvollständigen Informationen geführt. Am Ende hat aber doch alles geklappt."
164448,51584778,2015-10-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Det gamle arbejderkvarter Södermalm har sin egen charme, og er markant anderledes end de andre Stockholmske kvarterer.

Nem adgang til hele byen - både til fods og via toge, der kører regelmæssigt"
1170766,18907448,2014-09-02T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed 3 nights in this nice studio. It's perfectly located (4 min to Metro, 3 min to direct Bus to Gamla Stan and the ferries). The area Södermalms is very cosy and has lots of nice bars and little restaurants. The studio is very bright, windows on 2 sides, and we enjoyed breakfast on the little balcony. Annika was very friendly and helpfull and organisation was reliable and fast. Thanks for the nice stay!!"
1244657,6664195,2013-08-20T00:00:00.000Z,"The location is perfect! Had a great time. Usha was lovely, the apartment was nice, comfy, and clean, and both Nic and Usha responded quickly to every concern or question I had."

really clean and the host is very heartwarming."
700113,75025461,2016-05-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Ilona was very welcoming and helpful.  While bedding in the photo is different, the other aspects were accurate.  The wifi worked well."
1262188,16651087,2014-07-31T00:00:00.000Z,"Nous n'avons pas eu la chance de rencontrer notre propriétaire.
Cependant, elle était très disponible par mail, ce que nous avons apprécié, et nous avons récupéré les clés dans un supermarché à quelques mètres de l'appartement.
L'appartement est confortable et bien équipé: lave linges, lave vaisselles,
ainsi que tous les produits de première nécessité (papier toilette, bain douche, produits ménagers, sel, poivre, sucre, épices, céréales, huile...)
Les lits sont confortables, et l'appartement agréable, en particulier la terrasse où nous avons pris tous nos petits déjeuners.
Le quartier est agréable également avec un parc de jeux pour les enfants: balançoires, stade de foot...
Les sanitaires et la cuisine sont très propres, ainsi que les draps et linges de toilette.
Seul petit bémol: l'appartement est légèrement poussiereux, mais ce n'est pas du tout génant vu toutes les qualités de l'appartement citées plus haut, et son emplacement à un peu moins de 500 mètres du métro.
Nous recommandons donc cet appartement."
776012,482900185,2019-07-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Majken is a 5 star host 
Very friendly welcome, gave us all recommendations needed for our stay in Stockholm

688947,158130937,2017-06-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Alexandre is extremely helpful host! He very good organized (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication was easy. Room is clean. Just few meters from T-bana (metro station). Close to big LIDL (grocery store). 20 min. by T-bana to city center. Building just accross bus stop of night bus to city center. So, location is GREAT! Strong Wi-Fi. HIGHLY recommended!!!"

954832,453571939,2019-05-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Mikael’s apartment was the perfect place to stay during our trip. It is quite, in a nice area, an the apartment itself is cute and very clean! Mikael greeted us when we arrived and was incredibly helpful, messaging me once in a while to make sure we didn’t have any questions, or need any assistance. It was a a lovely place to stay, and we would definitely come back."

The view from the room is very beautiful and made me relax and happy.
I could use 3 supermarkets and the metro station is 5 mins away from the accommodation.
Anyway Nettan is a very nice lady, I am sure that you will enjoy her place very much!!!
Thank you so much Nettan ;)"
1048260,303751631,2018-08-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Great interior and balcony on the top floor, cool bohemian vibe. Lots of house plants. About 5-10 minute walk to the Gullmarsplan station and surrounding shops. Annika was really helpful with everything!"

242188,253390923,2018-04-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Li's place was as advertised. The bed in the single room was super comfortable. The location is terrific...close to multiple transit options, especially the train station from the airport. You can easily walk to Gamla Stan and Slussen. Most importantly, Li herself is a terrific host. She is extremely informative and pleasant to communicate with. She can give you a great lay of the land."
1182616,185657517,2017-08-22T00:00:00.000Z,Peter is an amazing host so easy going that leaves the impression that you've known him your entire life. I definately recommend him.
1212891,461708077,2019-06-01T00:00:00.000Z,"We really enjoyed our stay at Maud’s place. The room is small but cozy and perfect for a couple that wants to visit Stockholm during the day and spend the night in a quiet and peaceful neighborhood outside the city center. Plus, Maud and her cat are discreet but very helpful hosts.    
Thanks again Maud for your kindness !"

628555,52761147,2015-11-01T00:00:00.000Z,"It was great staying with Helle! The apartment ist nice and cosy and it was so easy to stay in touch with her via txt. It was very clean and looked very stylish. Even though there is not a lot of room, you have everything you need - perfect for two people. 

The ride into town with the underground takes about 15 minutes. We always walked to the closest underground station which is another 15 minustes away, but it's a nice walk - we had great weather. 

I would really recommend staying the Helle! Thanks again!"
916806,11805343,2014-04-15T00:00:00.000Z,Mansour was a great host. They live above the flat which was handy to get and return the key. The flat was very nice and had a terrace overlooking the water and nature. It was close to the metrostation and several shops.
647314,449160312,2019-05-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Mallika's home is a beautifully furnished apartment in a nice neighbourhood. A metro station is close by but I found the short walk to Old Town a pleasant one. Mallika is a very helpful and accommodating host, before and during my stay. A bonus is her pair of cats who pay a visit to the room occasionally. I would recommend Mallika's home to anyone visiting the great city of Stockholm."
974175,264072251,2018-05-13T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a lovely stay at Sofie and Jesper's place.
The apartment was absolutely beautiful and the communication worked perfectly. They had prepared a very useful instruction/guide package for us which was very much appreciated, and the apartment was super clean, modern and beautifully decorated.
The location is perfect as well, everything is within walking distance.
We would definitely recommend their apartment for everyone going to Stockholm!

We were a group of four friends staying for two nights."
442837,1260177,2012-05-10T00:00:00.000Z,As described. Comfortable bed. Nice neighborhood. Underground station 1 min away is very convenient. Afternoon sun on the balcony. Happy to recommend!
533880,14384286,2014-06-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Jarl had been a friendly and very flexible host. 
We had a good time in Stockholm and enjoyed our stay very much. 
The area in which the apartment is located is close to the city. Thanks for the bike cards - this made a perfect city cruising day."
854975,520593830,2019-08-30T00:00:00.000Z,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
954832,6730491,2013-08-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Excellent location, 2 stops from centralstation and has a cheap supermarket nearby if you want to cook. Mikael was very attentive and his studio is equipped with everything you need. Mikael was very kind to lend me his washing machine for use. Even has a coffee machine for guests!"
608672,196752178,2017-09-24T00:00:00.000Z,"I'm very glad that i chose Karls' apartment for my weekend, cause it's the optimal price-quality-locarion ratio. It's great that Karl keeps in contact, answering the questions and meils very fast, also he gave exhaustive informaition how to get to the house and about apartments themselves. Clean, cozily, all things in working condition. The best choice for single or couple travellers, who are plannig to spend plenty of their time autside, walking around the city, cooming back to house to have a comfortable short rest. If I decide to visit Stockholm once more, I'll try to return here."
647314,41917983,2015-08-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Lovely flat, great, spacious and comforable room in very convenient location. Can walk everywhere from the apartment. Malika was very easy to communicate with and helpful with information on arrival. Thank you!"
536283,9234178,2013-12-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Awesome stay at Paolo's, the flat was clean, very practical, well located, and Paolo has been lovely with us, very communicative and helpful. I highly recommend his place!"
647314,166391760,2017-07-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Le logement de Mallika est très bien placé à deux pas du métro !
Nous avons croisé une fois Mallika durant notre séjour. Tout s'est très bien passé !"
748847,15323796,2014-07-07T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a wonderful time! Amazing apartment, excellent area and superb help from the owner. Clean. Quiet all was perfect!!"
819676,147891632,2017-04-29T00:00:00.000Z,"The place is very clean and perfect for two, in the heart of Stockholm."
299154,104022313,2016-09-25T00:00:00.000Z,"The location of the apartment is fantastic. Its in the centre of town and the old city is a 7-8 min walk and the metro is a min walk. Daniel was very responsive and communicated the details of the arrival, checkin and etc in advance. He was also co-operative for the extension of our check out time as we had a late flight. The only point (as Daniel) has mentioned, the apartment is a bit small and we were three people, so was bit packed for us."
299154,30349819,2015-04-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Daniel’s flat is very well located, a good starting point to visit Stockholm by walking, getting back to rest if you need it; groceries and pubs round the corner.
The flat is as described, there is everything you can need. It’s a studio flat, the size is perfect for two people, ok for four friends. No problem with the organization (Daniel was waiting us, etc.)
Recommended to people who are visiting the city as a tourist"
302496,268150497,2018-05-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Sera’s home was a wonderful spot for our family’s Stockholm adventure. The location is super convenient to public transportation, restaurants, cafes, parks and everything in between!

Seat greeted us personally upon arrival to show us around the apartment which is breathtakingly beautiful. The ceilings are soaring and the natural light is abundant. We traveled with our toddler and our hosts provided us with a travel crib, high chair and an extensive amount of toys to keep our young one entertained, it was above and beyond!

The apartment itself is lovely and quite large with numerous interesting art pieces, an extensive collection of books, 2 bathrooms, comfortable furniture, a beautifully updated modern kitchen and laundry area - which was very convenient to have while traveling with a 2 year old.

We were extremely happy with our stay and will certainly return again when we visit our family next time around. Seta is super responsive to inquiries and very kind to engage with."
897584,52148234,2015-10-26T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment is nice and cozy and has everything you need. The bed is 120 cm and works for a couple who likes to sleep close. We were given towels and coffee and tee, which was a nice gesture. Viveka is the perfect hostess! She met us at the train station and gave us the key, and let us keep our luggage in the apartment until we left for the airport Sunday evening. She also checked in on us by sms during our stay to see if we needed something.
The apartment is a 5 minutes walk from the subway station, and it takes about 8 minutes to Södermalm and 13 minutes to Gamla Stan. So it's not super central, but not far away either. I would have like to stay a little closer to the city center, but we had a great stay, and would absolutely recommend Viveka's apartment."
581243,453887871,2019-05-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Wonderful place.  Super-convenient to have a nice, up-scale shopping experience directly below the apartment.  Beautiful place in a great location.  Edwin was very gracious, helpful, and thoughtful."
1048668,181186421,2017-08-12T00:00:00.000Z,"We enjoyed staying at Malissa's place. It was comfortable, very clean, tidy, well-organized and nicely decorated. The bed was very comfortable. Our daughter slept on the couch with bedding provided. There was enough space for the 3 of us. The kitchen was well-equipped, though we only used it for making breakfast. Here a little disappointment since the description and many guests mentioned breakfast being provided: Maybe Melissa was in a rush and couldn't provide it for us because we found only some cheese and jam in the fridge. Hosts usually don't provide food, so that was fine and we made our own breakfast. Melissa communicated with us via email and texts and did it very promptly and gave good advice and directions how to get to her apartment and the airport. We also used her recommendations for local restaurants. We visited the same restaurant twice because the food was very good. We wanted to try traditional Swedish food and the place that offered potato dumplings and meatballs was great. Thank you for recommending it, Melissa! The apartment is located in a quiet residential area with many small apartment houses in natural looking landscape. We walked to both T stations (about 700 m, under 10 min walk) when traveling to the center for sightseeing, and took a bus from right outside the apartment when traveling with luggage. We wish we had stayed longer to explore the area near the apartment for all the attractions Melissa mentioned. We had a pleasant stay and recommend Melissa's place to other visitors to Stockholm."
776012,84487204,2016-07-07T00:00:00.000Z,I stayed in Majken's place for 4 nights in July. The apartment is a lovely cozy one bed at the top of an old building. The location is stunning - couldn't me more central in Gamla Stan. The place was spotless and would definitely stay again when in Stockholm!
620848,2968132,2012-11-26T00:00:00.000Z,"It is the tremendous apartment, pure, very cozy in which there is all necessary for pleasant rest! 
The apartment to be near the station, the convenient transport message (Arland's airport or the city center).
 Hanna left to us many fresh and tasty products - I arrived at night and it was very pleasant! The drugstore, shop is a row. 
This apartment only for those who loves quiet and comfortable rest. I plan will return only to Hanna next time!  
Hanna & K thanks!
Это потрясающая квартира,чистая, очень уютная,  в которой есть все необходимое для приятного отдыха! 
Квартира находиться рядом со станцией,  удобное транспортное сообщение (аэропорт Арланда или центр города).

 Ханна оставила нам много свежих и вкусных продуктов - я прилетела ночью и это было очень приятно! Рядом есть аптека, магазин. 
Эта квартира только для тех, кто любит спокойный и комфортный  отдых. Планирую вернутся только к Hanna в следующий раз!  
Спасибо Hanna & K!"
1170766,26397034,2015-02-11T00:00:00.000Z,"This was my second stay in Annika's studio, now my favorite place to stay in Stockholm (and I have several good spots in the city!). Not only is Annika a warm, friendly and caring hostess, but the place is huge, comfortable and very well appointed. I particularly like the kitchen, with everything you need to make your own meals, and of course the light everywhere, from the east- and west-facing windows and the skylights. Combined with a perfect location, it's really hard to resist, and worth every one of the stairs to get up to it!"
822497,18518916,2014-08-28T00:00:00.000Z,"We just loved the apartment, the location. It was perfect! We definitely would return, and urge anyone going to Stockholm to stay here. Thank you to Moa, she was very kind and helpful as well. We miss Stockholm already."
819676,132681743,2017-02-19T00:00:00.000Z,We totally enjoyed our stay in Andys and Vannies apartment. It's perfectly located in the middle of everything. Recommendation!
313763,121819635,2016-12-19T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed in Martin's apartment for a month in winter, for business. The location is fantastic, 3 stops on the Metro from the central station and a 10/15 min walk from the centre. There are shops, restaurants and cafes close by and the view from the balcony is great. There is plenty of space and the apartment has a cosy homely feel. Had a really enjoyable time in Stockholm, it is a beautiful city."
1212891,27584865,2015-03-08T00:00:00.000Z,The room is really cute with all facilities. Maud is friendly and helpful and has arranged her house in guest friendly way. She gave us the access to her kitchen too.  The locality is awesome with a close metro and bus station and beach and a supermarket.
739726,13874059,2014-06-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Sanna is a lovely lady.  I met her at the apartment and chatted with her and immediately felt like I had known her for a long time.  I recently stayed at Sanna's apartment in Sodermalm for 5 nights and it was lovely.  Her apartment was as shown in her profile and within a vibrant neighbourhood.  The location of the apartment is perfectly situated, with lots of little shops and restaurants within a short walking distance.  There are a number of supermarkets nearby (take your pick).  You can also easily walk to Gamla Stan in under 30 minutes, but the metro is very convenient.  Make sure you ask Sanna about the location of the charming cottages in the neighbourhood and the lookout walk at the edge of Sodermalm."
608672,28779075,2015-03-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Sehr zu empfehlen! Die Lage ist perfekt, man ist in 10 Minuten zu Fuß beim Arlanda Express und die Einkaufsstrasse ist gleich um die Ecke. Das Zimmer ist zwar klein, aber vollkommen ausreichend für ein Wochenende in Stockholm. Karl ist entzückend und sehr hilfsbereit. Außerdem spricht er perfekt deutsch!"
1189469,54180275,2015-11-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Wow!!  Perfect location, chic fabulous apartment, seamless arrival and departure.  Airbnb at it's best!!!  Thank you Isabelle for making my birthday stay in Stockholm wonderful:)"
628555,6876844,2013-08-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Anna's flat exceeded our expectations. It was only a quick 10 minute journey into central Stockholm and was located in a very safe, peaceful neighbourhood. Her apartment is beautiful and was immaculate. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Anna's apartment and only wish we had time to stay longer!"
688947,184862939,2017-08-20T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed at Alexandre's with two persons. He accepted our request spontaneously, we were very greatful for this because there was no other affordable accommodation available that day. Thanks again for that! :)
Alexandre was a very nice host and gave us some advice for sights in Stockholm. He gave us access to his whole flat, even his Playstation and instruments. 
Nevertheless the photos in this announcement are not up to date, since he moved. His new flat, which is situated in a very diverse neighbourhood, is not completely furnished yet and didn't feel homelike at first sight. 
All in all we are satisfied and very thankful for a roof over our head for two nights."
278311,2664781,2012-10-20T00:00:00.000Z,"My stay at Linnea's was significant, the house is nice with nice views..
Linnea is easy going and makes you feel comfortable, always smiling and happy, didn't have much time in my stay to get to know her more, but would definitely repeat my stay to do that :)
Thanks Linnea"
757320,45674329,2015-09-05T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a lovely stay at Barb's place in Sodermalm. The location is perfect with lots of cafes, restaurants, bars around. Barb was a helpful host and made us feel at home very quickly."
274876,4560039,2013-05-13T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed at Emma's place for 8 days. She met us in person upon arrival and she offered us many useful recommendations. The apartment was in great condition and the location perfect. Walking distance to Gamla Stan and Sødermalm, which are great areas.
My best recommendations to Emma and her apartment!"
1153177,17267774,2014-08-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Terry nous avait préparé un repas de midi très typique avec du saumon et une sauce tellement délicieuse que nous n'en avons pas retrouvé l'équivalent par la suite dans STOCKHOLM ! notre famille \"élargie\" a vraiment apprécié ce repas, surtout après un voyage bousculé et une arrivée à ARLANDA retardée. Ce retard nous a empêché de profiter de l'expérience de Terry qui n'avait plus beaucoup de temps à consacrer à notre accueil. Heureusement nous avons pu le revoir en milieu de séjour.
La situation de l'appartement correspond tout à fait à l'annonce faite par Terry."
897584,6901861,2013-08-29T00:00:00.000Z,"It was our first experience with Airbnb and it was a great one! Viveka is a great host, very helpful, and it was really easy to organize our arrival. 
The apartment is really nice, clean, comfortable and cosy. Peaceful and quiet, with a charming patio. 
It is located in the middle of a small forest, but at 15 min from the main center by metro... perfect!
We highly recommend her place!
Thank you Viveka!"
700113,475465965,2019-06-24T00:00:00.000Z,What is advertised! A very quiet and well situated place! I would go back in a pinch! ❤️
700113,9275700,2013-12-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Wonderful stay at Ilona studio. A very good location, around 15 min from central Stockholm. Small kitchen and cozy bedroom."

1262188,41727800,2015-08-09T00:00:00.000Z,"We really enjoyed staying in Karin's apartment. We found the space to be accurate as advertised and it served as a comfortable home base for us while we visited Stockholm for a swimming competition. Karin's place is very well-located within the Södermalm area of Stockholm.

It was very easy to stay in contact with Karin before and during our stay. She was very flexible and understanding with us when our flights were delayed and we were not able to arrive at the place on time. She gave us very good directions for arriving and departure, and for finding her place."
608672,127679429,2017-01-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Awesome place! 
Awesome guest! 
Totally worth it, we will come back next year! Counting the days"
647314,60578555,2016-01-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Notre séjour a Stockholm chez Mallika fut un rêve. Elle a ete très flexible quant aux heures d'arrivée et de départ, ce qui nous a bien aidé. La chambre était identique aux photos, l'appartement d'une propreté impeccable, en plus d'être parfaitement localisé dans le tres hip Sodermalm, a une distance de marches de plusieurs café, stations de métro et plus encore."
954832,18834795,2014-09-01T00:00:00.000Z,Staying here was wonderful! The apartment was super clean and tidy and the hosts were very welcoming and helpful in getting us situated for our visit with recommendations about things to see and do and how to navigate the local community. Our two year old daughter enjoyed being able to sleep in the bench-bed. The bed was very comfortable. The only slight downside was that laundry was downstairs and had the be scheduled to use. We probably could have handled that but we just had too much other stuff going on. :-)
283446,30973073,2015-04-30T00:00:00.000Z,"It was lovely living with Vidhi and her family...
It was like a home away from home... :)
would love to visit them again..."
1212891,72475065,2016-05-02T00:00:00.000Z,Maud was friendly and extremely helpful in planning our trip and giving up directions. The room was exactly as portrayed and her location is quite easy to get to from the center of Stockholm. It is also within walking distance from Bromma airport!
608672,134827727,2017-03-01T00:00:00.000Z,Very clean well located! I recommend it
1124388,18875331,2014-09-02T00:00:00.000Z,"We were two people and stay for eight days in Carls apartment. We had a wonderful stay in Carls apartment. 
Good location, near the city. We really enjoy it to swim in the lake. Please take a hammock with you! ☺ There are attachment for those (at the lake)! 
I recommend this place."
755843,404513361,2019-01-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice place, right next to the bus station, quite big! We really liked it, also the location is really convenient because Stockholm is quite a small town, so you can easily reach all of the landmarks.

Pär is a great host, he left us a bottle of champagne as a welcome gift! All in all everything is as described, so we fully recommend visiting his place! :)"
1182616,63479555,2016-02-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Good location right next to a well-connected subway stop. The apartment was very comfortable with a nice degree of privacy and good kitchen and bathroom/shower. A bit far from the center of Stockholm with all of the bars/clubs, but this is extremely easy to get to via subway and it is worth how nice the apartment is."
1271843,11969012,2014-04-20T00:00:00.000Z,"André pretty much sets the bar for hosting.  Couldn't have asked for more with his hospitality and wealth of knowledge of where to go in Stockholm.  What's hot, what's not, and all the insider tips for various neighborhoods proved to be a real help in navigating through all that this great city has to offer.  Even moreso,  André was very generous with his time in getting me situated and comfortable in his place along with a tour of his neighborhood.  If you want a real insider's guide to Stockholm along with a friendly, easygoing host then this is the place."
1212891,15269776,2014-07-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud was nice and generous, already while planning my trip she gave me a lot of information and helped me find what I was seeking.
She welcomed me with open hands a big smile, and as I got sick she did all her best to make me feel better, with medicines etc.
Very lovely person for conversation!
Made me feel at home in her lovely flat.
I will definitely come back :)"
757320,265710898,2018-05-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Barb is a great host,very accommodating and helpful. Her place feel like home, near everything. Metro, restaurants, groceries and Gamla Stan.We would certainly return to Barb."
608672,15946809,2014-07-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Karl ist wirklich ein sehr netter Vermieter. Und natürlich hatten auch wir die von vielen schon angesprochene Flasche Wasser im Kühlschrank. 

Und ja: Das Bad ist völlig überflutet, wenn man duscht, aber die baulichen Gegebenheiten lassen es anderes halt einfach nicht zu und das ist dann auch schon okay.

Was wir viel störender fanden - unabhängig davon, dass Karl wirklich total nett ist - dass wir durch die Türen jedes Wort, jede Musik, einfach alles von Karl und seiner Frau mitbekommen haben (und umgekehrt halt auch). 

Wir haben uns dadurch mehr als WG-Bewohner statt als Appartement-Inhaber gefühlt, was wir uns anders erhofft hatten. 

Kochen ist in der Küche tatsächlich gar nicht möglich, weil man dort auch nicht spülen kann. Das muss man dann im Bad tun (was in der Regel überflutet ist :-) ). 

Nunja, die Lage ist halt perfekt. Und dementsprechend ist es definitiv eine gute Adresse. Zumindest dann, wenn das Wetter passt und man viel draußen sein kann. 

Ganz herzlichen Dank noch einmal lieber Karl und weiterhin alles Gute!"
900043,130209747,2017-02-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Good basic place, cheap and good location both for public transport and for walking. Would be good if it was stated more clearly that there's no wifi. We missed being able to open the window, but would definitely recommend this place."
1271843,439992724,2019-04-20T00:00:00.000Z,"I really can't imagine you will find better for your trip. André was a great, highly responsive host. The apartment was fantastic, bigger than expected and if you're a fan of Scandinavian mid-century design then the perfect accompaniment to your experience. 
The location was also ideal for us, so much is walkable from his place we only ever needed to take public transport when getting to/from the airport and when there was a larger body of water requiring ferry!"
739726,145454790,2017-04-18T00:00:00.000Z,We had a wonderful stay at Sannas apartment. Sanna was so friendly and helpful. Also this area of  Sodermälm was close to everything we needed and wanted. I'd repeat a stay here and highly recommend you do as well.
723539,74434428,2016-05-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Mathias was quick to respond after our arrival at Arlanda. Though he wasn't able to greet us with the keys, he left straightforward instructions for finding them. The apartment is comfortable, and the photos in the listing are accurate. The balcony would especially be enjoyable in the summertime. The place is a short walk to the metro, and there are also interesting bars and restaurants in the area. We especially enjoyed being near the Ostermalm Saluhall. If you don't need wifi, this is overall a good place to stay."
700113,358641844,2018-12-15T00:00:00.000Z,"I can’t recommend it enough. The place is super clean, comfortable and with everything one might need. The balcony and its view are beautiful. I loved it."
1182616,16567859,2014-07-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Peter`s flat is cozy, very clean and fully equipped. We always had a good sleep and enjoyed our stay. Bike rent, Buses, T-bana and grocery are right in front of the door. A nice park is located in the back. Recommendable pretty place."
1204621,208599675,2017-11-02T00:00:00.000Z,Nettan was very friendly and easy going. The room and bathroom are very clean and spacious and the bed is comfortable. I highly recommend Nettan’s place for anyone staying in Stockholm!
556363,64295391,2016-03-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Très bon accueil de Lennard qui nous a très vite dit de nous sentir comme chez nous. L'appartement est très fidèle aux photos du site internet et le volume de la salle à manger/cuisine communiquant avec celui du salon est très agréable. L'exposition est excellente et permet de prendre son petit déjeuner en plein soleil. La localisation de l'appartement avec le métro S:T Eriksplan au pied de l'immeuble nous a permis de rayonner dans toute la ville avec une bonne partie à pieds (compter 30 minutes pour rejoindre Gamlastan à pieds). Bref, un super appart' pour un super séjour !"
1212891,34882456,2015-06-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud was a great hostess for me and my 10-year-old son! She was very helpful and gave us a lot of useful tips where to go and what to do, that were better than those in the guide book. We felt very comfortable in her flat. The cats were well-behaved and cuddly. Maud kept the flat very clean all the time. Highly recommended! :-)"
338470,1104818,2012-04-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Our stay at Gustaf's apartment could not have been better. Great location, great size, super secure, comfy bed, excellent shower and awesome communication. Gustaf was away for the w'end but his girlfriend met us to hand over keys (even though we were more than 40 mins late) and passed on local information and some handy maps and pamphlets Gustaf had left behind for us. 

I'll be recommending this place to all my friends and family who visit Stockholm."
299154,19263125,2014-09-09T00:00:00.000Z,We had a fantastic few days in Stockholm and the location of Daniel's apartment couldn't have been better.  You have everything you need on your doorstep. The apartment is small but it is clean and was perfect for my friend and I. Daniel answered all my questions before I arrived and communicates very well and quickly.  Perfect if you're just looking somewhere clean to sleep at night while you explore the beautiful city of Stockholm. I would definitely stay again.
1204621,470324190,2019-06-16T00:00:00.000Z,위치가 가장 좋아요. 찾기 쉽고 중앙역이랑 가까워요. 여름에는 좀 많이 더울 것 같아요. 창문열면 벌레 많이 들어와서 그게 좀 아쉬워요. 다른건 다 괜찮아요.
873383,202604943,2017-10-12T00:00:00.000Z,Good place to stay in Stockholm with a very friendly host!

581243,62858517,2016-02-17T00:00:00.000Z,"A friend and I stayed overnight in Edwin's room and had a fine time. His place is VERY conveniently located to the subway station, which made navigating the city while under a tight schedule much easier. The room wasn't huge but the bed was which made sleeping much easier. He keeps his place very clean and let us use his kitchen which was very nice. He even let us keep our bags in the apartment past checkout time as our flight out was very late. Overall a pleasant experience and I would certainly recommend it to a friend."
1244657,197371823,2017-09-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Nic & Usha has been terrific nice host.  I've really enjoyed meeting them. The place is very well located, close to a lot of very interesting places.  Metro and bus stations are just aside, so very easy to reach any Stockholm points of interest."
739726,19363694,2014-09-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Sanna was a great host. I didn't have a chance to meet her in person, though my mother did at the end of our stay. That said, Sanna was very accommodating and easy to communicate with via email. Both my mother and I enjoyed the neighbourhood, Södermalm, immensely. There were numerous terrific bars, cafes, and restaurants all within blocks. We were lucky to have great weather and were able to walk all over Stockholm, however the place was very close to a subway stop. The apartment itself was very clean and welcoming. We didn't spend much time at the apartment, but the size seemed just fine for two people. Thanks Sanna!"
347192,24001379,2014-12-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Really lovely apartment! Perfect location, close to everything you would need, nice cafes, shops, supermarkets. Really close to public transport! We enjoyed getting the ferry across to Skansen to go to the amazing park there, with a wonderful christmas market! Very clean apartment, like someone mentioned before there is now a very comfy sofa! Cool interior design too. Thanks so much for letting us stay!!"
1244657,292566500,2018-07-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Perfect location and perfect hosts! I spent over a week at their place for a conference and some holidays, and I'm super happy I did =)"
763407,521713696,2019-09-01T00:00:00.000Z,Gabriellas apartment was perfect for three people to stay. It is located close to a metro station and great for exploring the city. Communication with Gabriella was uncomplicated and she was very accommodating. I can highly recommend it - thank you very much!
700113,25998224,2015-02-01T00:00:00.000Z,"This was the second time I stayed in Ilona's Studio Apartment, and as before, I was very happy with my stay. It's a small but cozy apartment with a practical layout. The studio is centrally located but quiet, with a balcony that overlooks the park opposite. Ilona is a lovely host, friendly and helpful."
1271843,529923031,2019-09-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Staying with André was an absolute treat. He is a fantastic host who's tips and recommendations we're always spot on. The apartment is immaculately clean. It's centrally located in a very good neighborhood, and has easy access to public transit. All around, this is one of the best Airbnbs I have ever stayed in."
170651,404805888,2019-01-25T00:00:00.000Z,Very nice place and a great location!!
581243,450693927,2019-05-10T00:00:00.000Z,Would recommend. Would stay again.
299154,446304038,2019-05-01T00:00:00.000Z,Many thanks for the great accommodation and hospitality.   We had a great time in Stockholm but especially in Södermalm.
299154,80195169,2016-06-16T00:00:00.000Z,Nice experience in the heart of Stockholm. Was a small place but great for an overnight. And Daniel was extremely accommodating!
700113,346105426,2018-11-07T00:00:00.000Z,"The place is clean and has everything once can possibly need - an iron, a hair dryer, everything for cooking including olive oil which was really nice! It is also very quiet and has a big balcony."
164448,105266034,2016-10-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia is very nice,she was waiting us in the outside door when we arrived, then show me the map and told me about the transportation, sight viewing detailedly, the room is exactly same with the discreption, it is nice, just like home ,very convenient to ervey where, the ICA supermarket is near the apartment . Highly recommended to my friends."
608672,75134834,2016-05-19T00:00:00.000Z,"The flat is centrally located, walking distance or two short stops by train. Karl's wife greeted us and showed us the room. She also bought my girlfriend flowers for her birthday. Overall great experience, only the bathroom needs fixing as it is stated in other reviews."
954832,530806637,2019-09-16T00:00:00.000Z,This place was perfect for us close to everything and easy to get around. The apartment was set up great and there was nothing that you could have possibly needed. Mikael was also so nice to us and even let me use his washer in his apartment next door.
1189469,508196727,2019-08-12T00:00:00.000Z,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1182616,9194225,2013-12-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Being Airbnb host ourselves, we usually look for places to stay for a similar budget price as we ask. In Stockholm centre you will quickly end up at Peter's place. Though breakfast is not included, some basic things made available for general use like sugar, margarine, marmalade etc. for travellers staying for one or two days only, would be convenient. We also did miss a coffee machine, a complementary map of Stockholm, some brochures of tourist spots and some hints to use the public transport system.
The location is good, but walking to all top attractions requires well trained legs. 
Though we haven't seen Peter hardly, he seemed to us a most friendly guy. Travellers who appreciate privacy, should realize that the facilities must be shared with occupants of the two other Airbnb rooms, but if you wish to visit Stockholm and have a bed for an affordable price, sure Peter's place is recommendable."
581243,61388065,2016-02-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Very nice room in a big bright and very clean appartment. Bed is good, internet is fast, bathroom is just near the bedroom, and Edwin is very nice! He was very reactive to emails to give me all the information before my arrival, everything went well. 20 min walking to city center / metro station is in front of the building and only 2 stations away from central station, supermarket is downstairs, there is an elevator  in the building, and neighborhood is nice and quiet. Very good stay!"
757320,183353996,2017-08-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Siamo stati da Barb per 4 notti, l'appartamento si trova in un'ottima posizione per raggiungere il centro sia a piedi che coi mezzi. Cucina ben organizzata e attrezzata. Barb è stata inoltre molto gentile e flessibile per gli orari di check-in e check-out."
954832,321746268,2018-09-11T00:00:00.000Z,Mikael was a superb host! He sent us all the check-in information and even restaurant recommendations before our stay; he met us when we arrived and provided maps and helped us get our bearings; and the apartment was clean and in a great location. We were traveling with our 1 1/2 year-old toddler and he went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable. Highly recommend!
916806,20032788,2014-09-22T00:00:00.000Z,"The listing description is accurate. The surrounding is  very nice.  10 minutes  by foot to the metro station and 15 minutes by metro to the center of the city.  
Mansour answered my e-mails very quickly.  
We had self check in and self check out. No issues  with that."
1124388,45938256,2015-09-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Lovely place in Stockholm, small, but enough for us 3. The appartment is around 15 min from CentralStation, in a nice island. Carl was quite responsive over the email, he was travelling when we get there, but he made all the arrangements to facilitate our arrival."
628555,69216086,2016-04-10T00:00:00.000Z,Anna's apartment was very comfortable and quaint. She communicated effectively and gave us recommendations for local spots! I would definitely stay again!
1170766,347921061,2018-11-12T00:00:00.000Z,"I would definitely book again the apartment, it was really lovely and cozy, 10mins away from the city center and Annika gave us some good tip to make the walk more pleasant, through a local park.
The place looks much better than the pictures."
283446,85132842,2016-07-10T00:00:00.000Z,"welcomed by a hug,I feel very warm. It is a big, clean room, the environment is very good, although it is a bit far from downtown, but subway station and the supermarket is on the side of the apartment, the traffic is very convenient. Thank the host for pizza and sandwiches, very delicious! Thanks for the gift! It is a very unforgettable accommodation, I am glad to recommend!"
944703,157651607,2017-06-04T00:00:00.000Z,"My stay at Christina's place was one of the best Airbnb experiences thusfar! Great location, just 1 min walk away from the subway that takes you to the city in the blink of an eye. There!/ a beautiful lake nearby that offers an amazing view. I loved it:-)"
581243,30007862,2015-04-15T00:00:00.000Z,"The best way to let my fellow Airb&brs know of my experience with Edwin is to say:  I'll be back.  

This was my first experience with Airb&b and it was excellent.  VERY EASY.  Edwin and his wife are VERY clean.  The bed is EXCELLENT.  Absolutely no problems.

My highest recommendation.  Value for money is EXCELLENT!  (How will hotels survive AirB&B?)"
1271843,367667409,2019-01-05T00:00:00.000Z,"A great trendy apartment with the most comfortable bed- we can’t believe how well we slept. 
Communication was easy and Andre was very proactive in trying to assist us in maximising our stay.
The apartment is very clean and very stylish. 
The lift to access the apartment was a novelty and we recommend."
1096827,173785673,2017-07-24T00:00:00.000Z,It is a great comfortable flat which makes you feel like home at once in a very quiet residential district close to the subway station.we warmly recommend it to Stockholm visitors☺
536691,6685289,2013-08-21T00:00:00.000Z,Appartement très agréable est bien situé ( 2 minutes du métro). Seul petit bémol : très peu de vaisselle à dispo...
916806,71604080,2016-04-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Le logement était propre et conforme aux photos.
Le quartier est calme et vous trouverez pleins d'air de jeux pour les enfants.
Nous avons été accueilli par Julia qui est une personne très sympa.
Nous avons profité de leurs bons plans. Nous sommes tombés le samedi de l'année où plusieurs musés sont gratuits à Stockholm de 18h à minuit (merci Julia pour cette information!).
Pour tout nos mails ou messages envoyés, nous avons reçu une réponse rapide. 
Merci à vous deux."

514210,36963495,2015-07-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Margareta's apartment is absolutely wonderful! The location is safe and beautiful, although a bit far from Stockholm center and Old Town. Margareta is a thoughtful and kind host, willing to help us with whatever we needed. The room was nice, large, and clean, and it had a balcony overlooking the small, picturesque road leading to the house. Overall, it was an amazing experience. I would really recommend Margareta's place and would absolutely stay there again the next time I visit Stockholm."
1117037,272773303,2018-06-04T00:00:00.000Z,For a trip to Stockholm a quite good possibility to stay.
1182616,285187407,2018-07-03T00:00:00.000Z,"This is a nice place, easy to get to-and  from Arlanda, and not too far away from the inner city. The appartment could have been a little bit cleaner, and with so many guest at the same time, it was some waiting for using the  bathroom/shower/toilett.  The balcony was a nice place for breakfast!The host didnt live there but was easy to get to if needed☺"
299154,29565590,2015-04-09T00:00:00.000Z,Daniel was an excellent and accommodating host. The apartment is brilliantly located and perfect for access to the entire Stockholm - which can be done on foot from there. The apartment has everything that you need and is well appointed.
1248490,22241080,2014-11-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Maria's huis was perfect voor onze stedentrip met een groep van 6 vrienden. We hebben Maria zelf niet ontmoet, maar alles was goed geregeld en de communicatie was zeer goed. Bedankt Maria!"
688947,186405920,2017-08-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Alexandre was a wonderful host. Very hospitable and a pleasure to talk with. Alexander's place was away from the centre, though very close to the metro which was only 20 or so minutes from the centre. He also lives in a welcoming neighbourhood full of warm, lovely people  :)"
1212891,12219212,2014-04-26T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a great time at Mauds place. She is happy to help with any problem or question you come with and makes you feel at home rightaway…you have a lot of privacy (eventhough the cats like to break this rule, when you leave the door open!;) in this very clean and cosy place. We really recommend this place to stay and enjoy Stockholm! :)"
1158893,186949861,2017-08-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Super  location, hôtes extras , très bien organisés et plein de bons conseils.
La maison est vraiment très agréable et parfaite pour un groupe de 8.
Marche de 15-20mn pour aller jusqu'au métro. Un bus fait le trajet mais il ne fonctionne plus à partir de 18h30...à savoir si on est chargé.
Nous avons vraiment passé un excellent séjour !"
1048668,4554827,2013-05-12T00:00:00.000Z,"My friend and I stayed in Melissa’s beautiful apartment during our weekend in Stockholm. Melissa was a very kind host. She welcomed us at the apartment, was very helpful, gave us tips for Stockholm and even prepared breakfast at our arrival day. The apartment was equipped with everything we needed; it is well-located and close to a subway station and supermarket. There is also a bus stop in front of the apartment. Nice balcony to enjoy the sun and to relax after a day in the city."
763407,11348295,2014-03-31T00:00:00.000Z,"We (couple with 2 boys aged 4 and 7) had a brilliant stay in Gabriella's apartment. Her place is very clean, tidy, has a homely atmosphere and is very centrally located. We appreciated the comfortable beds and bedding and nice large bath towels. Also she communicates very well with guests and goes out of her way to ensure the check-in and check-out goes smoothly. This was our first airbnb experience, and it was great! Will definitely enquire again next time we come to Stockholm."

838442,473754401,2019-06-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Eine sehr zentral gelegene Wohnung- die Altstadt ist ebenso fussläufig erreichbar wie der Hauptbahnhof (und via Alanda Express damit auch der Airport).
Wohnung hat individuellen Charme, da im Innenhof des Gebäudes gelegen, wo ein Restaurant betrieben wird- so hat man quasi vor der Haustür eine nette Kneipe (Laustärke war kein Problem).
Die Doppelstockbetten waren etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig, aber ok.
Hat Spass gemacht!"
1244657,188375424,2017-08-29T00:00:00.000Z,A great place next to the old town. Quiet location. Friendly and helpful hosts. I enjoyed my stay.

Die Lage war perfekt, U-Bahn und Busstation keine 5 Minuten entfernt. Viele nette Restaurants und Cafés in der Gegend. Unsere Gastgeber waren unglaublich nett, hilfsbereit und flexibel. Ich würde jederzeit wieder diese Wohnung buchen."

She is very kind and she really takes time to give some tips.
The purple room is a lovely and cozy room. The tramway is  also very closed.
We were in Stockholm for only one night but for a longer trip, we will come back to her place for sure !"
873383,312841754,2018-08-24T00:00:00.000Z,"I liked staying in Isabelle's colorful and cozy apartment. Although the apartment is not located in the very city of Stockholm, the public transport connections are really excellent. In addition, the quiet area of the apartment is ideal for those wishing to escape the noisy and lively city center while staying close to it. Isabelle was a very helpful host. The two pretty cats are a big plus too :-)"

The location is great. The neighbourhood is lively and the apartment is close to the Hornstull T-Bana station and the bus stop where you can take the airport bus.

The apartment itself is decorated both aesthetically and functionally. We felt quite at home. I'd definitely recommend this place."

Viveka was away but she was available to answer to our questions and to give us some tips. She is very attentive.
It was a great experience !"

Her instructions of how to get to/in her building didn't get to me the first time around so I had some troubles finding her initially. Her apartment is very clean, quiet and comfortable. If you want a quiet stay with little interaction from your host then you should book here. If you want a bit more going on, then maybe look into something else. I do wish she allowed me use of her kitchen (even just to store perishables and not cook) or laundry (ONE laundromat in all of Stockholm)."
1124388,150546566,2017-05-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Unser Aufenthalt bei Carl war super! Er war total entspannt, hilfsbereit und bemühte sich wirklich sehr, ein guter Gastgeber zu sein. Carl schickte uns schon im Vorfeld ein paar Infos zu der Lage seiner Wohnung, half uns dann am Anreisetag die richtige Buslinie (+Haltestelle) zu finden und holte uns sogar von der Haltestelle ab!

Было очень тепло. Удобная мягкая кровать. Бесплатная парковка рядом с домом, что для Швеции большая редкость. Чистый воздух и живописный вид. Мы приехали поздно ночью, поэтому использовали self check-in. Юлия очень подробно расписала в сообщениях что и как делать. Когда у нас возникали вопросы или нужен был совет насчет достопримечательностей, Юлия оперативно(2-3 минуты) отвечала на сообщения и даже созванивались. В пешей доступности от жилья много супермаркетов с огромным выбором и адекватными ценами. Мы получили незабываемые впечатления от отдыха. Юлия, спасибо за гостеприимство!"

206221,194281231,2017-09-16T00:00:00.000Z,"I booked accommodation for my mother and her friend with Elisabeth. While I can confidently say that they had an amazing time staying with Elisabeth, this review is from them...

Elisabeth greeted us with a huge smile and lots of energy. She continued to be a happy and fun host for the duration of our week-long stay. The breakfast each morning was fabulous and if we behaved ourselves we were treated with a chocolate =). 

The location was perfect. Right in the middle of Sodermalm, yet down a quiet and very safe feeling street. The train station was only a short walk through the heart of the city.

The room was spacious and comfortable with towels and linen provided.

Thank you very much Elisabeth for making us feel so welcome in your home and city. You made our experience much more fun than staying elsewhere. 

Be sure to comment on the light shade in the kitchen during your stay with Elisabeth and watch her face light up!

We can not recommend Elisabeth and her AirBnB highly enough.

Many thanks,
Linda and Sue"
1153177,511423356,2019-08-17T00:00:00.000Z,Terry is a great host. He is thoughtful and patient. He even gave us a big surprise. His apartment is big and clean. It’s convenient for four girls to stay and cook. It’s near the metro. And just two stations to T-central. We really spend a great time in Terry’s apartment.
347192,121653812,2016-12-18T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment did not answer our expectations at all. We had expected something cleaner.

819676,85402072,2016-07-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Andy and Vannie were beyond welcoming. From letting me check in super early after my train arrived at ~6am to letting me store my luggage on my last day while I squeezed in my last few hours of sightseeing, helpful suggestions on what to see and foods to eat, to movie nights and making me truly feel at home. The apartment itself is beautiful, renovated, and in a perfect location. I walked everywhere, around Södermalm, Gamla Stan, to Djurgarden. If I'm ever in Stockholm I know where I am staying. Highly recommend!! Thanks again Andy and Vannie!"

954832,340589093,2018-10-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Mikael was an outstanding host! The unit is small but immaculately clean, quiet, near shopping, restaurants, and transit -- perfect for one couple.

Staying with Anitta made the big city of Stockholm feel manageable.  Thank you,  Anitta!"
954832,9608293,2014-01-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Me and my family stayed at Mikaels apartment over the new year. And it was all great, Mikael was a great host, helped us with a lot of information about the city, sigths and shopping.

All the amenities needed. Whilst I only spoke to lovely Edwin once upon my arrival as I was staying briefly for work, his instructions were detailed and he was very accommodating with my late arrival.

Location is excellent near transport connection, I would definitely recommend as the perfect base for exploring Stockholm!"
1128990,7304778,2013-09-15T00:00:00.000Z,An apartment could not be located more conveniently in relation to where we needed to be in Stockholm! It was literally right up the road. The communication with Anette went smoothly at all times. Thanks for allowing us in! :)

916806,87171676,2016-07-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Mansour hat alles dafür getan, um sich in seinem Appartement wohl zu fühlen. Die Beschreibung der Unterkunft passte zu dem, was wir vorgefunden haben und ist für einen Aufenthalt mit zwi, max. drei Personen perfekt. Es gab eine sehr gute Wegbeschreibung für die Ankunft am Flughafen zur Unterkunft. Die Fahrzeiten mit der U Bahn passten genau, allerdings möchte man die Entfernungen am Tag vielleicht nicht zweimal zurücklegen, insbesondere von Skärholmen zur Unterkunft. Die Unterkunft ist sehr ruhig im Grünen gelegen, zum See mit Bademöglichkeit sind es zu Fuß ca. 20 Minuten."

Despite the fact that our arriving flight  was delayed by five hours the host made sure that the key exchange was easy and efficient. The apartment is located in a great location for a first time visitor to Stockholm who wants to be based in the medieval city. We found that we could walk to most of the tourist sites. The apartment is clean and functional. On our day of departure we were able to walk to the Central Train Station in less than 15 minutes. We will highly recommend this ideally located apartment to our family and friends.

I had a late flight back to London and Karl kindly allowed me to leave his flat at the time that was mostly convenient to me. The apartment is extremely central, 5-10 minute walk from the train station, loads of shops, restaurants and coffee shops just round the corner from the apartment. Would really recommend Karl's apartment for anyone who wants to stay in the heart of Stockholm. Karl made me feel very welcomed."

944703,496305066,2019-07-27T00:00:00.000Z,"As a welcome, Frida made us a blueberry pie and left us some ice cream, eggs and juice in the fridge, which was very nice (and tasty). Check-in was easy. The communication with both Frida and Christina was fast, helpful and uncomplicated.
Christinas apartment is very clean and bright, with all basic equipment you need. Although there is a construction area near the house right now, it was totally fine since we spent most of our days in the city. Generally, it was mostly silent at nights, even though
the apartment is close to a metro station (3 min walk). With the metro (at up to 10 min. intervals) you get to Stockholm city center in 15-20 min. The next supermarket we found was about 8 min away (walking distance), which was totally fine.
We really enjoyed our stay and recommend staying at Christina's place."

274876,3252180,2013-01-03T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed at Emma's apartment with 5 adults for the New Year's celebration. The initial contact with Emma by email and sms was very easy and friendly. All necessary information (how to get there, whether we need to take towels etc) were given and we were looking forward to the trip.

When we met Emma she was very friendly and easy going. She showed us the great apartment and left a little note with tips about restaurants, shops and how to reach her in the case of an emergency. 

The flat itself was great. Enough space for five adults to sleep, eat (even a big New Year dinner), lounge on the sofa and read lots of newspapers. There was one room with a big double bed, another one with a king size bed and a third room with two single bed. So if necessary a 6th person can easily find space. 
The open kitchen has a big table, great for meals or board game nights in and the adjoined living room has a comfy sofa and armchairs. 
The flat was equipped very well. There was everything you could wish for (towels, bedlinen, crockery, cutlery, kitchen appliances, wifi, ipod adapter for big speakers etc) and we really enjoyed staying in the apartment. There was a small balcony overlooking the yard and the stylish yet comfortable design and interior of the flat made us feel at home very soon. 

The location is great. It's in the middle of Södermalm and you can easily walk to Götgatan/Folkungagatan/Medborgaplatsen and/or Slussen station (to head into town or take the ferry to Skeppsholmen or Djurgarden). It's a great way to enjoy the little shops and cafés along the way. But it's also possible to take the 53, 2 or 66 bus towards Slussen or directly into town. It takes only 15 mins max. There is also a night bus. 
The nearest supermarket is only 2 minutes away and there are many restaurants around. 

We really enjoyed staying in Emmas apartment and can recommend it to everyone. There was nothing missing and even though we only met her briefly we always had the feeling that we could feel at home and could take things from the cupboards, should we have forgotten to buy anything for our meals. 
We will be back!"

Man fühlt sich gleich wohl. Dass man in Leinenbettwäsche schlafen kann, es ein niedliches kleines Aquarium in einem der Zimmer und z.B. gleich ums Eck ein entzückendes Café gibt, an dem auch Veganer ihre Freude haben, sind nur ein paar der weiteren Pluspunkte. Man kann ohne Weiteres die Altstadt und alle interessanten Viertel zu Fuß erreichen. Die U-Bahn ist auch nur wenige Fußminuten entfernt. 
Gabriella ist ein wunderbare Gastgeberin, sie hat uns schon im Voraus hervorragende Tipps zu Restaurants, Cafés und Bars gegeben, die Kommunikation war durchgehend sehr angenehm.

They were very accommodating to our wishes. We enjoyed lovely dinners with them and they were open to share the experience with us and our guests.

If you want friendly hosts who see you as more than a paying guest, but rather as someone with whom to share joy, this is the place to stay. At the same time, they assured us that if we had wanted the place entirely to ourselves, they would have arranged that too."

We didn't meet Cecilia, but she made it easy by leaving a key with the restaurant within the building. 

The closest subway station was about a 5 minute walk, and if you're hungry late at night, there's a \"Gatukok\" right outside. 

Lovely place, and much bigger than the pictures show."

The place was clean, and the kitchen was thoughtfully stocked with city maps, transit maps, maps of gay nightlife and museums. The room was comfortable, and the nice balcony shown in the ad was a relief in surprisingly hot weather. The apartment is a block away from a pick-up/drop-off point in new, inexpensive shuttle bus service to the airport, and in an easily reached part of town."
1182616,64328771,2016-03-02T00:00:00.000Z,Really good at communicating and answering promptly. Although we never got to meet Peter he was very accommodating and it was super easy getting around in the city from his apartment. Thumbs up for the tempur-pedic mattress and the sunny balcony :) There were however quite a few other people staying in the apartment at the same time which could make things a bit awkward. But if you're the social comfortable type it's no problem at all.

His place is also in a central location and walking distance to the great areas/places in Stockholm - like ferries to the islands, Gamla Stan, the Vasa Museum, the gardens, shopping, terrific restaurants, grocery stores and Saluhall, trains, subway, etc. We cannot say enough to good things about Terry or the apartment.

The apartment is centrally located close to the St. Eriksplan metro stop and a twenty minute walk from Central train station.  Shopping for food is easy as grocery stores are only a couple of minutes' walk away.  Many good restaurants are located on the same street close by.
We were very pleased with our choice of apartment and would gladly rent it again.  It was an ideal location for us to visit Stockholm, a very beautiful city, particularly in the summer."

Her father was very sweet and called us a cab for the airport which was also very helpful. I would definitely recommend staying at Diana's, very comfortable and perfect for four friends staying in Stockholm. The train is super easy to get to and it's a safe neighborhood. 15 minutes by train to get to center Stockholm, worth getting a pass if you're staying for the week. Overall, great city, great trip."

1182616,413235572,2019-02-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Peter was very kind and helpful. The accommodation was also great, in a  good location. I could mention only one strange thing: we didn't expect more guests to come to the apartment outside of us. We thought just Peter (and his family maybe) will be there and us.  I didn't see any information about \"more airbnb guest\"  while  booking. (Maybe my attention has been avoided. In that case I'm sorry). Otherwise, this was not an issue."

Idéalement situé: 3 mn à pied du métro et à 3 stations de la vieille ville, très calme, petit supermarché à proximité. L'appartement est vaste, très clair et agréable.
Nous avons été accueilli très chaleureusement par Terry qui nous avait préparé un bon diner que nous avons partagé ensemble en discutant et nous avons pu profiter de ses conseils.
Merci encore Terry, nous avons passé une excellente semaine.

E' composto da una camera luminosa e arredata con gusto, bagno e una piccola cucina per pasti veloci; perfetto per una persona o per una coppia. 
Abbiamo trascorso una piacevole vacanza a Stoccolma anche grazie all'ottima sistemazione e alla gentilezza dell'ospite. Karl è infatti una persona molto cordiale e disponibile, sempre pronta a darci consigli per visite alla città e \"gite fuori porta\" e ad aiutare in caso di necessità (ho avuto bisogno di consultare un medico per un piccolo incidente e Karl mi ha indicato come procedere e a chi rivolgermi). 
Una sistemazione che consiglio a chiunque sia alla ricerca di un alloggio comodo e confortevole per soggiornare nella splendida Stoccolma."
1265989,33136014,2015-05-25T00:00:00.000Z,Our host was great from beginning to the end of our stay.  They were very accommodating and also provided with great information.  When we arrive they gave us a tour of the house and explained everything that we needed to know which helped our stay go very smoothly.  We enjoyed our stay tremendously and enjoyed the house very much.  Very flexible and accommodating during check in and check out.
1212891,31421642,2015-05-05T00:00:00.000Z,"We loved to rest on the cosy bed in the room after exhausing all-day walk in the city. The room has everything you need and Maud even thinks about small (but valuable!) things such as water,  pen and notebook, city guidebook and a map. Also, she holds a pile of brochures so you can definitely find new ideas on how to spend your time. 
The apartment is located not far from the metro line heading to the center and from the supermarket. And Maud gives perfect instruction on how to find it. 
Would definitely recommend to stay with Maud, especially if you are travelling on a budget."

The neighborhood was very nice! You could reach the commuter trains within two minutes, the subway in, I guess, 5 to 10 minutes and the lake in 15 minutes.
Karin was always friendly, reachable and helpful!
We enjoyed our stay at Karin's flat and we recommend it for a visit in Stockholm!"

Perfect wifi of course, and nice view from the window"

She is very very helpful and helps you organising your stay. She can tell you about sweden and its capital. Me and my friend would always come back to her flat! The location of the appartment is especially for young people very interesting. The bohemean and student area are very close by. The room is not too big but there is enough space for a few days. There is a good security in the house and an elevator. The bathroom is not the youngest but very clean. She offers breakfast if you want to. Just enjoy the stay in her accomodation and the city! Thank you Lidia.

I chose Dany's house for our staying in Stockholm (3 nights) and it was the best decision of the entire trip. The house is amazing; all of us loved the space, especially the backyard and the living rooms. The bedrooms are amazing and the master bedroom's bed is like sleeping in heaven. The house is simply gorgeous and luxurious. The house has everything you need for a comfortable staying and makes your life easier when staying in a house that has everything at your disposal.
I would like to leave here a special thank you to Dany, who thought about all the small details to make our staying very pleasant. In addition, he helped me with everything, providing me with all kind of information useful for my first visit to Stockholm. 
I do not have enough words to thank him for everything. Great house and even greater host. We love this house and definitely recommended 100%. 
Thank you so very much Dany :D 
All the best wishes,

Anitta welcomed me (after I showed up an hour late due to getting myself lost) warmly, and was pleasant and extremely helpful with all things around the house and Stockholm in general. Her cozy home was very clean and inviting. The bedroom might be the quietest bedroom I've slept in in my time on AirBnB. The neighborhood itself is quiet and easily navigable, a 10 minute walk to the train station with a few bus routes in between. Anitta was very polite and always made sure I had everything I needed. She made sure I had breakfast at the time I requested, and never disappointed. It was a welcoming, cozy, and very relaxing refuge away from busy Stockholm's city center. I would definitely book with Anitta again. Tusen tack för allt!"

The location to shops, Metro and being in a hip neighborhood are just a plus, their home is really a home away from home and I will recommend them to my friends! Love my bed (slept well all the time!) and love the shower and toilet! Minimalist design!"
347192,78230453,2016-06-05T00:00:00.000Z,Matilda is a great communicator and very helpful host. My late arrival was no problem for her as she arranged keys to be ameasily accessible when I got there. The apartment is on a quiet street very close to all the fun sodermalm activities.  The place could have used a proper hoovering before our arrival but that did not bother us too much.
819676,199075471,2017-10-01T00:00:00.000Z,The location is excellent. It was so easy to walk and see the sights. Stockholm is a very interesting city with a cosmopolitan flare.

The apartment itself was very clean and cosy - and the balcony is just amazing :) The perfect place to spend some days in Stockholm. Although not located directly in the city center, it’s situated ideal - public library is 5min walking distance away as well as many sweet little cafes and others. Highly recommended :)"

755843,185894788,2017-08-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Location: This is an apartment located about a 20min walk from the central train station. Nearby are supermarkets (a corner store is across the street, too), drugstore, liquor store and restaurants. Although Stockholm can be difficult to see on foot sometimes because of the water barriers we found most places to be within an hour of the apartment and if you're crazy like us you can even walk to Drottningholm Palace to get a sense of the suburbs and take the boat back.

Communication: Upon our arrival in the city, Pär responded quickly on the AirBnB app and was there when we got to the apartment. 

The Residence: If you are an school AirBnB person like us who prefers staying at places that are actually lived in rather than just rented out as income, this a good choice, with his extensive book collection showing his love for travel and mystery novels. He made space for us in his fridge and utensils were available for cooking if we wanted. 

Overall: We were very happy with our stay and would definitely come again."

1263992,5828820,2013-07-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Scott har en dejlig funktionel lejlighed beliggende på øen Lille Essinge ca. 15 min kørsel i bus fra Stockholm centrum. 

Alt fungerer fint med køkken, bad, vaskemaskine og tørretumbler, opholdsstue og terrasse. Der er elevator og mulighed for at leje Scotts parkeringsplads under lejlighedskomplekset - anbefales, hvis Scott ikke selv bruger den, da der kun er offentlig betalingsparkering udenfor bygningen. Vi var 2 voksne og vores datter på 15 år, der boede i lejligheden i 7 dage - henover weekenden kom vores søn og hans kæreste og overnattede 2 nætter - de puslede lidt rundt med hynderne til de 2 sofaer i stuen, så de kunne ligge ved siden af hinanden :-) den ene på hynderne på gulvet og den anden på en sofa. Lejligheden er på 5. sal og placeret sådan, at den direkte udsigt er til andre lejligheder i bygningen overfor - skråt til venstre ses lidt vandmiljø. Omkring ved 17-18-tiden kommer solen forbi lejligheden i et par timer, ellers ligger den i skygge.

Scott havde meget betænksomt købt et buskort til os, så der var penge nok til, at vi kunne komme til centrum, hvorefter vi selv kunne fylde kortet op med yderligere kørepenge. Det koster 25 kr. pr. person at køre/sejle med SL-selskabet overalt i 75 min. inkl. bus/bådskift.

Vi havde en fantastisk dejlig ferie i Stockholm med skønne oplevelser byen, i omegnen og i skærgården - det kan helt klart anbefales at sejle en tur ud i skærgården og besøge en af de skønne øer. Vi havde pragtfuldt vejr med varme og høj sol, da vi var der - det forskønner jo enhver oplevelse :-)

Det er første gang Scott udlejer sin lejlighed, og med et par fif til ham om nogle opmærksomhedspunkter, vil jeg helt klart anbefale at leje denne lejlighed."
299154,366190912,2019-01-02T00:00:00.000Z,Daniel was a great host and was super accommodating. He made check in and check out super easy. He also is very helpful and quick with responding. The apartment is in a good location as well.

The place was also very nice, by the riverside, with a beautiful view for some pics and a nearby cafe perfect for a sunset drink. Loved the experience!  What an amazing way to end the day,  enjoy a different perspective of the city and create a good memory."
1234109,42888748,2015-08-16T00:00:00.000Z,Comfortable and spacious flat. The area was peaceful with a park opposite and the waterside nearby.  Shops and metro/buses just around the corner.Host  gave us helpful advice and responded quickly. Loved staying there. Thanks Natalie!

Host 人很客氣,早餐很豐盛,房子很乾淨,旁邊還有超市｡住所距離tram stop 2分鐘,很近,但是離市中心有20分鐘｡有一件事要注意,host 有一個年邁的媽媽,所以要保持安靜｡"

1212891,19204333,2014-09-08T00:00:00.000Z,"My fiancé and I deeply enjoyed our stay at Maud's home. The place was very easy to get to from the central station, and is located in a beautiful area. There is a huge market nearby, making it easy and delightful to have frequent picnics by the waterfront. The walk from her place to the city center along the waters is really nice as well. As for the actual room, it was spotlessly clean! I was very impressed and believe that it is even nicer than in the pictures. Her place was very well organized and cozy! Also, Maud was super sweet and welcoming. We would recommend anyone to visit stockholm (loved it) and stay here!"

There is ample space for two people, everything is clean, and Mikael has very thoughtfully stocked his place with helpful items for travelers, such as umbrellas, coffee, maps, and an adapter."

Maud is a very friendly, helpful and open person. She is really concerned about you feeling comfortable in the flat. Living together with her has always been easygoing."
1182616,6989053,2013-09-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Peter is an Airbnb host pro! Although he wasn't in town the weekend that we arrived in Stockholm, he did more than enough to ensure that we had a perfectly smooth check-in with very clear instructions via multiple channels of communication. The room was a decent size for two friends, and the balcony was very charming. The apartment was a hop away from the metro station, which was another added benefit, with a couple bars and plenty of convenience stores around. 

Although we didn't make use of the kitchen, it seemed like it was clean and accessible, too."
916806,13602797,2014-06-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Netter, vor allem auch zuverlässiger Gastgeber.  Appartement liegt zwar 20 Bahnminuten außerhalb, aber der Blick auf die Schären macht das wieder wett. Sauber, gut ausgestattet und große Terrasse für lange Sommersonnenabende. Wer nicht nur die City sucht, ist hier bestens aufgehoben"
873383,91133763,2016-08-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Hi firstly, I should attend to express my apologizes to Isabelle for my late arrival the first night.Because after we arrive the airport,we are looking for the place saling Stockholm card in airport and waiting for buses to metro.We thought the card could include metro but actually it is not.We continued to search where we can buy metro card,it waste a lot of time for we have no cash but credit card.So when we arrive Isabella home,it is late she had already fallen asleep.We would like all the hosts inNorth Europe to know,for our Chinese,the expense in your country is so expensive for us,even we had a not bad salary inChina,especially for transportation and foods,so we must make calculations and comprision,choose a economic route to save money so that we can have more time and chance to look around your country while it would waste much time at first.That might be called culture (Website hidden by Airbnb) I extend my apologies to Isabella to postpone her time and I will grasp my time and give proper time to the host.Please understand us too.Thank you!Isabelle home is in the south area of Stockholm,about ten minutes metro time to the central area.It is convinient.She is patient and would like answer all my questions.Thank her host in Stockholm and wish her a good life!"

822497,12750970,2014-05-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Apartment was a excellent choice for  family of four stay in Stockholm.  Convenient location to the subway into town about 15 minutes.  Also street parking was available even at late evening hours.
Our host Moa was very accommodating. Our flight was delayed and we arrived late in the evening. Moa was happily waiting for us and gave us a quick lay of the land and a few tips before leaving us for the night. She was also so kind to have a couple of items stocked in the kitchen (even a little Swedish chocolate!!! This was a first for us and we are frequent airbnb/ (Hidden by Airbnb) users) for the tired travelers that we were.  It was great to not have to search for breakfast(especially) on our first morning. Thanks Moa!"
608672,102102085,2016-09-16T00:00:00.000Z,My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Karl met us personally and gave us a tour of our room as well as well as discussed the city.  He let us know how to contact him should we need anything. Great location to shopping and fabulous restaurants.
533880,11350623,2014-03-31T00:00:00.000Z,"We spent a sunny weekend in Stockholm and Jarl's room was the perfect home base. It's very close to the Stadion metro station, or if you like walking you can get there from the central area through the beautiful Ostermalmen neighbourhood in about half an hour. Jarl is easy to reach and quick to respond to emails. He was very flexible about check-in and check-out times."
647314,8936074,2013-11-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Even if we didn't meet Mallika our three-day-stay in Stockholm was great! The flat is beautiful, it was so homelike and cozy, and very clean. Our bedroom was huge and the bed very big and comfortable!! The area of Södermalm is really cool, you find some nice bars and shops around here.
Her two cats Shadow and Ramses are friendly, a little bit shy, but very sweet, when they started to confide in us. 
We can absolutely recommend to stay in Mallikas flat, it's much better than every other standard accommodation."
795354,17070707,2014-08-06T00:00:00.000Z,"My stay at Gustavs was great. He was kind enough to pick me up from the airport when I landed and was very easy to reach my entire stay at his apartment when I needed anything. The apartment is just as pictured, clean, spacious, comfortable. The area is ideal, plenty to do and find within walking distance. I highly recommend staying here."
757320,28892268,2015-03-31T00:00:00.000Z,"The appartment is just perfect for Stockholm. It is located in the nice and trendy neighbourhood of Södermalm, just next to the metro station. Nice restaurants and bars, coffeehouses etc are within walking distance. Also the old city center is really close by.
The room itself was lovely and the bed is really comfortable. The shared bathroom was really clean and tidy. 
Barb is a lovely and attentive host. She had made sure that everything we need for a nice weekend away was there."
1234960,74421578,2016-05-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Our stay at Jacob's house was just perfect!
The house is located only 5 minutes away from the metro station and a grocery store, 15 minutes away by metro from the city centre, making it very convenient to be close to everything but also enjoy some relax away from the city. 
Jacob was very welcoming and picked us up at the metro station, gave us some tips of what to do in Stockholm and made some coffee and bought us some bread and pastry, which was very kind of him.
House is just great, huge spaces, comfortable beds and sofas and even a Sauna!! Did not try it, so I'll have to go back for that ;-) The best is the garden, ideal to have a nice coffee on a sunny morning.
Definitely recommended!!!!"
854975,5800285,2013-07-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Sergej is a great host! It was our first time using Airbnb and we had an amazing time. Sergej had also provided us with a list of things to see and do in stockholm which was great and helped us out. He was also there to answer any questions we had during our stay. 

Apartment was clean, comfortable and only a short walk to the city or transport. As per the description it would fit 2 people comfortably (we had 3 and it was still fine).

Most importantly, Sergej accepted us on extremely late notice (we contacted him a few hours before we were due to arrive)

I'd recommend this apartment to anyone =)"
862868,56417394,2015-12-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice and cozy appartment right in the center of town. If you like walking, quite everything is within walking distance! We actually never used the public transport, exept to and from the airport.

Supermarkets and several restaurants within 3 minutes.
Arriving very late on a saturday evening we appreciated very much that next-morning's breakfast had been made available in the fridge.

René and Wilma."
278311,65726809,2016-03-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice young family with cute baby!  The house is situated away from the city as the listing says, but it is quite easy to go back and forth from the city, takes literally 30mins including the walk from metro/train. Linnéa lent me the spare transport card so i could top up with the 24 hours pass and that was convenient.

The walk up is easy but if you are arriving with a big luggage like me in winter time, be prepared for some pushing and rolling.

I didnt see much of Linnéa as she was away with baby, but her bf Arnando took good care of me and even bought breakfast items for me. They even recommended coffee spots for me as i am a coffee hunter, and all the suggestions were great!

House and room is big and surely enough space for two people. The trail literally behind the house around the lake is amazing and so is the nature area on the other side of the lake. Went for a nice walk and took me half an hour to get to the other side."
565912,6289351,2013-08-06T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed in summer 2013 with our family in this beautiful house and really enjoyed it very much! The house is very comfortable and beautifully and romantic decorated. The location is perfect for visits into Stockholm (10-15min by car) and into the neighborhood. Our three young kids felt very much at home in the house and we all found it a great experience into the Swedish way of llving to have the honour to stay for almost a week in this great place.

Also the hospitality of Patrik, the owner, was very warm and supportive. 

We very much recommend this great place to many other visitors who plan a visit to the great city of Stockholm!"
242188,172221482,2017-07-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Li's place is well worth a visit. The apartment is centrally located with a whole floor dedicated to the Air BnB guests. 

As a host, Li takes the time to make sure the guests have what they need and know where to go to get the most out of their stay in Stockholm. Apart from this she also is a nice and outgoing lady, which makes her a very pleasant host."
755843,175486760,2017-07-29T00:00:00.000Z,Great place. Short walk to main downtown and train and bus arrival. Huge bed. Cable tv. Nice guy. Sofa can sleep up to two.
819676,473676599,2019-06-22T00:00:00.000Z,"We couldn’t have asked for a better spot for our first trip to Stockholm. Everything was super easy to get to and the biggest bonus was the apartment is close to the train station so we didn’t have far to go with our luggage. 

Great spots nearby for beer, shopping, coffee and a great view of the midnight sunset on the waterfront - all a quick 5 mins walk from the front door. Andy was a great host, even offered some recommendations for us to watch the US women’s soccer match! Highly recommend if you’re just looking for a place to crash in between exploring."
164448,164071410,2017-06-26T00:00:00.000Z,One of the best stays we have had. Li was so helpful and very informative on everything Stockholm. She was extremely flexible and her house was very comfortable. Location was terrific too. Definitely recommend!
755843,281702433,2018-06-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Pär is a super host for a very good reason. Not only was the apartment great and exactly as represented in the listing but also he was very helpful on the check-in.  There are a couple of things that aren’t covered in the listing and the reviews which might be good to know. First off, there are some stairs because the apartment is on a “half floor.” Despite the fact that we both use canes, this was not a serious problem especially since Pär helped us in with the luggage. The other thing that was not in the listing was that the building has laundry facilities in the basement. Pär  thoughtfully booked us a time so that we could continue our journey with clean clothes!

We would totally recommend this booking for anyone wanting a nice quiet place to stay in Stockholm with good access to transportation to get just about anywhere you want in the city."
453692,1243543,2012-05-07T00:00:00.000Z,"We spent 4 nights in Lovisa's apartment which was ideal for our 'city break' in Stockholm. Contact with Lovisa was very easy. We needed to make a last minute booking as our original accommodation was cancelled and she replied immediately. She was very flexible about check in/check out as our flight arrived early but left late.
Lovisa's apartment really is light and has a nice view of the Tantolunden park. It's a few minutes from the T-bana and buses stop outside the door. There are nice walks around the shore in both directions with great views, especially to the north, and it was easy to reach Gamla Stan or foot either along the water or via Hornsgatan. 
There are shops for all basic needs and a state run alcohol outlet in the immediate vicinity. The kitchen is adequately equipped for the preparation of simple meals.
Our concerns about traffic noise were unfounded due to the sound insulation of triple glazing.  It may prove more of a problem in summer as this is a very cosy flat. Being old enough to be Lovisa's parents we were also concerned about noise from the bar when, on our first night, there was live music with the drum kit directly beneath the kitchen!  However, it stopped at around 10.30 and we were not disturbed any other night, including Friday & Saturday. In fact we slept well in a very comfortable bed.
Sodermalm is a great district to stay for a visit to Stockholm and Lovisa's apartment makes a good base which we can recommend."
1166419,49505802,2015-10-04T00:00:00.000Z,"It was very nice, good location."
442837,19041753,2014-09-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Joana's apartment was spacious, nicely illuminated, clean and comfortable. All the facilities are provided and the location is excellent. It is close to many shops and great transport connections too. Lots of places to eat and the shopping centre on your doorstep. No wireless in the flat - but you can get this at the McDonalds nearby.

Joana was accommodating and a flexible host. I was made to feel like I could come and go as I pleased and I think this was fine.
The room was good - had a good wardrobe, desk and comfortable bed. As much as I wanted. Kitchen was very  nice."
206221,6327102,2013-08-08T00:00:00.000Z,"We spent a wonderful time at Elisabeth's home. She is such a warmhearted woman and a very caring host. The room was comfortable and clean as well as the bathroom. Elisabeth prepared us a delicious breakfast every morning and gave us always the feeling to be welcome. The localisation of the appartment is perfect: Södermalm is very nice and a good place to start your tour through Stockholm, close to nature as well as to restaurants, cafés and the sights of Stockholm. If you want, Elisabeth gives advices what to see in Stockholm and what you could do during the stay.
We absolutely recommend you to stay there."
757320,31299991,2015-05-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Room was exactly as pictured. Barb was there to meet me, no difficulties locating the address, several attempts to get into the building but after the 3rd try I had it figured out.
Apartment is very close to the underground, only 3 stops to the old town. Did not walk around the local area as I only had 2 days.
If you are a light sleeper or like a dark room, bring an eye mask and ear plugs. The street noise can be a bit loud, nothing my eye mask and ear plugs couldn't fix and shouldn't stop you from staying."
259025,1088639,2012-04-06T00:00:00.000Z,"ali is a great host, his place was very comfy and spacious enough for the two of us! and a nice surprise to have breakfast! very accommodating with being able to use the kitchen. *****"

Kristina war eine sehr nette, hilfsbereite und offene Gastgeberin.
Sie gab mir Empfehlungen für Cafes, Ausflüge und Sehenswürdigkeiten.
Die Wohnung liegt sehr ruhig, ist sehr schön eingerichtet und sehr sauber.
Ich konnte alles benutzen und mich wie zuhause fühlen.
Eine Bushaltestelle liegt ganz nahe bei der Wohnung, man kann aber auch in die Innenstadt laufen."
242188,22177372,2014-11-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia was a great host. My stay of 3 months while doing a PhD stay at KTH University was great. Conveniently located in Södermalm, has a few grocery stores nearby, Södra station 1 min. walking distance, less than 10 min. to red line metro station, quiet neighbourhood, and most importantly, a really nice house. I highly recommend staying at Lidia's house. You will receive any help you need to move around the city and valuable indications about landmarks."
873383,145183938,2017-04-17T00:00:00.000Z,Isabelle took such great care of me when I visited Stockholm. She invited me to a fun afternoon out with her friends so I got to experience Stockholm like a real local. Her apartment was clean and easy to access by public transportation. She's also part of Stockholm's cool start-up scene and has some interesting projects in the works.
763407,13408662,2014-05-27T00:00:00.000Z,Gabriella was a gracious host. We had a great stay in her beautiful flat. Excellent location. Would stay there again. Highly recommended!

916806,123600767,2016-12-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Staying here made our Christmas very special as the lovely apartment was only 5 minutes walking from our daughter's apartment. It was a calm, spotlessly clean, comfortable place to come home to after the busyness of a family Christmas. We slept incredibly well every night!

This area is full of lovely walks to and near the lake and the apartment is part of a number of well looked after landscaped \" chain\" or \" semi-detached\" homes set high above the lake. There's a big deck outside which will be great to use for eating on or relaxing in the summer. 

The Skarholmen Shopping Centre sells everything one might need. The bus service to the Centre is very reliable as is the metro into the centre of beautiful Stockholm. We love going into the many amazing Museums and sites there.

We would definitely rent this apartment again in the future."
785218,302879462,2018-08-06T00:00:00.000Z,We had a brilliant holiday based at Fredrik's comfortable and stylish home. The location is excellent and it was very easy to get into the centre of Stockholm by bus. We loved being able to walk to a great place for swimming. We would love to return!

This little firecracker LOVES her adopted city and loves helping you navigate it.  Be prepared for a 20-30min tutorial when you first meet her.  She’s a storehouse of knowledge about the local sites and how to get to them.  (Ask her about the solar system display.)  
Her complex is HUGE and I got turned around more than once, but getting there via metro or bus is ridiculously easy ONCE YOU GET YOUR BEARINGS. 
I would certainly stay there again!"

The location was perfect - right off the metro and in a neighborhood fairly comparable to Williamsburg (Brooklyn, NY). There was plenty to do on that island (Sodermalm) and a quick walk to other islands. The accommodations were very clean and comfortable. Plenty of amenities and privacy. As a single traveling gal, I'm mindful of my safety, but both the neighborhood and building are very safe. I no concerns or issues there. July was the perfect time of year to visit Stockholm and I'm so glad I found Andy & Vannie's spot to stay. Thanks!"

The location is great - it's only 5 min walk to Tunnelbana (Metro) and 1 minute walk to grocery shop. If you are looking for a good place to stay while visiting Stockholm, that would be one of the best offers out there!"

She also took the time to sit down with me and give me an overview of the city, how to get around and what to see while i was there, which was really useful. The apartment is really easy to get to from central station and there airport (there's a commuter line station just round the corner), and its also close to a couple of metro lines for getting round the city"

But if you like alcohol, it is not good idea to bring in home, pork as well. If u want to stay in a place calm, friendly but not too much, staying Ali's home would be good idea."

The apartment is in a great location, very close to the Metro or, if you don't mind a bit of light exercise,  an easy walk into the heart of Sodermalm with lots of interesting shops to distract you on your journey. There are some lovely walking/running tracks around the water nearby which are definitely worth checking out! Emma's arrangements for picking up the keys was extremely easy and convenient ... Thank you Emma!"

541875,6229776,2013-08-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Through out the entire process of working with Martin distantly, he was courteous, polite, and rapidly responsive with every single email communication we had.  My daughter and her boyfriend were met by Martin's kind and polite representative in Stockholm at the agreed upon time (which we had to change at the last minute, yet Martin was totally flexible in accommodating us).  Helene guided them to the apartment and shared some nice tips about the neighborhood (e.g. a local jazz club was within walking distance). The apartment was perfect, clean, functional, and in one of the most desirable perfect Stockholm neighborhoods!  We can highly recommend anyone who is interest in staying in the center of Stockholm to contact Martin.  My words hardly express my thanks for all his help and support."
700113,278018517,2018-06-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Very bad experience. 
The previous guests had left late and apartment may not have been cleaned properly (e.g. there was still perishable food in the fridge). The bathroom had a very strong unpleasant smell as did the fridge, and the overall apartment smelt like air freshener - she had an electric one by the flat entrance which she took away as soon as we settled in. 
The mattress was much too soft, which made nearly impossible to sleep (to the point that any time you turned you could hear every single spring). 
We had to leave the apartment after one night only even though we had three booked, as our young son would not settle (things improved drastically when we got to a hotel). 
When we tried to provide constructive feedback privately she got defensive and rather rude. The host refused to acknowledge any issues with the bathroom, said that the fridge smell was because of us (even though it was there when we arrived). 
Very disappointing, and made things extremely stressful for us as travelling with young baby"
1182616,64114068,2016-02-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Värden var lättillgänglig och flexibel ordnade bra med in och utcheckningen. Det var ett bra läge , tyst rymligt rum in mot gård. Bra säng  bäddat och fräscht. Däremot var det ostädat och avloppssdoft i badrum."

Der Vermieter hat vorgeschlagen, dass man in der Not in unten gelegene Restaurant gehen kann. Das ist aber leider morgens noch nicht geöffnet."
757320,22970037,2014-11-18T00:00:00.000Z,Thanks for your hospitality. The location was   good. The room was clean and comfortable.

Even the two couches as sleeping facilities were really good. The public transport connection was really good, too. The bus station was only 3 walking minutes away and the line 1 drove us always (even during the nights in a 20 minutes stroke) within 15 minutes to cityterminalen (=main station). Scott was furthermore very helpful in providing information and he answered always promptly. 
I will return by all means!"
385701,171671414,2017-07-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Lots of space inside, divided in several areas. Large bedrooms. When we arrived, the house was not entirely clean: dusty surfaces and not so clean carpets. Set in green surroundings, but with a highway in the back and a busy road up front (when you leave the communal area). This is a bit noisy. Playground & Farsta center very nearby. Alex was very responsive whenever we had a problem or question."

581243,30561964,2015-04-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Suomeksi:
Huone oli erittäin puhdas ja kuvat vastaavat täysin todellisuutta. Edwin antoi meidän käyttää keittiötä aamupalojen ja välipalojen tekemiseen, myös jääkaappi oli meidän käytössä. Asunto sijaitsee Tukholman paremmalla alueella ja siellä oli täysin turvallista liikkua. Asunto on helppo löytää koska se sijaitsee aivan Karlaplanin metroaseman yläpuolella. Edwinin sai helposti kiinni emaililla ja hän oli oikein mukava.

In English:
The room was clean and exactly as it is in photos. We were allowed to use the kitchen and the fridge for breakfeast and small snacks. Edwin´s apartment is located in Stocholm's highend area. Apartment is very easy to reach with subway because it is located on top of the Karlaplan metro station. The area is safe and very close to most of the tourist attractions. Communication was very easy with Edwin and he was really nice to us."

Le logement correspond tout à fait à la description. Nous avons très bien dormi.
Le quartier est calme, et très bien desservit.
Nous recommandons ce logement et l'accueil de Li, qui est tout sourire, et d'une extrême gentillesse."
624886,297027302,2018-07-27T00:00:00.000Z,"We were very happy when we booked this house for our summer holidays with our two kids of 3 and 7 years old. When we arrive at the house, Oskar was there for giving us the key and explaining everything. As the house has been remodeled, the pictures don’t match with reality but we cannot get disappointed as we were completely in love with the decoration and the stunning new and modern kitchen; as with the kitchenware and tableware. The house is full of different lights that transforms it with a cozy ambience. The kids bedroom with the bunkbed, toys and kids books was thrilling. The main bedroom is super spacious and has Apple TV as we have at home! It is a big apartment full of books. The building has a lovely garden were you can enjoy too with the kids or I would have taken a book just for reading in the calm environment. 

There is a supermarket just crossing the street and other at the metro station and bus station on a 5 minute walk. The Flygbussarna stop is also at 5 minute walk. A great park with swimming pool for kids at 2 min walk. A nice bathing area at 10 min walk with the cozy Loopen Marina, is a must for experiencing the Swedish summer bathing. The Italian restaurant “La casa” was much better than expected and we like it a lot. We seemed the location was great, we have enjoyed Hornstull and very easy to reach Gamla Stan. 

Even we have found cleansiness was not accurate, we completely recommend this accommodation and we were happy to repeat it as well. 

Oskar has been a great host. He has been replying and solving our dudes. I feel grateful they have shared the house with us."
1096827,79713357,2016-06-13T00:00:00.000Z,"L'appartement d'Anita est un appartement \"habité\", pas seulement destiné à la location. Il a une âme au charme suranné. Certains le trouveront peut-être surchargé par rapport aux logements locatifs aseptisés mais moi j'ai adoré. L'appartement est propre.

Je ne vous apprendrez rien en vous disant que Stockholm est dispendieuse (pour un Québécois, en tout cas!), coûte la peau des fesses, comme dirait Victor Hugo... L'option de résider en banlieue est donc intéressante. L'appartement est tout près d'une sortie de métro-train, dans un quartier sécuritaire, avec une épicerie tout près. Peu ou pas de touristes dans le coin et on peut prendre une ballade en toute sécurité le soir, loin des foules, tout en goûtant la paisible vie de banlieue suédoise.

Il y a tout, vraiment tout pour cuisiner (et plus) et Anita nous donne accès à toutes les épices et condiments ou accessoires dans son appartement. De plus, elle nous avait garni le frigo de lait, fromage, saucisson en tranches, yogourt, de quelques fruits et j'en passe.

Quant à l'accueil, il a été des plus chaleureux, sentant qu'elle prenait vraiment à coeur notre séjour et notre bien-être.

À part le lit peut-être un peu étroit et mou, rien à redire."

The room is on the top floor which provided amazing views and the layout of the flat was very accomodating for two people.

Martin was a great host - though he wasn't in town at the time of my visit, he communicated perfectly and had his uncle meet me when when I arrived to show me around the space. Even when I accidentally locked myself out of the apartment, Martin and his uncle were so understanding. I especially appreciated that the kitchen was stocked with essential cooking items (including tea!), which Martin let me use. Thank you, Martin!"

But it was totally different than i thought, because Andrè was super amazing host!

He was being so kind, and friendly to us even we had never met before, just like old friend.!!
And he offers super-detail local infos and recommendation which is really helpful. 

The place is perfectly clean and neat more than the pics, close to the metro like a minute away by walk, and also a big grocery store near by.

302496,162702184,2017-06-22T00:00:00.000Z,Wonderful spacious and light apartment in a very pleasant residential area with restaurants and other shops in the area. Easy walks to the metro and only 15 minutes to central Stockholm by foot. All amenities in apartment worked very well. We understand that the owners have plans to upgrade the kitchen area very soon and this will make the facilities even better. Seta and her husband were extremely helpful and caring.
478105,191640802,2017-09-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Great host, very responsive and available. Location is convenient with 2 metro stops within walking distance, close to the city. Very much enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend."

700113,24108463,2014-12-20T00:00:00.000Z,"I stayed in Ilona's studio apartment for a month, and was very pleased with my stay (and in fact I've arranged to stay there again). It's a small but cosy apartment and has everything I needed. The studio apartment adjoins Ilona's own apartment but is separate and private. The apartment is centrally located but quiet. There's a nice little balcony which overlooks the park opposite. Ilona is friendly and helpful. She even did some laundry for me."
700113,518108477,2019-08-26T00:00:00.000Z,"It was a lovely place to stay, clean and good facilities. Good communication before arrival too."

259025,1410859,2012-06-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Sorry for late comment. I have been busy! 
Ali was very nice. I recommend anybody to stay in Ali's place!!!:)"

The flat is perfect for a family, everyone has their own space and it’s a very convenient location to the subway and great bus lines. We will definitely stay here again."
475409,2123656,2012-08-28T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment is in a great location, easy to get  to from the train station. Corretta was always contactable and was waiting as arranged when we arrived. The apartment was clean and had everything we needed.  Great weekend!"

242188,1386109,2012-05-30T00:00:00.000Z,From the moment I met Lidia she made me feel very welcome to stay in her comfortable home. I tend to stay to myself and this is a real change for me to stay in someones home. I have been in Sweden for over a month and I have never had a better sleep than what I had at Lidias.  She cannot seem to do enough for you. I have already passed her name along to a colleage of mine who frequently has people coming to Sweden on business. When you stay at Lidias you would be remissed to not take advantaged of her breakfast.
647314,7697272,2013-09-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Our stay at Mallika's place was simply perfect. A beautiful room in a cosy appartment, located in one of the greatest neighbourhood with very nice coffeebars, restaurants and shops. Mallika is a nice and easy going host, very agreeable to share the appartment with."
533880,11951637,2014-04-20T00:00:00.000Z,"We were 3 Danish girls visiting Stockholm in April 2014 and we had a perfect stay in Jarls apartment. Jarl had arranged it all in advance and it was very easy to find the apartment and the key due to his instructions. Jarl was not home during our stay, but we had frequently contact with him and he was very helpful and nice. Overall we enjoyed our stay very much and we give our recommendation."
1244657,160199273,2017-06-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Nic and Usha were fabulous hosts. They were kind, gave me good recommendations, and even let me come early and were gracious when I arrived earlier than expected!  I enjoyed talking with them and their home is clean, warmly decorated, and in a great location. I would stay again and highly recommend them to any traveler! Thank you!"
608672,493778720,2019-07-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice little spot with great hosts. Good area of town—close to restaurants, bars, and stores. I would stay here again. :)"

1248490,37278384,2015-07-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Marias home was up to all our expectations. It was a nice, clean appartement. The neighbourhood is quiet, but close to restaurants and shops. (Give the indian restaurant Shanti, on the grund floor in the building a try, it is really worth it). There is a nice balcony, with sun in the evening and view over backyards and rooftops. We were six persons, four adults and two children. Everybody enjoyed the stay. Maria welcomed us upon arrival, and was very kind and helpful. We would definetively recomend Marias appartement for a stay i Stockholm, and we would gladly return some  day. We rate it with 6 out of 6 stars!"
1212891,205476025,2017-10-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud was a great host overall. She provided everything we needed. Her, together with her cat, Sam, make that home so warm, cute and enjoyable. I really loved our stay, and would definitely stay with them again. Strongly recommend it!"
1182616,527087852,2019-09-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Peter is very good host, available for all your questions. The apartman is in a very good location and is good for a short stay."
313195,89578451,2016-07-29T00:00:00.000Z,"La casa es tal como se muestra en las fotos. Un pequeño detalle es que tiene sólo una ventana y no tiene ventiladores, y llega a hacer mucho calor.
A la hora de llegada David no estuvo presente y no atendió nuestras llamadas, por lo que pudimos entrar a la casa por pura casualidad (alguien amable llegó al edificio y nos abrió). Definitivamente este sistema debe cambiarse.
Más allá de eso, la casa es muy linda y la recomiendo"
164448,138879659,2017-03-22T00:00:00.000Z,Lidia is very friendly and engaged as a host and will make sure you enjoy your time at her house.  She has a fridge for her guests and also tea/coffee available for them to use.  It's a lovely little apartment.
302496,431539315,2019-04-01T00:00:00.000Z,"I was in Stockholm for my birthday celebration together with my family. The apartment was really spacious with three bedrooms, a living- and a dinning room perfect for the occasion! A new kitchen with all equipment you could wish for to make a nice dinner for family and friends. We really enjoyed our stay, close to everything, buses, metro, shops, restaurants and ten minutes walk to the city. Seta and Göran were very nice and easy to get in touch with, check in and check out went smooth. In other words, a top-level apartment with a top location."
770995,450084115,2019-05-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Peter a été un excellent hôte. Son appartement est très beau, chaleureux, facile d'accès  et idéalement placé près d'une station de métro ou de lignes de bus . Peter nous a réservé un excellent accueil et a su nous donner les bonnes adresses utiles du quartier ( commerces et restaurant). Nous avons passé un très bon moment chez lui. Le seul petit point négatif que nous aimerions signaler , est la moins bonne qualité du 3ème couchage en canapé lit par rapport aux deux autres lits qui sont des plus confortables. Les nuits ont été plus difficiles pour les amis qui y ont dormi. 
Nous recommandons malgré tout cette très bonne adresse."
1182616,57047120,2015-12-21T00:00:00.000Z,"It's was nice to live here,really closed to the subway station."
700113,272311922,2018-06-03T00:00:00.000Z,"I came with a friend to take part in the Stockholm marathon and the location of Ilona's flat was perfect to go to the stadium. The balcony, exposed to the sun after 5pm in June, proved to be exceptional to rest and to enjoy a well-deserved recovery dinner. :)"
299154,37278722,2015-07-06T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed 4 persons in Daniels apartment, and it was a lovely experience. Although small, the apartment's cosy atmosphere and central location provided us with a perfect base while exploring the city. Daniel was welcoming, flexible and thorough, we would all love to be back some time. Thanks!"
700113,45930728,2015-09-07T00:00:00.000Z,"The picture doesn't quite do the studio justice - if you stand the other way, you'd see the balcony where you can sit and have coffee overlooking the park, and Ilona goes out of her way to make the whole place feel very homey. Really a lovely place, one of the nicest Airbnb's I've stayed in, and great for long stays as you have a little kitchen to cook in, if you're so inclined. Otherwise, it's easy to walk just about anywhere, and the neighborhood is very safe, with lots of restaurants and cafes just a block or two away. Would happily come back any time."
1182616,18020349,2014-08-20T00:00:00.000Z,"We saw Peter once or twice only but he is a friendly person. His place is clean and the room was big but affordable. It is also very close to the fridhemsplan train station as well as many supermarkets and food places.

There were other guests staying at the same time as us but they were really friendly travellers. But the only con was that we had to queue to use the sole toilet sometimes which can get rather inconvenient.

Other than that, the place is great and highly recommended!"
1182616,185235725,2017-08-21T00:00:00.000Z,Nice room and great location. Balcony with windows which is nice in case of rainy weather. Communicatie with Peter went well. Bed is huge and comfy. Only minor thing was that sharing the bathroom with only toilet with all 5 people in the house (including guests in of het room) was not always convenient in the morning and evening. But apart from that a great stay!
1124388,7099226,2013-09-06T00:00:00.000Z,Lovely cosy flat in Stockholm with quick transport links to the city centre. We had a fantastic time and really liked the flat. We'd definitely recommend!

700113,10514859,2014-02-23T00:00:00.000Z,Ilona's apartment was just as described and seen in the pictures.  She was a fabulous hostess.  Would definitely stay here again.
1212891,430780479,2019-03-31T00:00:00.000Z,The apartment offers everything you need to spend some days in Stockholm! Although you share kitchen and bath you are pretty free in use because Maud is flexible. She also is hospitable and will help you/answer your questions whenever she can!
1137050,10391833,2014-02-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Gabriel was very welcoming ; he gave us many details about how to get to the flat from the airport, which were really useful. His flat is clear, quiet, clean and spacious, just what you would love after a long day outside, to feel comfortable and \"at home\". I deeply recommend."
274876,510681454,2019-08-16T00:00:00.000Z,Many thanks Emma. Your apartment really helped us to enjoy Stockholm.
242188,1534057,2012-06-22T00:00:00.000Z,Very pleasant room and flat (plus a generous breakfast) in central Stockholm location. Would certainly recommend. Thanks Lid for everything!

164448,166297913,2017-07-03T00:00:00.000Z,"We enjoyed our stay at Lidia's during our five days in Stockholm.  The apartment is well located and comfortable.  Lidia was very attentive, providing excellent information about the city's cultural offerings.  We would stay with Lidia on our next trip to Stockholm!"
581243,134817672,2017-03-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Super sauberes Zimmer/Bad und Edwin war sehr zuvorkommend und freundlich. Alles so wie beschrieben. Einkaufsmöglichkeiten und Bahnanbindung direkt vor Ort. Wir empfehlen mit Gepäck nicht vom Hbf hin zu laufen, ist angenehmer und einfacher mit der Bahn (dauert 5 Minuten). Sehr zu empfehlen!"
1263558,131174810,2017-02-11T00:00:00.000Z,"L'appartement est parfait, propre, décoré avec beaucoup de goût, un style épuré conforme à l'art du design suédois. Carl et Cécila se sont montrés très disponibles malgré le fait qu'ils étaient en voyage à l'étranger. Cécilia parle très bien le français, ce qui a facilité la communication pour moi. De plus, l'appartement est très bien situé, à la fois calme mais proche du centre historique de la ville. Il est également proche d'une station de métro et plusieurs bus peuvent être pris. Tous les commerces et restaurants sont à proximité. Je recommande fortement cette adresse."

242188,60899723,2016-01-29T00:00:00.000Z,"This was my first time using Air BnB and Lidia made it a great experience. She was super friendly, had tons of brochures and maps ready upon arrival. Everything was super clean and completely set up to completely accommodate guests. She was in a great location too. My last night she gave me and another guest tea and we chatted. She also helped me book a taxi for the next morning. She is very generous and a great hostess."
533880,30797959,2015-04-27T00:00:00.000Z,Jarl's apartment was in a good central location (only two stops from Central station!). Supermarket and bakery 2 minutes walk away. Jarl was friendly and welcoming. Great guy and great price for where you stay! Would definitely recommend it
647314,4875373,2013-05-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Great location, very central and really good for what we needed- lovely bedroom for a two night stay in town."
873383,48942370,2015-09-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Thanks to Isabelle, her warm welcome made me feel like home already even on my first day in Stockholm. The flat was clean and Isabelle is an easy-going person whom I can talk to if I need anything. I would recommend to anyone who is looking for apartments in Stockholm."
954832,26188046,2015-02-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Mikael met me at the gate of the apartment block and was very helpful giving information on the apartment and the area including what sights to see in Stockholm.  The apartment is very nice, clean and very warm!  I was worried about this beforehand as it was winter, snowing and about -4 degrees outside.  It is also very quiet and I felt safe walking from there to Stockholm Waterfront conference centre daily at 6.30am.  It is close to shops, transport, the coach stop to the airport and a supermarket.  A very nice place  to stay and it's a shame I couldn't stay for longer.  The centre of Stockholm is quite small, so is easy to walk round and I managed to fit in a visit to Gamla Stan and the fabulous Abba museum too as well as 3 days work.  Thank you to my hosts."
1128990,67322508,2016-03-28T00:00:00.000Z,Thanx to Yvonne. She was a very gentle host and we appreciate her friendly personality over the four days in her flat in Söder.
954832,245636479,2018-03-23T00:00:00.000Z,Mikeal’s place was one of the best airbnb I have ever been to. He is a super host!

1173290,24525786,2014-12-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Christian's apartment is truly beautiful, cosy, and well located.
We spend 6 days there, 5 adults, and we felt home instantly. Christian welcomed us very nicely, and he had left brochures about the city and instructions for the apartment. 
He was also very helpful and receptive to give us a hand to prepare our trip in stockholm.

The neighborhood is nice, calm, we found all we needed (supermarkets, wine sailer...) very close to the house, and you can be in the city center easily and fast with the subway.

We all really enjoyed our stay at Christian place, and we will recommended it for any family who'd like to go in Stockholm.  

Thank you Christian for this stay !!"
700113,70125513,2016-04-16T00:00:00.000Z,Had a lovely stay in Ilonas apartment. She is such a nice person. Would love to see her again. Maybe one day I will stay at her place again.
1158893,18706628,2014-08-31T00:00:00.000Z,"The house was fantastic for our family of 3 adults and 2 children. A BIG thank you to Dany for the warm welcome and for making our stay easy and comfortable. Our girls were ecstatic : lots of toys to play with, a trampoline, a big garden... The neighborhood was quiet and kid-friendly with a nice playground nearby and a supermarket. Stockholm is a wonderful place to visit and the access to the Metro was easy. A wonderful experience ! :-)"
242188,217423899,2017-12-09T00:00:00.000Z,Sentralt. Rent. Fantastisk vertinne.
220851,511412042,2019-08-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Frederic is a great host, I felt welcome right away. The apartment is very nice, with great artwork all around. I also really enjoyed the nice neighborhood with lots of good restaurants.  I hope to be back in Stockholm some day and would definitely stay at Frederic's place again."
795354,50106189,2015-10-09T00:00:00.000Z,Gustav was a very welcoming and hospitable host. He was very easy to communicate with ahead of time and then flexible with our check in. The apartment was a in great location and was exactly as it looks in the pictures. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again next time we're in Stockholm.
916806,36540651,2015-06-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice place, quiet and really nice view of the area. Close to bus and train stations so transport is convenient. Huge shopping mall within walking distance.
The studio apartment was just the right size for the two of us. It was clean and tidy and had everyone we need.
Mansour was a great host, providing an information pack on arrival so everything was explained. He was also very prompt with his responses whenever we had a question.
Highly recommended."
1212891,245931928,2018-03-24T00:00:00.000Z,Maud was a wonderful guest and Sammy is really friendly:)
581243,183861439,2017-08-18T00:00:00.000Z,"You'll notice Edwin is a super clean and careful person. And I found him very polite and organized. He has made me really comfortable during my stay and kindly greeted me and taught me how to use elevator, door etc. since Sweden was very new to me. Edwin is very knowledgeable abt which tickets for transportation is the best for you, and nice area to visit etc. and really if there's any question, you should ask. He will be prompt and kind to help you out. He's cool abt letting me use the kitchen, and even said it was ok to keep my stinky cheese in the refrigerator :) The only thing I've found difficult was that sometimes wifi was not working fast in my room. But I have a feeling the modem is not close to my room and may not be for everyone."
1158791,9581999,2014-01-03T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed one week in Alex's appartment. The location is very convenient, it's 10 minutes away from the city center, and 2 minutes away from supermarkets and the subway station.
The appartment is very clean, bright (quiet a good thing when it's dark at 3.00 pm during the winter time). 
Beside this we got some candies as a welcome present, which is a very nice attention from Alex.
If I have to find a small negative thing it would the noise from passing cars in the street. As we are used to have a very quiet environment where we live, we were a bite disturbed by the street noises at the begining, but we got used to it. Beside this the traffic is pretty low, only few cars/buses per hours. 
The appartment can be recommanded without any problem."
700113,189920052,2017-09-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Ilona's studio was a good find in Stockholm. Everything you need is there - clean room, comfortable bed, kitchen and bathroom.  She was kind enough to accommodate my check-in and check-out time, which I greatly appreciated :)  I had a chance to  briefly see her cute companies (a dog and a cat) too.  Thank you Ilona."
700113,56707214,2015-12-16T00:00:00.000Z,"The studio is very centrally located, I actually only used a taxi to get there once - after that I always travelled on foot. It takes you half an hour to any central part of the city. The studio was clean and quiet and Ilona was a great host."
206221,78605194,2016-06-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Elisabeth was a wonderful host and we had a very enjoyable stay at her apartment. She provided a delicious breakfast each morning. It was an easy walk into the \"Old town\" from her apartment and the local underground station was just a short walk. The accommodation was very comfortable and quiet. Thanks for the hospitality Elisabeth!
