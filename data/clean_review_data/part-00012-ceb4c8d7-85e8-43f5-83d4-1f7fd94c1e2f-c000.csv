Plus, Edwin is a very helpful person and a warmly host."

1128990,14288036,2014-06-16T00:00:00.000Z,"We were met by a friend of our host who very helpfully showed us round the apartment, gave us neighbourhood advice for cafes/restaurants etc, explained the arrangements about check out, and gave us a contact number if there were any problems. Our host had already told us about this and left us some very welcome provisions in the fridge, especially helpful as we arrived quite late in the day, had not visited the area before and do not speak Swedish!
The apartment was very well located for a lovely part of Stockholm (Sodermalm) and we were very pleased with all the facilities the apartment and area offered - great for families. We really appreciated having a bath as we had our 1 year old grandson with us, though some people might prefer a more standard shower facility."
700113,261252100,2018-05-06T00:00:00.000Z,"The appartement was clean and nice, located in the north of Stockholm in a nice neightborhood with good restaurants and a park across the street! You can walk to the old city center or take a metro closeby! Definetely a good place to stay in a super Nice city!"
1307331,277943739,2018-06-17T00:00:00.000Z,"La casa è a 3 minuti a piedi dal metro che in 10/15 minuti collega il centro città.
E' vicina ad un bel lago dove è possibile fare il bagno.
Marcus è stato gentilissimo aspettandoci fuori dal metrò per il check-in e posticipando al primo pomeriggio per il check-out.
La casa è spaziosa, completa di tutto e con una stanza piena di giochi per i bambini."
1149820,26242330,2015-02-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Great appartment in a perfect place ! The room is very clean and beautiful. And Klara is a very nice and sympathic girl :) ."
274876,303870945,2018-08-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice apartment, close to restaurants and a big park. Good for small family.  Host was very helpful."
954832,17215625,2014-08-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Mikael was a great host, one of the best I have come across on AirBnB! Communication was brilliant and he was very accommodating when we arrived in Stockholm. He provided us with lots of useful information about the area we were staying and also things to do whilst we were in the city. The apartment is beautiful, quiet and really clean and tidy. Great facilities too, everything you would need for a short stay in Stockholm! He recommended places to eat and drink as well as providing us with maps and other information leaflets for us to take a look at. Perfect location as the nearest t-bana station is only two stops away from central station. I would definitely recommend staying here :)! x"
206221,1419307,2012-06-05T00:00:00.000Z,"We loved Stockholm and we really liked Elisabeth´s place. The house is big and nice and the bedroom is also more than enough to spend some days. Big bedroom with space enough for the luggage. Personally, I loved the location. The Sofo area is a cool, dynamic and beautiful area with lot of cafés, nice shops, restaurants and supermarkets around. Just perfect. If you don´t mind to walk, you can even walk for a while to the old side of the city. Elisabeth is a great host who sure is going to make you feel at home. As they said, breakfasts are more than great and her company and advice are a big plus."
1212891,54999429,2015-11-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud is amazing! I recommend her to anyone! She is a very kind and accommodating host.  My boyfriend and I stayed two nights in Novemeber.  We truly appreciated her generosity when she prepared a homemade meal for us.  We talked a lot and Maud showed us some personal family photos.  Her cats are sweet and social.  The room itself was very private and homey.  The bed was extremely comfortable and the perfect size for two adults.  The location was far enough away from the city where we were amongst locals and away from a lot of tourist traps.  The metro was close so it was a short ride into the heart of Stockholm.  I would advise purchasing a 72 hour SL access card for the train upon arriving.  Overall, we had a great time with Maud and would stay with her again in a heartbeat."
700113,19739222,2014-09-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Small clean cosy apartment that has everything you need. Located in a quiet area and close to all: cafes, restaurants, supermarkets, public transportation, etc. Ilona is a wonderful host."
164448,407660,2011-07-30T00:00:00.000Z,great fun at lidia's. she had the power adapter i needed. (try getting that at a hotel). and advice on stockholm. bright top floor and a quirky cork light switch worth the visit alone.
274876,320731955,2018-09-09T00:00:00.000Z,Emma’s place is lovely. It has all the things you need to enjoy Stockholm at the fullest. The apartment is really nice with a great balcony where you can enjoy the sun all day long if you want. The location is also perfect with great bars and restaurants nearby. Emma was always responding really quickly so everything was well arranged. I would recommend it to everyone!
688947,92542680,2016-08-09T00:00:00.000Z,Everything is ok. The flat is comfortable and clean. Alexandre is very nice and friendly. I recommend it.
1234109,7134324,2013-09-08T00:00:00.000Z,"We really enjoyed our stay in Stockholm and at Natalie's - the central location of the apartment  - our home away from home - was a  blessing. Natalie  met us as we arrived and were very friendly and ackommendating all throughout our stay. 
Thank you, Natalie and all the best to you !"
541875,15506024,2014-07-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Thank you so much Martin.
Martin was away and left his whole studio to myself.  He arranged a friend to pick me up from the station and showed me around.  We communicated through email and tried to help me in anyway he could.
The location is perfect. The local train station and bus station is just a footstep away.  Two train stops and you’re at the Old Town (5 min).  The local café serves great food.
Again, thank you very much Martin."
1204621,78413410,2016-06-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Appartement très sympa, bien situé et très propre. Lit comfortable avec 3 oreillers différents pour satisfaire les plus difficiles :). 
Nettan est très cool et sympa. Très compréhensive, elle m'a permis de quitter l'appartement en fin d'après-midi."
1184553,85815919,2016-07-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Annbritt was an excellent host. We have been able to check in earlier than expected, she was lovely and very flexible. Also great communication before and during our stay to make our stay comfortable !
The apartment was perfect for two. It is very spacious, full of light and the room is great. The bed is comfy, there is a table to dine in the room, and even a TV and the view is amazing!
The apartment is located in Soderlalm just 20 min walk from GamlaStan the old town. The neighborhood is so cute, with little shops coffee and restaurants and only 20 min walk from the see to have a walk. 
Thanks for this amazing stay in Stockholm ! I highly recommend this place"
581243,3086716,2012-12-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin was very helpful and accommodating. My flight from Copenhagen was cancelled and I effectively landed at 1 AM at Stockholm right after a major snow storm. He stayed awake and guided me to his apartment. All the days of stay there was very pleasant. The location is very convenient, right across the street from the Metro station and above a mall (which had a few eating places and a grocery) !! All in all, am very pleased with the stay and Edwin is a great person !!"
536283,17568929,2014-08-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Hi! We highly recommend Paolo's place for a Stockholm stay. The place itself is comfortable, clean, and easily located. Centrally located, steps from a subway stop and restaurants and supermarkets. 
Paolo himself was nice, polite and helpful, easily accesible and eager to help and answer all our queries.
Recomiendo el piso de Paolo para vuestra estancia. Es cómodo y muy bien situado, a dos manzanas de una parada de metro y de varios supermercados. Paolo es muy educado y nos ayudó resolviendo todas nuestras dudas en el momento."
568341,424376715,2019-03-16T00:00:00.000Z,Highly recommended
1184553,505273010,2019-08-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Annbritt è stata molto gentile e disponibile, sempre pronta a rispondere a dubbi e domande durante la permanenza. Il suo appartamento è bellissimo, pulito, in una zona molto vicina al centro città, con la metro e i negozi a pochi passi e un sacco di locali carini. Ho letto dei commenti sulla confusione in tarda serata, ma non sono d'accordo. Il quartiere è tranquillo e anche se nei weekend è più affollato di sera, non ho avuto alcun fastidio. Inoltre, le finestre dell'appartamento sono spesse e perciò non arrivano rumori dall'esterno se sono chiuse.
L'appartamento di Annbritt è ideale se si vuole essere vicini al centro per esplorare la città ma anche vicini ai locali per uscire di sera o andare per negozi."
1204621,80303032,2016-06-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Nettan was very welcoming and provided a lovely space. The location was a short walk from the Filmhuset, which was perfect for what I needed in Stockholm."
220851,438280012,2019-04-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Very nice place to stay. The flat is in an old house, very charming with high ceilings and wooden floors. The bedroom is big and the kitchen lovely. There are supermarkets, bars, cafés and restaurants all around and the metro station is very close. I recommand this place and will come back if I'm back in Stockholm
!"
299154,510403145,2019-08-16T00:00:00.000Z,Perfect apartment. Everything was so clean and the apartment has a privileged location.
755843,146891689,2017-04-24T00:00:00.000Z,"The only regret was that we didn't meet Pär in person, but communication is certainly not lacking with timely responses on (Hidden by Airbnb) and airbnb. The apartment is beautiful and roomy and is located very close to Stockholm's places of interest.
In addition, the apartment is provided with several poster, stock maps with information about the main points of interest of the city.
If I go back to Stockholm I hope I can stay at Pär's apartment again."
338470,37222553,2015-07-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Flat very well located, easy access to underground, clean and comfortable. Gustaf and his brother Carl are very nice guys and helped us with some tips about the city."
700113,510509079,2019-08-16T00:00:00.000Z,"L’appartement est très pratique avec un agréable balcon. Bien situé, à proximité de la station Odenplan, il est fonctionnel et llona est très gentille et réactive"
1261445,131182564,2017-02-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Marie-Louise is a very gracious and attentive host. Her place is cozy and very comfortable. The location is great, with easy access to public transportation."
647314,5244235,2013-06-20T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a great experience staying four nights at Mallika's appartment at the end of June. Mallika is a very helpful host and sharing the flat with her was very easy. The room is very spacious and bright, nicely decorated, as seen on the pictures. She has two cats, but they're very easy going and they will not bother you nor enter your room if you dont want to. 

We specially enjoyed the neighborhood. Mariatorget is a charming area, full of cafes, beautiful shops. It offers some splendid panoramic views of the city. Apart from our arrival and departure (which were made very easy thanks to the metro station just down the block), we always walked to other areas of the city, or used the public bike system.

Mallika's appartment is the perfect place to start exploring Stockholm."
1182616,42151476,2015-08-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Der Vermieter hat schnell geantwortet und war unkompliziert und flexibel, was meine frühe An- und späte Abreise betraf. Seine Wegbeschreibung war sehr exakt und hilfreich. Die Location ist echt zentral, Busse und Metro fast direkt vor der Haustür, und in wenigen Minuten ist man so in der Innenstadt. Was man durch die Airbnb-Anzeige nicht erfährt: Der Vermieter wohnt nicht im Apartment, stattdessen werden alle 3 Zimmer vermietet. Zeitweise waren wir 7 Gäste, die sich ein Bad teilen mussten. Hauptproblem war, dass der ganze Ort (Küche, Zimmer und leider auch das Bad) nicht wirklich sauber waren. Es roch auch etwas merkwürdig. Ich war bei der Buchung froh, noch etwas Zentrales zu finden, das nicht allzu teuer war. Trotzdem würde ich dieses Zimmer nicht wieder buchen."
338470,1203959,2012-04-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Gustav's apartment is located in one of the most beautiful areas of the city centre. It's the perfect flat for a couple who want to fully enjoy their stay in Stockholm. It is also very comfortable, bright and romantic!
Gustav is very nice and extremly helpful in giving tips on places to visit and restaurants.
I would definitely recommend Gustav's flat!!"
954832,13896264,2014-06-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Fantastic - the apartment exceeded our expectations. Mikael was welcoming and helpful, the room was clean, well stocked with amenities, comfortable bed and good size bathroom. Close to metro and buses."
299154,457143396,2019-05-23T00:00:00.000Z,A very good location! Can recommend.
343925,12016296,2014-04-21T00:00:00.000Z,"We were very satisfied with Annika's appartment, it is at a great location, with metro station just around the corner, not far away from main bus station by foot either, in a calm area, tidy,comfortable and convenient, with well equipped kitchen (though we didnt cook at all), just what we needed for our short stay in Stockholm. The only thing is that I wouldn't recommend it for more than 2 guests, because it was really difficult to inflate the airbed without the electric air pump...or it's just us being clumsy :D 
Annika was very welcoming (we arrived before the check in time because of our flight ) and helpful. I recommend her place."
299154,35368634,2015-06-18T00:00:00.000Z,"The location of this apartment is excellent for exploring Stockholm. It is easy to find and has everything you need within walking distance - subway, shops, restaurants, and cafes. Daniel met us at the apartment, showed us around, and answered any questions we had. He was very kind and helpful. There were 4 of us (2 adults and 2 kids) and it was a tight fit for us and all of our luggage, but it worked perfectly for us. Access to Wifi was great and I appreciated all of Daniel's guide books and helpful information. We had everything we needed and enjoyed our stay. Before our stay, Daniel was always very fast at responding to any emails and texts."
568341,428590375,2019-03-25T00:00:00.000Z,Be sure to take the tour!  It is exceptional!
164448,92751268,2016-08-09T00:00:00.000Z,Lovely! She knew a lot about the area and the public transportation. The room was very nice.
1035775,18560838,2014-08-28T00:00:00.000Z,"We enjoyed our stay at Magnus' flat very much. It's clean, the bed is comfortabel, super furnishing, location is very good...all in all one of the best opportunities for a low-cost stay near the center. I loved the big balcony with sun during the afternoon and evening! Thank you Magnus! I will recommend your stylish flat!"
1212891,61777294,2016-02-08T00:00:00.000Z,It was a very nice stay at Maud's place. She helps a lot in helping us searching for the right transport or anything while we're in Stockholm. There's also a cafe around the neighborhood that you can stop by and have some coffee on the way back. It's just an awesome experience in the nutshell.
1128990,8374717,2013-10-28T00:00:00.000Z,"I booked this apartment for my friends. It is the very comfortable apartment.

Anette is so kind that she helped me a lot  before I booked. My friends who stayed here had great time!

I highly recommend the apartment and Anette as host."

1234109,504737366,2019-08-08T00:00:00.000Z,"It really is a wonderful apartment with everything you need for your stay in Stockholm. It is central and you have a part in the Swedish lifestyle. Nathalie has an open ear for your questions and has helpful tips online as well. She is really great, kind and trusting. Thanks for our good time in Stockholm."
608672,21515984,2014-10-19T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed at Karl's over the weekend and we had a very pleasant experience, the room is nice and clean with also a small kitchen for breakfast or snacks. The position is fantastic, at walking distance from all main attractions and just behind the main walking shopping street. Karl speaks a perfect Italian since he lived 10 years between Torino and Roma. All in all definitely recommended! Grazie Karl!"
916806,146465294,2017-04-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Nous avions réservé ce logement pour un long We à Stockholm. Comme l'hôte l'indique, il y a 1 métro à 10 min. de marche, lequel nous emmène en ville en 20 min. Nous avons apprécié ce trajet parmi les suédois, pour arriver dans un secteur très calme (parfait pour bien dormir après une longue journée de marche)."
299154,164754670,2017-06-29T00:00:00.000Z,Daniel was so quick to accommodate any special requests and the location was awesome! The apartment was just a short walk to Galla Stan and pretty much everything else you need to see in Stockholm.
1271843,449197018,2019-05-06T00:00:00.000Z,"André est un hôte très attentif, réactif. Il n'était pas souvent présent durant notre séjour et avons pu avoir l'appartement pour nous ! Il nous a même laissé un vélo pour flâner dans les vieilles rues de Stockholm et est de très bon conseil ! Je le recommande les yeux fermés. Il est très réactif lorsque nous posons une question, réponse dans l'heure. De plus, André est une personne qui nous met directement à l'aise. 
Que du bonheur !"
302496,32229874,2015-05-16T00:00:00.000Z,"We were two couples from the U.S. and England visiting Stockholm and were thrilled to find such a lovely apartment in a well-maintained building and in a perfect location.   The proximity to the bus, metro, and Coop in an active yet quiet area allowed us to meet and talk with locals as we traveled with ease to other areas of the city.  

Seta's son, Christopher, met us at the apartment and kindly walked us through the apartment giving us information and advice.  He made us feel very welcome.   Seta herself was often in touch through email.    

We know you will enjoy the experience as much as we have."
763407,16000170,2014-07-20T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed at this place for the second time. The previous visit happened last summer and we were then so satisfied we decided to come back again. And everything was just as good as it was the last time! The flat is very functional, perfect for a family and the location is simply excellent. Public transport from this place is easy to any location in Stockholm. Gabriella accommodated our wishes very well and gave new travel tips, for example restaurant recommendations that turned out to be really good. We recommend Gabriellas flat to everyone!"
795354,152975548,2017-05-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Amazing host, location and apartment will definitely try to book it every time I visit Sweden. Made my visit perfect!"
647314,286343148,2018-07-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Beautiful, eclectic apartment with a great little balcony attached to the room. Excellent location near a bunch of great restaurants and cafes. It was a little awkward sharing the space and the bathroom since it is a one bedroom."
757320,42176813,2015-08-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Barb was a great host. She was so welcoming and helpful. The apartment and the room was well arranged. The neighbourhood, I would say, one of the best places in Stockholm with a quick access to best and trendiest restaurants and cafes."
1307331,144593835,2017-04-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Quiet area, very well located near the metro station, supermarket, farmacy. Possibility of parking. It was perfect for 8 persons and there is a big table to have meals together. Owner very helpful."
1170766,29516729,2015-04-08T00:00:00.000Z,"I give this accommodation, and the host, the highest possible recommendation. The place is very nice, and as described on the site. It is an excellent location with all amenities nearby. Many restaurants and cool stores a 2 min walk from the door, and the subway is about 3 min away. The place is comfortable and warm, has a deck and many skylights. The host is a very nice lady and takes good care of her guests. Well worth the price asked!

I am sorry to leave! :)"
845365,271752244,2018-06-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Michael had recently returned from travelling and was busy and my booking was short notice. Even so, he was a very accommodating and helpful host. His tip to take go to take the bus to the airport from Liljeholmen station, rather than return to central station, was spot on. There's a small restaurant near his apartment open late serving things like pizza and kebab - really nice when I returned late (late just being around 12:00 or 1:00 in this case) and hungry."
1124388,13504382,2014-05-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Lovely little flat, good transport links and a very kind and obliging host.

723539,47308754,2015-09-17T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment is very well located, just few steps away from Stureplan - in the surrounding area there are a lot of restaurant and shops.

The flat was very clean and comfortable. I arrived late in the night but the landlord has been quite flexible and he found a way to get me the keys.

There is a nice balcony, but weather doesn’t always allow to use it…

Definitely a great alternative to the hotel of the area, which are very expensive."
755843,363222057,2018-12-28T00:00:00.000Z,Apartment is spacious and stylish. It’s within walking distance to supermarket and subway station. A short walk along the river will take you to the Cityhall. Apartment also has a lovely balcony where you can watch the sunrise. Host also welcomed us with a bottle of sparkling wine. We had a fabulous 5 night stay during Christmas.
1205051,39267644,2015-07-22T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment is perfect for two, perfect location to explore Södermalm, great cafés, pubs, restaurants around the corner. Everything was clean and we found everything we needed. The only thing we were missing, is the pingpong table ;)

242188,49980337,2015-10-08T00:00:00.000Z,"I arrived late from my flight and local train to her neighborhood but Lidia was waiting for me at midnight. Her instructions on getting to the apartment from airport was very clear and I had no problems. The neighborhood was very nice with many cafes, restaurants and grocery stores.  It was situated near public transportation and located to all the places I wanted to see.  She helped me with some recommendations, the cost and how to get there. The description of the room was exactly  told and the photos were exact.  I just needed a simple bedroom, clean and quiet and that was what I got. She was very kind to me."

The indications to reach your location are clear and travelling by bus is a nice way also to discover the landscape ! We arrived during snow time and your appartment has a nice view . All is made to facilited our stay on an easy going way but all is planned in kitchen and bathroom.
A perfect place to be part of swedish life.

The room is very small, but if you just want to sleep somewhere its a good place. You have your own bathroom and basically dont have to do anything with the hosts"
1182616,8013495,2013-10-12T00:00:00.000Z,"We didn't see Peter much as he was busy and we were busy but from our short encounters he was nice, polite and welcoming. Clearly he takes this seriously and is quite professional with his guests.

The place is close to a selection of supermarkets and the train station is a short walk away taking you to the city center in no time. Our room was big and clean as was the bathroom and kitchen. I would definitely stay there again and that is as good a recommendation as anyone can give."
581243,4798682,2013-05-27T00:00:00.000Z,"The place is really great and easy to find. The location is perfect (near the subway station but you can also reach everything on foot). 
Edwin is really nice. His place is amazing: huge and clean flat, big and confortable room. I enjoyed my stay in Stockholm very much!"

La ubicación muy buena, un vecindario muy tranquilo, accesible desde la estación central con el metro en solo unos minutos. La casa de Maud muy acogedora y limpia con todas las condiciones tanto para dormir como el baño y la cocina. Todo muy bien organizado. Maud muy amable y dispuesta a ayudar en todo lo posible, pone a tu disposición café, te y otros básicos para cocinar. También gel de baño, champú y otros productos para el baño. 
Muy contenta con mi estancia en su casa, si volvemos seguro repetiremos :) Ahhh y Sammy, el gato todo un personaje, muy lindo y tranquilo."

757320,49920051,2015-10-07T00:00:00.000Z,"A friend and I stayed at Barb's home for 3 nights and we felt really comfortable! The room is nice, you have a bathroom almost of your own and the bed is very cushy. Barb is a friendly host, it was nice to talk to her but she also leaves you on your own.
The neighbourhood is perfect for shopping and exploring Stockholm by foot, like Gamla Stan is in 10 minutes walking distance.
So we had a great stay and would recommend Barb's appartment! :)"

1271843,278953178,2018-06-19T00:00:00.000Z,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for 4 nights and loved André’s place. He left us the whole apartment for most of our time there, but we were lucky to get to hang out and talk to him twice - he had a couple great recommendations and was generally just fun to talk to. The room was great and exactly as described in the listing. The apartment as a whole was beautifully decorated, and we appreciated being able to use the kitchen to cook for ourselves. Possibly the best part about this place was the location, though: easily reached from the airport by public transit and walkable from most spots we wanted to visit. We highly recommend staying here!"
1244357,91534184,2016-08-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Elliotts appartment was a great stay for us. A great location within Stockholm, with a subway station in walking distance and also up to 7 different bus lines. We found the apartment very clean and with instructions on everything we needed to know from it (and also recommendations for our stay in Stockholm). We weren’t able to meet Elliott, but communication with him was very easy, and he was answering right away when we had some question. You won’t regret staying in Elliotts apartment when coming to Stockholm."

We especially appreciated the bright and well-equipped kitchen and the grocery store just around the block. As long as you don't mind a short commute, it is very easy to get to the city centre from Carl's place with public transit. Carl himself was eager to provide tips for us, and quick to answer any questions. 

Thanks again for a being a wonderful host, Carl!"
1170766,20766166,2014-10-05T00:00:00.000Z,A perfect place to feel truly independent in Stockholm. I had a perfect stay.
145320,325592745,2018-09-20T00:00:00.000Z,Kim’s place is perfect size for two guests. The location is walking distance to a major public transit station as well as several bus stops as well depending on which direction you wish to go. The bed is comfortable and clean. Kim greeted us and made us feel very welcome. I’d have no issues with staying here again
1182616,10006623,2014-01-25T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed in Peter's flat for 4days and it was our first experience with airbnb. Thats was great: you really feel like home and you can ask everything about the country.. Peter was a really good host even if we didn't meet him a lot. The place isn't far from the heart of stckhlm and the walk by the water to go there is really fabulous!"

Gustav is very responsive to any question I had and even searched the apartment for me afterwards for something I’d left. Plenty of space for two people with all of the amenities you’d need!

Der Blick über die Dächer der Altstadt ist atemberaubend. Trotz ihrer zentralen Lage ist die Wohnung sehr ruhig. Alles war blitzeblank sauer und praktisch eingerichtet. Majken und Emil waren fürsorgliche Gastgeber. Die Kommunikation mit Ihnen war zuverlässig und herzlich.  Für eine Stadterkundung ist die Wohnung ideal gelegen, man kann fußläufig den Bahnhof und alle wichtigen Sehenswürdigkeiten erreichen."

The apartment is very bright, spacious, clean and comfortable, it was pleasure to return here after tiring days visiting the sights of Stockholm. We did not meet Anita but she communicated quickly by e-mail giving us very clear directions about how to find the apartment, she also left us food which was very welcome as we arrived quite late.  The apartment is in a very pretty and  quiet area so there was no problem having a good nights sleep -there was no noise from the restaurant downstairs. The apartment is less than five minutes walk from Sansborg T banna which will get you into central Stockholm in about 15 minutes.  This was my first Airbnb experience and I would highly recommend Anita as a host."
647314,2216698,2012-09-06T00:00:00.000Z,"I spent 15 days in the very big room of the Mallika's apartment. The flat is located in Södermalm, one of the best neighborhood of Stockholm, full of life, with lots of cafe, restaurants and pubs. The house is 3 minutes far from the metro and the street is very calm and silent, even if you are 5 minutes walking from the coolest part of the city. 
The apartment is really beautiful, with a kitchen fully equiped with everything you can need and the room is bright and spacious. I spent some days working home for my research and the place was perfect. 
Mallika is the best owner you can meet! She is very nice and helpfull and full of good energy that make you fill home after 3 seconds. She helps me to find places in Stockholm and suggest me things to do in this wonderful city.
I really loved to stay there!"

His communication was excellent and he provided detailed information on how to get to the apartment. He was a very welcoming and friendly host and the room and apartment was extremely well looked after. The room was simple but very clean and comfortable and I think it was good value for Stockholm, which can be an expensive city. I would definitely recommend Edwin's place."

The house is located at five to ten-minute walks from the metro stations and bus stops also. Lidia stays at the first floor, and the guests at the second floor. There were three guest teams altogether but we had no difficulty using the bathroom. We had a lot of conversation with Lidia and the other guest, a German lady, sharing cultures and experiences. The most fascinating point with Lidia was that she pinpointed some really nice tourists' attractions in Stockholm, which was quite helpful for us to visit super worthy places. We recommend Lidia's house with both our thumbs up! We will also definitely stay at her house on our next visit to Stockholm for one to two weeks. Our stay at Lidia's house was one of the best Airbnb experiences ever. Thank you for everything, Lidia. Take care.

Sincerely Yours,"

We enjoyed our stay a lot because the hosts are very friendly and you feel welcome from the first moment on. It's like you're part of their family.
Thank you so much for giving us all the advices (e. g. bus timetable for each place we wanted to visit), the breakfast and the little indish cooking lesson :-) 
We always felt very welcome, you are a lovely family. We wish you all the best!"

The flat is much larger then it looks in the photos and David was great about communication prior to our arrival.  Lovely stay!"
533880,2778973,2012-11-01T00:00:00.000Z,"I stayed in Jarl's apartment for two nights with three friends of mine. The apartment was spacious, clean, and cozy. It's located in a nice area close to the city center, so you can get anywhere without any issues. I only met with Jarl once, but he was really nice and so helpful- I was sick and he helped me find medicine! He was helpful with any of our questions, and provided us with breakfast,which was much appreciated. I loved Stockholm, and I will look into staying here again if I come back!"

757320,52342212,2015-10-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Barb est très accueillante et son accueil était chaleureux. L'appartement est très bien situé: proche du métro et à 15 minutes à pieds seulement du centre ville. Le quartier de l'appartement est très agréable, il y a des restaurants et le quartier est joli à visiter. Le seul bémol serait peut-être le manque d'espace dans l'appartement (seulement une petite chambre) et le partage de la salle de bain. Mais l'ensemble reste très confortable et agréable."
1124388,99402879,2016-09-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Carl's apartment is really as cosy as described--I felt very comfortable there. Carl was there when I arrived and he checked in during my stay to make sure I had everything I needed. The apartment is equipped with everything needed for both a business and private trip and the 10 to 15-minute bus ride from the central station makes it conveniently located. The neighborhood is very quiet, but the busier parts of the city are within easy reach."
206221,2265069,2012-09-11T00:00:00.000Z,"We spent one week at Elisabeth's place in Stockholm. The apartment is well situated, between 2 metro stations yet it's in a calm street.
She was nice and welcoming. And although she is living in that flat too, we had a spare key and so were free to go come and go whenever we wanted. And sure the breakfast we had every morning was nicer than buying a pair of rolls every single day.
All in all it was a nice stay, much better than any hostels or low price hotels you can find for the same price. Only one thing we regret, there were two single beds in our romm with no possibility to put them side by side.
That being said, we recommend this facility if you're about to visit the beautiful city of Stockholm, capital of Sweden."

1182616,69875579,2016-04-14T00:00:00.000Z,"The description matches the actual situation quite well. There are some euphemizations here and there but nothing outrageous. However, it is interesting to know that all the rooms in the appartment are rented out here on Airbnb. Regardless whether that's something good or bad, it means that there will probably be more people staying than the appartment was designed for, which can lead to annoying queueing at the bathroom in the morning. Peter himself remained physically invisible during the entire process, but was responding quickly to questions asked by e-mail."
448259,433313292,2019-04-06T00:00:00.000Z,"I stayed Ali's place for about 4 months. This place is very close to Rinkeby centrum, and super easy access to Stockholm central city (about 20 min by subway). I mostly recommend persons who have business in Stockholm University or Karolinska Institutet, because there is bus stop for directing Stockholm University and Hallonbergen, then exchanging bus to Karolinska Institutet. Ali is a nice host with high hospitality, and provide comfortable time with clean space during your stay here. In particular, other accommodation costs very high in Stockholm. Ali's place is cost reasonable, but comfortable and clean as I mentioned above. I say again, I recommend strongly to stay here during your trip."

Peter's place is in a residential neighborhood just a short walk from the city center, so we were close to pretty much everything. There was even a cool local grocery store right across the street, with others within a few blocks. The apartment was very stylish and clean, and overall a great place to rest and sleep after long days walking around Stockholm. Peter was very communicative, and gave us tips on finding  a cab from the airport to his place, where he met with us to show us around. He also had tips on local restaurants and things to do as well. Check-out was easy, and Peter called to make sure we had a great stay!"

608672,302772417,2018-08-06T00:00:00.000Z,Friendly host and a good location. The room was separated from  owners apartment and has own entrance. Sounds from main apartment could still be easily heard. The bathroom needs an urgent renovation.

Sanna has created a warm, comfortable, stylish home we loved staying in.  The apartment is in the heart of 'Sofo' in Södermalm and is minutes away from a range of excellent, unique restaurants, bars, shops, galleries etc.  It is within walking distance of all the main areas of interest in Stockholm - we only used the train twice in four days!.

Sanna was friendly and responsive from first contact.  She gave us a warm welcome on arrival and made some great recommendations for places to eat and drink.

We can't wait to go back.  Thank you Sanna!"

954832,209815774,2017-11-06T00:00:00.000Z,This place is great!  Mikael gave me tons of ideas for things to do and places to go - I only did a fraction of them.  It just means that I will have to come back again and stay at Mikael’s place.  He had many brochures of interesting places I didn’t think to go see.  The apartment itself was spotless.  The bed was very comfortable and I slept like a baby.  I would highly recommend this location.

The neighborhood of Sodermalm is great; many good coffee shops and restaurants nearby. The apartment is well-equipped, with a fully stocked kitchen, spacious bathroom, and comfortable bed. There are also two lovely balconies to enjoy when the weather is nice!"

The location was fantastic - right in the middle of everything, with easy access to all of the places we wanted to go.  The surrounding shops and cafes were also great fun.  Daniel was very responsive and welcoming.  The only downside was that we had to get on a plane and come back to the real world eventually."

Nos recomendó muchos lugares a visitar sobre todo los museos (que hay muchos gratis). La casa tiene una ubicación bastante céntrica y tienes a disposición un centro comercial donde hay varios supermercados, tiendas de ropa, expresso house, macdonals, etc. Además justo enfrente hay una parada de bus y metro. 
Merece la pena visitar Estocolmo y si buscas un sitio acogedor esta es tu casa."

Actually I did´t get the single room that was shown in the advertisement even if I booked the room about 9 months ago.  But it didn´t matter. It mattered more that Lidia was so kind and helpful. She gave me a lot of information and good suggestions how to come around in Stockholm. As my cable for to charge my mobil phone didn´t work she borrowed me her cable for the time I stayed there. So I was able to take the photos and keep in contact with my family and friends. I was even able to practise my swedish with her. She was really a patient person to listen to me and to talk swedish with me even if I did not speak it so well. She had during my visit also some other guests staying there and they were also very nice. I enjoeyd the conversation with Lidia and her guests. It was so nice to stay in her flat,  I feld like home! I recommend Lidia and her flat for everybody who would stay a while in Stockholm."

As soon as I arrived, she helped me to figure out where I was going and what I wanted to do. She was friendly and kind, and was always ready to help in any way possible. And the breakfasts were delicious!  She was also located in a very convenient part of Stockholm, easily accessible to the majority of the city. I would recommend staying with Lidia to anyone!"

We more than had everything we needed, including run of the fridge, coffee machine, and toiletries and other thoughtful additions dotted around. André was very responsive before and during our stay, making sure everything was going smoothly for us. You can reach lots of good restaurants, bars and cafes on foot, and easily walk to Gamla Stan, the Fotografiska, and Slussen to catch boats. The metro is really close too. A tip - don't take loads of cash to Stockholm, lots of places are card only :) Thanks André, hope to be back one day!"

620848,3285729,2013-01-06T00:00:00.000Z,Hannas apartment is incredible large and well-kept. This and the previous communication (where she gave really good clues to explore Sthlm) made our stay really awesome. Hanna picked us up at the train-station (approx. 5min walk) and showed us her apartment. It was a perfect decision to discover Sthlm with an apartment only 2 stations away from T-Centralen or the Old town. We can recommend Hannas apartment in any! way and wish a pleasent stay in this wonderful city! :-)

The neighborhood is great. Shopping, public transport, and nature! 
Hopefully this won't be our last trip to Stockholm! We would definitely stay here again."

Küche ist ein kleiner Raum mit Fenster, Kühlschrank, Mikrowelle, 2 Herdplatten (mobil), Kaffeemaschine, Geschirr, Töpfe, Besteck. Kein Wasseranschluss. Das Geschirr muss mit einer kleinen Wanne im Bad abgespült werden. Ist aber kein Problem. Funktioniert gut. WLAN funktioniert tadellos. Das Apartment ist sehr hellhörig, da es von der Wohnung des Vermieters nur mittels abgesperrten Zimmertüren abgetrennt wurde. Da dieser aber keinen Lärm macht, ist das kein Problem. Ich hoffe, ich war auch nicht zu laut :-). Hat mir gut gefallen. Ich kann die Unterkunft empfehlen."

Flexible, willing to help me out with anything (when I suggested I might get lost, they gave me one of their cell phones, and I could use a card for public transport in Stockholm). They made me feel very welcome and served excellent , fresh(not too spicy!!) Indian food and told about their lives and experiences. 
The surroundings of Akalla are surpringely beautiful, fields, forests, farm, all of it was near, as was the subway to Stockholm itself."

302496,1622750,2012-07-03T00:00:00.000Z,"This flat/penthouse is absolutely amazing! I was so lucky to have found it and I enjoyed every minute of it during my 8 day stay there. Simply stated: you must stay here if you are in Stockholm. It is located in Norrmalm, one of the most sought-after areas of Stockholm, and is conveniently located to every attraction. Gamla Stan is only a quick and beautiful 25 minute walk away, the Stureplan district is maybe a 20 minute walk away. In the immediate neighborhood there is a small grocery store right across the street, an amazing Thai food stand/gourmet truck one block away, and for any Americans who may have withdrawls from lack of ranch dressing and an overabundance of ice (aka Me!) there is a Hard Rock Cafe 2-3 blocks away. Not to mention the numerous bakeries and coffeehouses within one block. I absolutely adored this flat: amazing views of a beautiful part of Stockholm, all the unique and beautiful art in the flat (the large painting in the dining room was the topic one night at dinner), the lovely foyer entrance, the (Website hidden by Airbnb) was absolutely perfect. And the flat is in a building that is over 100 years old, so you have the old architecture and the really nifty old elevator. And Seta is a perfect host-she is very friendly, nice, easy to communicate with, and when I had any questions she answered via text or offered to call right away. And this was Midsommar weekend, so you know she had other plans going on, but she was still very fast in replying. When I come back to Sweden again in the future, I will absolutely be staying here! I think anyone who has a chance to stay in this flat and passes it up is crazy-you simply must stay here."
581243,7621130,2013-09-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin was an enthusiastic host eager to offer what he could to help my experience in Stockholm go smooth and be enjoyable.

He left towels and sheets for me and my guest, and even told me to help myself to his kitchen! While I did not get a chance to meet Menaf in person, he was communicative throughout the stay and was always available to answer any questions.  The apartment itself was in a great location-- close to the metro and airport shuttle stop and in a hip little neighborhood. I would highly recommend his place for anyone visiting stockholm!"

Gabriel has been a fantastic host : he explained everything to them (in french !), showed them the neighborhood, helped them to purchase transport tickets... He answered very quickly when they had a question and even booked their taxi for the way back to the aiport. 
The appartment is at a perfect place, close to the subway, bus stop in the street, walking distance to everything (my parents are 70 and 75, they didn't think they could do everything so easily). The neighborhood is very friendly, appartment cosy and well equiped, nice balcony, perfect for a couple.

It’s in a good area that is close to public transportation as well as shops and restaurants. We were able to walk to all of the main sights from Daniel’s place, but you could also take public transportation which is only a few minutes away. The space is cozy but easily fits 2 people. It was homey and had everything we needed for a 3 day weekend exploring Stockholm!"

Dany met us at the home, went through everything with us and even helped us order pizza delivery as we had been traveling all day and were exhausted.  He called and ordered taxi pick ups for us on our departing day.  Dany made us feel like we were at home."

The flat was in a great location in walking distance from popular hot spots as well as the trains and buses. The place itself was very clean and presentable, spacious living room and comfortable bedroom. I only wished there were more towels and pillows. Aside from that the place is a definite recommendation for anyone's stay in Stockholm."
647314,38370966,2015-07-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Es hat uns sehr gefallen in Mallikas Unterkunft. Das Zimmer war genug gross für 3 Personen und die Lage ist sehr ruhig und dennoch zentral. In der Nähe der Wohnung hat es Möglichkeiten zu frühstücken.
Mallika ist eine ruhige und aufmerksame Gastgeberin.
Wir haben uns im geschmackvoll eingerichteten Appartement sehr wohl gefühlt.
Preis - Leistung hat für uns gepasst."
274876,4992397,2013-06-06T00:00:00.000Z,"We really enjoyed our stay at Emma's place. Arriving late in the evening, Emma awaited us, made us feel at home very soon and gave a tour of the place. She had even bought bread for the next morning's breakfast! 

Emma's place is perfectly fitted for a company of 5. It is located in a quiet neighborhood but within walking distance of the old town. Södermalm is the place to be if you enjoy vintage shops and cafés, nice little parks and a friendly relaxed atmosphere.

We stayd at Emma's for 5 nights and it felt like we lived in Stockholm! We were out most of the day but had dinner near the apartment in some of the surrounding little restaurants. It felt great coming home at night in such a relaxing neighborhood.

I definitely recommend Emma and her place and we would stay here again if we were to come to Stockholm again with 4 or 5 people.

Thank you Emma!"
776155,27211272,2015-02-28T00:00:00.000Z,"I had a fantastic stay at Ann-Sofie's apartment in Stockholm in February.  Ann-Sofie greeted me at the apartment and was very accommodating when my flight was canceled and arrived two days later than scheduled.  Her apartment is lovely, it looks just like the photos provided, and was very clean.  Ann-Sofie asked what I wanted for breakfast and also left many details you don't always get with airbnb apartments - a robe and slippers, toiletries, washing powder, etc.  In fact when I inquired about the washing machine in the apartment and offered to bring my own washing powder she told me not too and to use what she had provided instead.  The apartment is a very short walk to the Odenplan metro stop and there are plenty of grocery stores and restaurants in the area.  It was a very easy experience and I would recommend this apartment to anyone.  Thanks Ann-Sofie!"

Shocking was the kitchen where we have found dead worms in drawers with cutlers.  Wi-fi internet have not worked as a password was not available, but finally after reseting a modem we could at least connect via a cable. Bathroom was very simple too. In total the quality of the apparmtent does not correspond to price we paid."
242188,209504097,2017-11-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Li is offering a comfortable and convenient place in her flat on the 5th floor with a view. Li stays on the lower floor and the top floor is for guests. The place is very convenient with clean bathroom and shower, own fridge, tea and coffee, and is very clean in general. Li is very friendly and flexible on checkin and arrival times.  Just 10 minutes walk to the subway, and lots of restaurants close by. I will come back for sure."
647314,80230476,2016-06-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Good stay at Mallika's apartment ! The apartment is large and especially the bedroom, with a lot of space. Very clean as well. Beautiful colours in every rooms.
Mallika is very kind and polite. And her cat is very gentle.
Around the apartment, the neighbourhood is very quiet with a lot of place to eat. The subway stop Mariatorget is at 2 minutes walking.

Très bon séjour dans l'appartement de Mallika. Très bel endroit, avec de grands espaces, de très belles couleurs et très propre. Le quartier est très sympa et très calme, avec beaucoup d'endroit pour sortir dîner. Très proche du métro."

862528,38275738,2015-07-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Thanks Arne to It was a wonderful place. Very neat and clean, excellent location. Green, as the title says. Spacious living room, bed room and outside garden was all making a fantastic stay for 2 families with 2 young kids. Arne kept everything in a convenient place, with an excellent welcome note explaining things about the house and the neighborhood. We had a wonderful barbeque & cycling session too in the backyard. Would love to have such apartments and hosts wherever we travel. 7 star host & the apartment."
442837,205101287,2017-10-21T00:00:00.000Z,"The location is very good for transportation, however, the room size is extremely small. Cleaningness may be a concern if you are staying more than 2 days."
757320,106040489,2016-10-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Barb is very friendly and welcoming - she even waited for us until late in the night as our flight was delayed. The room is nice and the Location is just perfect. Metro Station, cafes and restaurants are in 2-3 min walking distance. We can highly recommend it for a sightseeing trip to Stockholm. Thank you, Barb!"
1153177,6173828,2013-08-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Excellent place to stay in Stockholm, the whole city is reachable by feet but metro is very close if you prefer. Apartment is large, clear and sunny. We got a excellent welcome from Terry who is very friendly. We felt at home. The only small point is that we would have preferred firmer mattress.
We encourage you to choose this address."
242188,45599868,2015-09-04T00:00:00.000Z,"I had a swell time at Lidia's place.  The neighborhood she lives in is excellent and downtown Stockholm is only one train station away.  Lidia is an awesome host -  very welcoming and very helpful.  For instance on my last day I had to take a train to the airport and had gone out for a bit to check out the neighborhood. When I came back Lidia had a small slip of paper listing the available train times and the connecting bus times and the bus number that I would need.  On my first day Lidia helped me with sight seeing trips given my time constraints.  The room is quite comfortable for a single person and has a nice bed.  The bathroom is a shared one.

Given another chance I would definitely stay at Lidia's place."
242188,65256070,2016-03-12T00:00:00.000Z,"A nice, clean room and very helpful landlady. I stayed 2nd time and will come back!"
757320,268229202,2018-05-24T00:00:00.000Z,"It's a clean space, nearby transportation and things to see. Room is very bright in the morning and can be difficult to sleep through. 

Two mornings, host came into our room unnannounced while we were sleeping to ask some logistical questions, which was a bit strange."
1182616,37094461,2015-07-04T00:00:00.000Z,"I didn't personally meet Peter, as we arranged an alternative way to get the keys, but what a great space! Really lovely room with a balcony centrally located in Stockholm. The bathroom space is shared, which can be challenging as there were 7-8 guests staying in the (3 room) apartment during my trip. Large shared kitchen area with lots of tourist brochures can be used for cooking or hanging out."
299154,248917172,2018-04-01T00:00:00.000Z,The flat is in a nice district and it is only 5 minutes walking to Gamla Stan. It's a small flat but it's very cozy. Daniel was an excellent host and the communication was exceptional.
453692,2898012,2012-11-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Lovisa is a great and friendly host, and she gave us a warm welcome for our late check-in on the day of arrival. The apartment is a great place to stay if you would like to explore for the Stockholm city. Highly recommend for everyone!"
581243,146470018,2017-04-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin's place is immaculately clean, in a beautiful neighbourhood and conveniently located above a shopping centre and train station. He was also so helpful at check-in and very respectful of privacy throughout my stay. It was as if I were alone! I couldn't imagine a more perfect stay in Stockholm and would highly recommend! :-)"

She was also always availabe during our stay in Stockholm :) She made us feel very welcome and as a cat lover we felt especially comfortable at her place!

858902,37968879,2015-07-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice location. Residential area, quiet and clean. Close to attractions and lots of good restaurants. Host is very kind and gave useful information about the city and tourist attractions. The room was neat and cozy, cool enough in summer. Really enjoyed staying there!"
299154,5795841,2013-07-16T00:00:00.000Z,Great location and nice apartment. We enjoyed the stay in Daniel's place!
628555,415192854,2019-02-22T00:00:00.000Z,The host canceled this reservation 13 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1204621,453237310,2019-05-15T00:00:00.000Z,Super easy to work with and a really comfy bed.
536691,12687110,2014-05-08T00:00:00.000Z,We very much enjoyed our stay at Cecilia's flat.  It is spacious and light.  The location is also excellent with good cafes nearby and a metro station only a minute away.
581243,242570684,2018-03-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin's great: Very friendly, quick to respond and certainly made me feel welcome even when I booked late in the day. Clean, spacious room and Edwins gives you access to all the essentials you need for a nice stay in Stockholm."
610948,529791497,2019-09-15T00:00:00.000Z,"The location is excellent, there are lots of shops and stores nearby, and at walking distance to major attractions in the city. The apartment is very organized and clean. Communication was excellent and the host was always available to answer questions during the entire stay. I highly recommend it and would definitely stay there again!"
164448,43253288,2015-08-18T00:00:00.000Z,Lidia is a very polite lady that help us during all our stay. It was very quiet and the room was comfortable
757320,18961981,2014-09-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Barbs Wohnung liegt direkt auf Södermalm, mit sehr guten Ubahn- Verbindungen und Einkaufsmöglichkeiten. Das Zimmer ist nicht ganz leise, da es direkt an einer relativ großen Strasse liegt, der Lärmpegel nachts ist aber gut erträglich. Wir kamen etwas zu spät an, da unser Zug aufgrund einer Bombendrohung in Stockholm (kein Witz!) öfters liegenblieb. Barb war not amused, anscheinend hatte sie Probleme unsere Sms zu verstehen bzw. zu empfangen (Tipp: Immer anrufen). Im Anschluss daran, versuchte Sie die etwas gedrückte Stimmung aufzulockern, was allerdings durch das Aufstellen einiger sehr bestimmte Wohnungsregeln nur teilweise gelang. Barb ist für Ihr Alter durchaus flexibel, hat aber ihre Eigenheiten. Ansonsten hatten wir während der drei Tage keinen Grund zu klagen, die Wohnung ist wie gesagt sehr hübsch gelegen. Am Abend vor unserer Abreise teilte Sie uns allerdings mit, dass Sie es vorziehen würde wenn wir am nächsten Tag möglichst früh (ca. 9. Uhr) weiterzeihen würden, was wir dann auch gerne taten. 
Alles in Allem war es ok, wir hatten einen etwas frostigen Start mit ihr, aber insgesamt können wir Barb weiterempfehlen (vor allem an Leute Mitte 30 aufwärts)."
1251466,17808588,2014-08-17T00:00:00.000Z,"We have been at Dean's for one night. Pro: The metro is really close and with the lowest ticket fare you can reach the center of the city, in about 10-15 minutes. Dean is kind and gave us a lot of privacy. He also provided clean bed linen and large soft bathroom towels. Cons: The room was ok, a very very comfortable bed, small table, little couch and microwave+waterboiler on the ground. It is ok for a very short stay, but the price should be lower. The bathroom is small and could have been more clean, as the rest of the house. Last but not least, the pictures displayed for this flat do not much the real one."
838442,138138659,2017-03-19T00:00:00.000Z,Bardzo dobra lokalizacja!
757320,104026638,2016-09-25T00:00:00.000Z,"I had a great time in her place. The place is really convenient to go everywhere because it is very close to subway station, to Slussun and  to places in city center. She was so kind and helped me a lot."
299154,49243852,2015-10-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Thanks Daniel for being our host, the communication with the host was incredibly fast and easy. The check in/out time was convenient, as we agreed. The host received us in the apartment and showed us what we need.
The apartment is located in an amazing place just nearby the old town but though a bit far from the central railway station. 
The neighborhood is nice and lively, all of the groceries can be gotten easily with a lot of other restaurants.
From inside, it was a bit small for 4 people, a lot of stuff that we did not need, but it was clean.
Overall, our stay was amazing."
954832,165464799,2017-07-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Perfect accommodation in Stockholm. Mikael has provided EVERYTHING that you might need for a short or long stay. Clean, lovely bed and bathroom. Hairdryer, iron and board, books, great wifi, umbrellas, lovely kitchen .... everything!! A wonderful location close to public transport and great cafes, restaurants and attractions. We spent an exceptionally comfortable 5 nights in this wonderful accommodation. Extremely highly recommended."

1231897,460093308,2019-05-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Alexander is a thoughtful, kind and accommodating host. He tries hard to make your stay comfortable. He met my wife and I in front of his house when we arrived, and escorted us into his building. We had made the reservation rather last minute, so he had to scramble to get the place ready, but he was good spirited about it. He gave us tips about local transportation and grocery stores. 

His place is extremely conveniently located to the subway and grocery stores - both just a 6 min walk away. It's also a very safe and residential neighborhood. Our plans changed last minute so we had to cut short our stay, and he was very understanding about that too.

All in all its a great place for someone who wants a no-frills, no-fuss, convenient location to commute to Stockholm City, or to chill out."
565912,37633328,2015-07-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Vi havde løbende en dialog om hvordan vi kunne overtage huset, da familien Löfgren ikke var til stede, men ude at rejse. Det gik rigtig fint og vi følte os velkomne. Vi nød at bo i det charmerende hus!"
1212891,321451264,2018-09-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Tutto ok, stanza comoda e in buona posizione rispetto al centro città ( 10 minuti di metropolitana).  Consigliato!"
1170766,72959348,2016-05-05T00:00:00.000Z,"We loved Annika's studio!  It's cosy, comfortable and inspiring with lots of great light.  Sodermalm is cool spot and this neighborhood was very convenient- full of shops and restaurants and the T-bana is just two blocks away.  Annika was a wonderful host and made sure we had everything we needed for a great week in Stockholm. Thanks Annika!"
858902,529748229,2019-09-15T00:00:00.000Z,"It was a great stay and a very friendly, hepful host. The room is very clean and the location central. Highly recommended."
1212891,264884681,2018-05-15T00:00:00.000Z,친절하고 따뜻한 응대가 너무 좋았습니다. 거리는 주요도시까지 30분 안에 거의 도착할 수 있고 버스 지하철 모두 가깝고 바다도 바로 보이는 아주 훌륭하고 조용한 마을입니다. 그리고 매우 안전하고 친절한 동네였어요.
1271843,411955667,2019-02-14T00:00:00.000Z,"One of the best Airbnb experiences ever! Incredible, stylish and spacious apartment with all the amenities one could want or expect. Andre is a very thoughtful and kind host. The location is truly one of the best in Stockholm. Excellent in every way!"
299154,519313665,2019-08-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Situation de l'appartement vraiment exceptionnelle.
Métro à 50 m.
Balcon Hyper agréable.
Cuisine bien équipée.
Cet appartement nous a mis tout de suite à l'aise car il n'est pas aseptisé : on se sent bien, comme à la maison. Un léger désordre règne mais cela est très rassurant.
Je recommande vivement !"
1212891,273453937,2018-06-06T00:00:00.000Z,We had a great trip and the room was very clean and cute. It was a little bit of a walk to the center city (~45 mins) but it was pleasant in June.
1182616,34748216,2015-06-11T00:00:00.000Z,"The listing was exactly as is and we enjoyed our stay in Stockholm. We met Peter once and he was super nice and very courteous. The room was a nice size and the bathroom was right next to the room. The patio was also one of the best parts because it was relaxing after a long day. Overall, we had a great stay."
533880,4577444,2013-05-13T00:00:00.000Z,"I enjoyed the apartment and the place where it is located. Not so far from city centre. Moreover you can have access to sauna and gym. Jarl is really nice, and gentle."
608672,164367117,2017-06-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Excellent location near a metro station and 2 stops from Central Station. Exiting from the metro on Tegnergatan, if you go left and do a u-turn, there are a lot of steps to climb, tricky with luggage. If you go right and walk a block, then you can go up a hill and the apartment is at that end.

A few parks close by, a 7-11 and Lidl (pick up breakfast pastries for cheap prices), shops and restaurants are not far. Two metro stops north at St Eriksplan and across the road is Chokladfabriken for awesome hot chocolate and next door is StikkiNikki for gelato.

One stop south is Hotorget with lots of shops and see Haymarket food hall.

Two stops south is Central Station with lots of shopping and restaurants, 3 stops south takes you to Gamla Stan and 4 stops south takes you to Slussen where you can take a lift down to the bus depot and only 1 stop away is Viking Line if you're cruising. Fotografiska is also not too far away."
700113,162774043,2017-06-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Very nice and cosy studio, looks at least as good in real as in the pictures. It has a nice balkony with a beautiful view on the park. Ilona warmly welcomed me, even after having been much later than expected due to flight delays. You don't need to enter the house to enter the studio, so I would consider it as a very private place."
1124388,76606116,2016-05-28T00:00:00.000Z,"We loved our stay in Carl's place! It was clean, beautifully designed, and perfect for our four days in Stockholm. Carl left a list of sites and restaurants to visit along with plenty of maps and brochures. The apartment is on a small, quiet island that is only a short bus ride away from the bigger parts of the city but perfect for a more relaxing experience of Stockholm."
700113,312818644,2018-08-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Sweet little apartment in the Vasastan neighbourhood with plenty of restaurants and supermarkets near by - we found it easy to walk everywhere else in the city (half hour to central) from here. Lovely to have a balcony for breakfasts/coffee (there's a good bakery round the corner!) It's a compact space but comfortable, well kept/equipped, and efficiently laid out. Ilona herself is very friendly, we would definitely recommend staying at her studio."
1048668,276323488,2018-06-13T00:00:00.000Z,Loved the location. The bus right outside the house straight to Liljeholmen was very convenient. The shared laundry room in the adjacent building was also a very convenient add on. We loved the cheery kitchen that was well stocked and served as the hub of our stay. Thanks Melissa for all your local insight and guidance that you patiently shared with us.
608672,56181556,2015-12-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Karl's pre trip communication helpful as was when he provided a key to the flat  He also provided some insight/recommendations for places to see and eat. The location is pretty good;  10 minutes from bus or train stations,  near shopping,  old city,  ferries are all 20 to 30 minutes away by foot. 
The place is very, very basic. 
The only issue was the bathroom. The place was built in the late 1890s or so so there are limits to any renovation you can do. The place is an \"apartment\" only because it has a separate entry way from the main suite (the doors to the main suite in the place still exist) to the main foyer entry.   It is a one room--former bedroom-- place with a two piece bath and a poorly designed third piece as a \"shower\"  which is not enclosed in the bathroom. This is not uncommon however the bathroom floor ends up with water standing on the floor as the drain top sits above the floor/water level. These means you need to squeegee the water off the floor and into the drain every time you shower or you step in water every time you go into the bathroom. 
The closet hasthe coffee maker, 2 burner hot plate,  microwave and small refrigerator one on top of another. While convenient on one hand,  could be dangerous in another. 
Despite these items, it is an acceptable place for one person. I, personally, would not have 2 persons here due to the limited space available."
608672,13026896,2014-05-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Location, location, location! Karl's apartment is in a great location, just minutes away from every thing, and is very clean, cosy and private. Karl is a very accommodating and helpful host. I highly recommend Karl as a host."
581243,3854875,2013-03-21T00:00:00.000Z,"This is my second experience with Airbnb, and Edwin could have not been a better host. He was always extremely eager to help. He speaks 4 languages fluently, and we really had a great time chatting with him. He also made excellent recommendations on what to sight see and also where to eat. 
The pictures do not really do justice to the apartment. It is much better than what appears on them. It has a lot of light and it is, one of the most important items for me at least, really really clean.
We recommend staying at Edwin's and we will do it when we go back to Stockholm for sure.
Thanks for the really nice stay, Edwin!"
1170027,5889686,2013-07-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Diana has a really nice appartment in a calm area of Stockholm. The public transport to the city center is very good, one can get there by using a single metro line. We enjoyed our time much and I can recommend this apartment for anyone who is looking for a nice p[lace to stay in Stockholm for an affordable price."
1054406,143956893,2017-04-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Thomas and Madeleine's place was the perfect base for our visit to Stockholm.  The apartment is exactly as you see in the pictures - clean, spacious, and equipped with all the amenities a group or family needs for several days in Stockholm.  The location is just as described...a couple of bus stops within a five minute walk taking you, after a short ride, to direct metro service to the center of Gamla Stan (old town) and Central Station.  Thomas and Madeleine are great hosts.  Communication throughout was great, and they stocked the apartment with some basic groceries to help us get started.   We will definitely be staying there again if we return to Stockholm."
1182616,131681134,2017-02-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Peters flat is centrally located and therefore a great place to stay. Rooms are still quite though. 
We didn't meet Peter in person (he doesn't live in this flat, all three rooms are shared on airbnb) but communication through airbnb messenger was good and responsive. 
It's possible to reach the central station within 15-20 minutes. 
Shower isn't really separated from the rest of the bathroom, which is worth mentioning for people who didn't see that before."
755843,312722143,2018-08-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Comfortable and spacious apartment. 
Flexible check-in time, friendly check-in information. Convenience of bus stop right in front of apartment. 
Par's apartment is the apartment where he lives. 
I could not see him. But I guess he will be a kind and generous traveler through his apartment.
Thank you for Par's favour and sparkling wine.^^"

The apartment is very comfortable and cleaned. It was my first time in Stockholm and I loved is so much partly because of the great house we lived in. 
If I could characterize Jacob and his apartment in 3 tags, i would use: comfort, friendship, care"

Мод гостеприимна и очень-очень деликатна, если нужна какая-то помощь или совет, к ней можно обратиться практически в любое время суток, а если хочется уединения, то никто беспокоить не будет. Все очень грамотно организовано, в том числе на кухне и в ванной. В квартире есть все необходимое, очень чисто. Кунгсхольмен - отличный уютный район, прямо влюбились в него. До метро 3 минуты, а на нем всего 10 минут по прямой до Гамла Стана. Мы один раз даже прогулялись пешком из центра - это заняло минут 40. Рядом с домом большой супермаркет и алкомаркет (Мод все расскажет и покажет). Ну и конечно совершенно очаровал Сэмми!"

472015,1629366,2012-07-04T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a lovely time in Stockholm, and Lotta's place was a perfect home base to explore.  There was plenty of room, it was very comfortable, and the neighborhood was very safe.  Thanks so much for sharing your house with us!"
442837,75502454,2016-05-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Přijetí bylo velmi vřelé a cítil jsem víceméně přátelskou atmosféru. Popis víceméně odpovídá realitě, byt je slunný, čistý, pokojík je sice malý a plně dostačuje (Wi-Fi, stůl a židle s pracovním stolem). Hostitelka velmi ochotně poradí s veškerými dalšími dotazy. V okolí je vynikající občanská vybavenost a pěkný park s jezerem na běhání. Ideální je také jak doprava z letiště (jedním autobusem až před dům), tak do centra (několik zastávek metra) ."
647314,199535218,2017-10-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Only a block away from the Mariatorget T stop, Mallika's apartment is the perfect base for exploring Stockholm. We walked around Södermalm and took short metro rides elsewhere. 

The room itself is whimsically decorated, clean and cosy. The shower's water pressure isn't the best and the bathroom a bit poky, but it's an old building, I understand.

It was easy to communicate with Mallika prior to our arrival as well as during our stay. This review would be incomplete without mentioning Ramses, the world's friendliest cat. He hung out with us at night, sprawled at the foot of the bed, and it was the best!"
1048260,67378867,2016-03-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Annika was a wonderful host! She originally was going to meet us at the train station and walk us back to her flat, which was lovely. We ended up arriving several hours late due to delayed flights, and she was very accommodating with our travel issues and letting us know how to get the keys. The flat itself is really nice - beautifully decorated, clean, and cozy. The location was perfect - just a ten minute (or less) walk from the train station on the most central train line, making it easy to get to anywhere in Stockholm. The flat was also very quiet. I would definitely recommend staying here!"
347192,101164664,2016-09-12T00:00:00.000Z,"This place is charming, nice and clean. We enjoyed staying here for our weekend in Stockholm. Its very central - short distances to everything you need. Nice area. Communication with Tilda was also great. Wifi didnt work, but we didnt really make a lot of effort to try to fix it. We had a lovely weekend, and would definitely recommend it to others."
1304431,93232945,2016-08-12T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment was even nicer as shown in the pictures; it is a lovely place to spend some time in a great town. If you want, you can find everything to cook or to eat just around the apartment. Thanks a lot to Madeleine, we are so glad that we stayed there."

1262188,8392119,2013-10-28T00:00:00.000Z,"The flat has a orginal plan which let circulate ideally light and energies and it is tastefully decorated. 

My two boys have liked very much the playground. It's true you can drink a tea on the balcony and overlook the children play in Timmermansparken. 

The situation in Sodermalm is very well, closed to Comuter train station (direct for going to Tometits with the kids), subway and many buses, clodes too supermarket, Café Hôtel Rival, etc... 

Karin is very nice person, helpfull, understanding (I've need her help at many time),"

Es ist eine recht stylische Wohnung mit einem zwar kleinen, aber recht gemütlichen Gästezimmer. Das Bad ist direkt gegenüber und wie das Zimmer sehr sauber.
Andy hat mich auf der Straße vor dem Haus begrüßt. Er und seine Frau sind sehr sympathisch und hilfsbereit. Ich kann diese Unterkunft ohne Bedenken weiterempfehlen!"

565912,306058009,2018-08-12T00:00:00.000Z,Patrik and his family were perfect hosts. They offered everything to make our stay enjoyable. The house is stylish cozy and very well equipped. Even our grandchildren who live in Stockholm and came to see us quite often loved the place. It is situated on a small hill with a beautiful garden and wonderful view to the water. We would like to come again.
357012,85415498,2016-07-11T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a wonderful three days at Calles place in Stockholm. Was even more beautiful in person. Calles wife was there to greet us and explain all the specifics we needed about the apartment. And a lovely bottle of wine as a welcoming gift -- unexpected and very appreciated. The apartment has wonderful light and very relaxing. Close to a small park area (5 minutes walking) with great views of the City Hall and Old Town. The metro station is less than 10 minutes walk. Everything worked as described. 

We were a family of three (two adults and one child) and the place was a perfect size to have both group and alone time. 

Some things to remember:

1. Elevator is small -- 3 people max without luggage
2. Stove is amazingly fast to heat water or make coffee -- just get a quick lesson on the operation
3. Washer and dryer worked great -- if you can't read Swedish, you might need to look up the instructions on the Internet

Thanks again Calle, would stay there again on another trip to Stockholm!"
164448,78074278,2016-06-05T00:00:00.000Z,Lidia was extremely friendly and gave us lots of great advice about transport and activities around Stockholm.

It's amazing!"

278311,524591795,2019-09-06T00:00:00.000Z,When going to Stockholm look no further than Farsta. Honestly the area is (Website hidden by Airbnb) has a daily thriving colourful fruit and veg market encompassed by one big mall. You could easily lose yourself for half a day. It also has great transport links whether you want to head in town or out of town. The other side of Farsta boasts a beautiful park that sits on the edge of a huge lake. The cafe sells mouthwatering cakes. But the piece d resistance has to be the family we stayed with who were top notch hosts that were extremely helpful  with directions and places to see. You felt more like you were doing a homestay rather than Airbnb. Linnea lives in a lovely area and we would certainly come back for more
442837,7954841,2013-10-09T00:00:00.000Z,Jo's place was in a great area- easy public transport connections and pleasant walks close by. The bedroom and all amenities were nice and clean

900043,158315274,2017-06-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Kleines Appartment an einer Hauptverkehrsstraße gelegen, die Betten bestehen aus Matratzen, Kommunikation mit der Gastgeberin war unkompliziert und freundlich. Die Fotos gegen genau wieder, wie es im Appartment aussieht, leider hat die Küche und das Badezimmer kein Fenster oder Lüftungsmöglichkeit und die Sauberkeit lies zu wünschen übrig. Die Anbindung an die Stadt ist per U-Bahn sehr gut, zu Fuß dauert es ca. 20 Minuten."
438129,15975250,2014-07-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Bon endroit ! The house is Exceptionally clean and tidy at all times. Eva and Douglas are very nice people : they made room for me in the fridge, in the kitchen, in the bathroom... Eva is always smiling and she's a Very thoughtful host. As she had time when I arrived, she picked me and my heavy luggage up from the metro, which I'm very grateful for ! She also spoke Swedish to me, as she knew I was taking a course in the language. I would definitely recommend this room, unless you're very tall, because you might bang your head quite a lot, and unless you're claustrophobic, as the room as no windows ( but it has fans). As there's is a small child in the family, it's also better if you don't need silence all the time (but frankly, I slept well).
For the price of a youth hostel, you get your own room with a desk, internet, cleanliness, access to a kitchen, fresh towels... There's also an ICA grocery store on the way to the metro. Very convenient !"
610034,5190646,2013-06-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Overall, a great experience!

1. CLEAN AND COMFORTABLE - Comfortable, clean and actually a very nicely decorated apartment with fun details and thoughtful design! I nearly fell in love with the couch, which is even more comfortable than the one I have at home.  The bathroom looks newly renovated, with a fantastic rainforest shower head that made my day (and yes, with perfect water pressure)! The loft bed is a twin-sized bed and comfortable, but could be a bit snug for taller individuals.

2. LOCATION - Only a short 8-9 minute walk to the Stanskull train station, from which you can get to almost anywhere easily and quickly.  There's also a city bike rack nearby (on the way to train station as well), so that is an option for getting around the city as well.  There's a great little bakery on the way to the train station and a great place to get breakfast (Wallins), or else a grocery store right around the corner for anything you might need.

3. GREAT HOSTESS - Ida (pronounced, \"Ee-da\") was fantastic with providing information on helping us get to the city, and able to accommodate our arrival and departure times.  Very friendly and gracious, thank you, Ida!"
1204621,332434427,2018-10-05T00:00:00.000Z,A beautiful apartment and the cleanest airbnb I have ever seen. 10/10
164448,171206611,2017-07-17T00:00:00.000Z,"From the very start, my communication with with Li was excellent: she answered quickly and in a very welcoming and pleasant way.



Before I arrived, she provided me with clear and accurate instructions how to reach her flat in three different ways - the quickest, the normal and the cheapest including buying a multi-day ticket for all the public transport in Stockholm.
I recommend buying that ticket as you can also use it for getting from and to the airport.



When I arrived, Li welcomed me and offered me a coffee. She was cordial and provide me with maps and a wide selection of explanations and recommendations for the city, museum, interesting places and transport to and from her place.

Location is very good. 5 min walk to J train to the airport, 10 min walk to 2 different Metro stops and busses. Many supermarkets around as well as coffee shops, bars and restaurants.

The room is on the second floor, which guarantees complete privacy. Li rents two rooms on that floor. Luckily for me, I was the only guest so I enjoyed a double room and a private toilet and shower.

The apartment is perfectly clean, and Li provides all the necessary things, such as a microwave, fridge, kettle, instant coffee and milk. The apartment has all the utensils and crockery to prepare a simple meal in the microwave. The room is small but has enough space for what you need with many electrical sockets. Very comfortable bed.

Li was a great host, a pleasant conversationalist if you want, but respects your privacy if you want to be alone.

I really enjoyed being in Li's flat and meeting her. She also change old banknotes for new ones when she understood that the bank would only replace notes that were out of circulation only for bank account holders.

Recommended with all my heart!"

278311,294007143,2018-07-21T00:00:00.000Z,I had Linnea's place to myself as she was staying somewhere else during my visit. The apartment is a good size and within about a 7 minute walk to the metro station. It takes about an hour to get into the main city of Stockholm (but there were train upgrades happening which made it a little slower). Linnea purchased some breakfast food for me to prepare in the mornings which was a nice perk. I would stay here again if visiting Stockholm another time.

The view is beautiful and the location is central.  The apartment is decorated nicely, has plants lining the window, is very clean, and comfortable.  I definitely recommend both Sibelle as a host and her apartment as a great stay."

608672,108947711,2016-10-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Karl is such a lovely host and an excellent communicator who would go out of his way to help you, the location of the room is second to none and we couldn't have found a better spot, we needed an iron and Karl was great in providing us with one asap. my only comments would be the size of the room and the bathroom.

The room is small so if you are traveling with someone you don't know well then it's not the one for you. It's a small room and not a studio which makes it cosy.

The toilet is very small and doesn't have a shower space, there is a metal provider which you can use to limit the water going everywhere but sadly it's not the most efficient and you still end up with a very wet toilet floor which you would need to sweep using a small hand sweeper which means you have to bend to sweep the floor which was difficult for me as I have a bad back. 

The building is an amazing building from 1930s I believe but this means that the drains are not the best which translated into our room constantly smelling badly from the toilet drains."
647314,272195701,2018-06-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Mallika’s place is everything you would want. Located in a beautiful neighborhood, right next to the subway, with places to indulge and eat very well! Nothing like grabbing a pastry from Bageri Petrus, and sitting at the park all 5 mins from the place. 

The unit itself is impeccably designed, so memorable and cute. You won’t want to leave the living space! Mallika was kind, and easy to communicate with. 

Please do stay here if you got the chance, will make your stockholm stay just a little more special!"

Two nearby grocery stores, sushi/Thai place across the street. Safe quiet neighbourhood with excellent access to DT and Lidingö. Terry met us at the apartment even though we came in at 2am and he had stocked the fridge with bare necessities AND made us some authentic Swedish toasted cheese sandwiches. He answered and helped with many pre-trip details and was a wonderful unobtrusive yet supportive host while we were there."

When I tried to ask a question during my check-in, her response was that she doesn't speak English. This could be a problem if you have questions or need help in English."

If you want to live like a local in Stockholm, you’ve hit the jackpot with their stylish Scandi home. We traveled as a family of four and it set us up perfectly for the most memorable stay in Stockholm. We couldn’t have had a better stay."

1248490,13131350,2014-05-20T00:00:00.000Z,We had a great stay in Maria's apartment! It was very comfortable and well decorated with a nice view on a typical church! The neighborhood was nice with a good Indian restaurant right at the corner of the street and a couple of interesting shops (music and design). Very flexible on the departing time from the flat.

My parents only speak Spanish and they had no problems talking to Margareta, since she also speaks some Spanish.

The location looks far at first, but getting there is quite easy and straightforward. The balcony has a nice view, full of green and nature."
1153177,15574364,2014-07-12T00:00:00.000Z,"My family and I stayed at Terry's apartment for 6 days, and it worked out perfectly! The apartment was plenty spacious and comfortable for 5 adults, and located in a great area of the city - close enough to walk to the tourist attractions, but remote enough that it was calm and quiet.

Terry was a great host - he welcomed my family with a home-cooked breakfast when we arrived, and answered all of our questions throughout the week. Even when the washing machine broke unexpecedly, he came over and finished and folded our laundry before taking the machine way for repairs. He was charming and conversational with my family, and even broke out his guitar and sang us a couple songs before we left!

Would definitely recommend Terry and this apartment to anybody looking for a great place to stay in Stockholm. Thanks Terry!"

862868,64197376,2016-03-01T00:00:00.000Z,"I stayed in Pernilla's apartment for one month, while in Stockholm for work. Prior to arrival, Pernilla was easy to communicate with and quick to respond. My arrival date was a few days before she was scheduled to leave but she accommodated my stay anyway so I could come straight to the apartment from the airport, which was very helpful so I did not have to find a second place for those few days. 
Upon arrival she showed me around the apartment and the building, suggested some highlights of the neighborhood, and let me know she had left some breakfast food and tea in the kitchen to get me started. However, even if she had not been there to show me around, there were detailed written instructions left on the counter.
The apartment itself was perfect for me. It is ideal for one person with everything needed for a long stay like mine. The kitchen is equipped with dishes, pots/pans, utensils, etc. and has a dishwasher but no microwave, so food must be heated in the oven. Everything worked properly and was easy to use.  The apartment is setup in a functional way so that, even if it appears small at first, all the spaces are utilized well giving the sense of a larger apartment. Also, there was space cleared in the closet and bathroom so I could store my things.
The building has an elevator, however, the apartment is on the top floor and the elevator arrives one floor below with stairs that lead to the apartment one flight up. This was not a problem for me, but maybe good to know if you have a lot of luggage or trouble with stairs. I also did not have problems scheduling and using the laundry room which is in another building. 
The location was also perfect. It is directly across the street from a metro entrance, only one stop from Stockholm Central Station where it is possible to transfer to any other train line. There is also a full grocery store on the same block that is open late and very convenient. Although there are shops, restaurants, banks, etc. nearby, the apartment is not too far from the waterfront where there is a trail for walking along the water (and Stockholm is beautiful any time of year)."

She was waiting for us at the apartment when we arrived and gave us good tips to move around. Before we arrived and during our stay, Emma was very responsive to our emails, answering within minutes if not seconds. Amazing! The apartment is located in a very nice area. It has a perfect size and orientation. You will fall in love with its small terrace from where to enjoy the sun in the morning while having a cup of coffee. The apartment was very clean and Emma bought some \"welcome food\" for us. I strongly recommend this place to everyone looking for a great place to stay to visit the beautiful city of Stockholm."

We took advantage of this by making breakfast and several dinners in his kitchen to cut down on our expenses.  He provided us access to his wireless internet, clean towels and sheets, and general tips about museums and sites to visit.  The location is perfect as there is a grocery story and mall underneath his apartment, plus a metro stop accessible from the mall, which runs on the main red line.

It is one minute from the Slussen  hub subway station, near the city center, yet removed from most of the tourist crowd. This comfortable, clean apartment in a historic scenic area of Södermalm;  with friendly, helpful hosts deserves the highest rating."
1184553,289825216,2018-07-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Her place was great (minus no A/C or fan) and in an amazing location, but Annbritt herself was slightly disappointing. From the moment we arrived, she was pretty short with us and borderline rude (even about simple questions). Instructions were given and things marked around the house as if a toddler were to stay there, and we never felt truly welcome. 

Her place is nice and accurate as advertised and still in an amazing location."

The apartment is spottlessly clean, contain everything you need - well-equipped kitchen and bathroom, cosy living and small bedroom - much more space and comfort than a room in hotel. The location is rather good - we walked every day along two beautiful embankments  - so romantic! We will definitly return to Stockholm and stay in Annika's place again

There was free parking on the weekends on the street outside and after we'd gotten settled, Gabriella sent us through heaps of great advice about the area.

There was heaps of great food close by, as well as a subway station and the walk to Gamla Stan wasn't long (actually really nice!).

We would definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone :)"

916806,40554966,2015-08-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Mansour und Julia waren leider selbst im Urlaub, so dass wir sie nicht persönlich getroffen haben. Der Kontakt war im Vorfeld aber sehr gut und auch während unseres Aufenthalts haben wir bei Nachfragen schnelle eine Antwort bekommen. In der Wohnung sind alle notwendigen Informationen hinterlassen.
Die Wohnung selbst ist sauber und für einen Kurzaufenthalt gut ausgestattet. Zu Bus- und U-Bahn-Haltestellen ist es nicht weit. Große Shopping-Malls erreicht man mit dem Auto innerhalb von 10 Minuten.
Kleine Kritikpunkte: Die Jalousien reichen nicht aus, um die Wohnung nachts komplett abzudunkeln. 
Die Pumpe ist sehr laut. Man hört sie immer wenn Wasser abgelassen wird, auch wenn die Nachbarn in der oberen Etage Waser laufen lassen. Nachts ist es besonders nervig.
Die Bewohner in der Wohnung drüber waren ab dem frühen Abend sehr laut (Trampeln, Musik). Dies war fast täglich bis ca. 23 Uhr Standard. 
Ansonsten ist die Wohnung weiterzuempfehlen und für 2-5 Tage würden wir sie wieder buchen."

1255668,48647650,2015-09-27T00:00:00.000Z,"We felt very pleased to be able to stay at Sandras place. Just some 20 mins drive with bus 1 from Stockholm Centralstation and located close to bus stop. Bringing our son we had a good time staying in the flat and we also enjoyed the small garden and the marvellous view to sea and sunsets in the living room.

Our best recommendation to Sandra."
700113,6575760,2013-08-17T00:00:00.000Z,Great cozy and quiet studio apartment located close to everything in Stockholm. Llona is a great host and was very helpful.

757320,147169573,2017-04-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Siamo stati da Barb durante il ponte del 25 aprile. La posizione è buona, a circa 10 minuti di passeggiata da Gamla Stan, l'isola centrale di Stoccolma. Metro a neanche 5 minuti. La stanza è calda ed accogliente, il bagno pulito, c'è una vasca doccia, un lavandino, niente bidet. Abbiamo solo dormito, non abbiamo fatto colazione o pasti da lei, quindi non sappiamo come si regoli. Palazzina tranquilla, Sesto piano con ascensore. Il costo puo' sembrare alto ma Stoccolma è molto molto costosa, quindi va messo in proporzione. Host e città consigliati (anche se è meglio andare d'estate, durante il nostro Soggiorno ha nevicato parecchio) ."

Thanks Coretta"

700113,469846673,2019-06-15T00:00:00.000Z,This cozy studio was perfect for me as a single traveler.  It had everything I needed.  The location is great for public transportation and for to/from the airport.  I appreciated the special welcome touches.
1182616,203457650,2017-10-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Peters place was very nice and well kept, the location was very comfortable and there were several things to do nearby! I would definitely stay here again"
1244357,7164743,2013-09-09T00:00:00.000Z,"The location is excellent! It's 1 block away from a Hard Rock Cafe, which should tell you something about it's location. Apartment is as described in the photos, very well organized and efficient, everything here is from IKEA. My mom and sister stayed here and Elliot was nice enough to get 2 new single mattresses for me to sleep on the floor with. This place could sleep up to 5 people (with two persons in the main bedroom), although I would say it would be too crowded to have over 4 people in this apartment.

It also has a nice 42\" flatscreen TV you can plug your laptop into. A note about the WIFI, Elliot took me immediately to a place where I got a USB 3G stick and it was pretty cheap, you get 5GB for about $14US, and the stick is another $14 or so."
822497,14774623,2014-06-26T00:00:00.000Z,"I stayed at Moa's apartment with a some of friends for a couple days and had nothing short of a pleasant experience.  The apartment itself was great, with all the amenities. Moa also went above and beyond, leaving detailed directions on places to go and checked in daily. I would definitely recommend staying here to anyone traveling to Stockholm. You'll most definitely enjoy your stay and you couldn't ask for a more gracious host."
954832,7107696,2013-09-06T00:00:00.000Z,"This was my first time using AirBnB, and Mikael made it a great experience.  I highly recommend this place.

My friend Anna and I stayed for 3 nights after deciding to extend our stay in Stockholm.  We had started out at the Courtyard Marriott so had used the subway line and knew we liked the area before we booked.

About the place:  Very clean and has everything you'd really need - kitchen, k-cup coffee maker, Bose speaker/iPhone charger.  There isn't a TV - but we really didn't care about that, and the internet is fast enough to watch things on-line if you have a laptop w/you and we used the Bose speaker for better-than-laptop sound.  The couch pulls out into a full bed (which is where I slept) - and I slept really well.  A nice plus is that the bathroom floor is heated - which was awesome in the mornings.  

It's on a quiet street, but very close to the subway (Fridhemsplan).  There are plenty of bars, restaurants, a shopping mall, and a couple of grocery stores as well.

Mikael is very responsive, easy to reach, and helpful if you have any questions or requests.  We both had our own set of keys to use and code for the gate/building.  Our only request after check-in was for a hairdryer, and he responded within minutes and had one ready to go."
556363,87138634,2016-07-18T00:00:00.000Z,We had a very pleasant stay at Lennard's flat! The location was perfect as it is close to the metro and the bus. We were comfortable as five people in the apartment but six could be tricky because the cot was unstable. The apartment is beautiful with a lot of light. We would recommend staying here for sure!
299154,22474623,2014-11-07T00:00:00.000Z,"The flat was exactly as described, good, clean and in very nice location. An added bonus was finding one of the best gastropubs in Stockholm just some 50 meters away, providing us (sort of ;) refreshing evening between busy business days. Tack ska du ha!"
723539,199137811,2017-10-01T00:00:00.000Z,"My husband and I traveled with our toddler for 4 nights and would best describe it as a sunny 1 bed flat in a great location (Ostermalm). 

If you're traveling more carefree it's a nice, quirky, plant-filled apartment in a location that is close to lots of things. Those traveling with children should note there isn't a microwave, or toaster and curtains are thin...but we were happily relieved when our daughter managed to go back to sleep after dawn! There is also an absolutely lovely playground only a 5-7 min walk at Humlegarden. 

We had a little hiccup with our check in as Mathias just started using Instant Book and our booking was done the day before, so we got Airbnb to help us, but pretty sure it was a one off as Mathias communicated well with us thereafter and even express posted the USB wifi stick he had forgot to leave at the flat.

Mathias seemed like a friendly guy when he popped around to pick up some items. Something we didn't realise when we booked is it's very much his home in that he lives there the majority of the time and his stuff is there. That meant we could use things like his olive oil etc. and not buy our own, which is great and get a little glimpse into the life of a Stockholm resident!"
278311,3156202,2012-12-25T00:00:00.000Z,Linnéa is a beautiful soul. Her home is very clean & comfortable. It is also quite close to public transport. I would stay with her again & I would recommend her place to you.

1189469,507922471,2019-08-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Alida's place is very cozy and unique.  It is in a perfect location in a wonderful neighborhood with restaurants, breakfast places, shops etc. close by.  Alida has great taste and we immediately felt home.  She left us a great bottle of Italian red wine, which we enjoyed a lot.  There is a master bedroom with a big double bed and a french size bed in the daughter's bedroom, which is a little small for 2 people, but manageable.  The check-in/check-out was super easy and Alida replied super quickly to our questions.  This place is not an \"only\" Airbnb place, but the family lives there and therefore you see a lot of personal items, food in the fridge and toys in the girl's room.  For us it was not a problem at all, but I just wanted to mention that.  We would definitely come back to beautiful Stockholm and would for sure book Alida's place again."

All the tips provided were the highlights of my trip.  Thanks again for the over the top attention to detail"
1212891,69163216,2016-04-09T00:00:00.000Z,"It was soooo nice to meet with Maud, her sweet home and her king leon cat! :) She was very kind, helpful, organized and absolutely professional for hosting. Her home was lovely! We stayed in the purple room. It was the sweetest and also the tidiest room we have ever stayed. And the candys that she gives as a gift was perfect! Even she has a cat the house were clean. Taking your shoes when you enter the home is also effective in this cleanliness. We stayed just one night but we would stay more. If we ever come to Stockholm again, we absolutely prefer Maud's home! :)"
242188,51081222,2015-10-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia kindly met me at the door (even though my arrival time was a moving target), and helped me with my luggage. What's more, after a long drive, she served me tea and dinner. I tried to return the favor with a cake from a local bakery, and we spent an evening in heartfelt discussion. I feel lucky to have stayed here, and the other guests were kind too."
610948,43490218,2015-08-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Lina is a great host and we had an amazing week in Stockholm. From the very beginning, Lina answered all messages quickly and she was always very nice and helpful. When we arrived, she also provided us with lots of helpful tipps what to do in Stockholm and gave us a map of the area around the apartment, where she had marked some interesting places for us. During our stay she got in touch with us again to find out if we needed anything else, which was also very nice. 
The apartment is exactly as described and as shown in the pictures and it is beautiful, stylish and cosy, all at the same time. There is enough space for two people and you have everything you need there. Besides, the apartment is in a very hip neighbourhood with lots of things to do and see nearby. The old town and the modern city centre are also very close and so it never took us long to get anywhere. 
All in all, I wouldn't hesitate to stay at such a great place again! :)"
1212891,45240864,2015-09-01T00:00:00.000Z,Perfect stay! Maud gave us a warm welcome and was always helpful and friendly. We liked the clean flat and the location of it. We would definetly recommend a stay here.
755843,100830323,2016-09-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Très bon accueil de Par, qui nous a donné de précieuses informations sur les endroits à visiter à Stockholm et les commerces entourant le logement ! L'appartement est bien situé, à pied on peut facilement accéder à tout Stockholm. Il est idéal pour 4 personnes et tout équipé, c'était parfait pour notre séjour.
Je recommande sans hésiter !"
1212891,476461474,2019-06-26T00:00:00.000Z,It is a really good accomodation and we can honestly recomend it. Maud is a very friendly host and you feel welcome from the first moment. The room was clean and cozy. The location is easy accessible in a good residential area and all in all perfect for a stay in Stockholm.
1124388,112438829,2016-11-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Awesome place. Everything is there, including a perfect selection of vinyl records and hundreds of books, a cozy bed for two, a nice couch and fully equipped kitchen.
The apartment itself is very well connected to the center by the bus (runs every 5 mins). The bus stop is just around the corner. 
Also there is a supermarket and a very nice pizza place nearby.
Carl is super helpful and friendly.
Highly recommended."
1035775,71929575,2016-04-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Magnus was a great host, he communicated well leading up to us arriving, was there to show us the key points of his flat, then gave us space while we were there.

His apartment was small but nice, but we did notice some issues between what we expected and what was actually there. The listing said the apartment had a washing machine, but there definitely wasn't one in the apartment. All I can think of for this is that there may be a laundry in the building that Magnus forgot to mention. The second thing that the bed is quite small, we had booked as a couple but no way could we both sleep comfortably on the one bed, so one of us had to sleep on the couch. Lastly, the pictures show a table and chairs on the balcony, but it was bare during our stay. It didn't overly bother us as it was so cold we wouldn't have used it anyway, but it was not as it is pictured on the listing."
776012,163281404,2017-06-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Majken's apartment was very lovely and comfortable, with a beautiful view of the city.  She was a great host and we'd highly recommend staying here."
1124388,517401714,2019-08-25T00:00:00.000Z,The apartment is as described. Nice and comfortable. We stayed in two people for four nights. The place is not far from the centre and in Stockholm the public transports are well organized. Carl was very nice and he gave us all the information and suggestions for our visit too. He was helpful for the check in (he waited for us at the bus station) as well for the time of check out (we had the flight in the afternoon). Absolutely recommended.
916806,125849806,2017-01-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Mansour's flat is well located in a very peaceful neighborhood, close to the nature, forests and lakes. We had a pleasant stay and had a good break in Sweden ! For those who want to go to Stockholm downtown, you have a direct line with the metro."
299154,12876347,2014-05-13T00:00:00.000Z,"My husband and I loved the location of Daniel's apartment in Sodermalm. It was cozy but had all of the essentials. We thoroughly enjoyed the balcony. The street traffic, mostly bicycles and foot traffic, was always interesting. Daniel's space heater made this a usable area in early May. Most sites we wanted to see were within walking distance or an easy ride on the subway, about 1 minute away. The water pressure was strong and there was never a shortage of hot water. On are arrival Daniel gave us very good information about the neighborhood, stores, restaurants etc. We were delighted to find a bottle of sparkling wine in the fridge to celebrate the first night of our delightful honeymoon in Stockholm.  The unit was priced right for the week and met our complete expectations. We would definitely recommend this unit and would happily return."
748847,100664780,2016-09-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Heath was awesome!  He gave very clear instructions on how to gain access to the apartment, utilize the appliances, and navigate around town.  Also, his recommendations for sights and experiences were superb.  We have a young family, so he went ahead and placed a high chair in the apartment and rebuilt an IKEA crib for our daughter.  The area ,Sodermalm, was one of the coolest, hippest, and safest places I'd ever been.  He and his apartment were super fantastic.  Definitely book this place for vacation and time with your family in one the most family friendly cities in the world.  Thanks for a great experience, Heath."
1182616,56522005,2015-12-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Peter was very friendly and helpful. He gave us full access to his apartment. Although he was not staying with us, we found no trouble at all. The location is quite central and very close to the train station."

Le balcon fleuri, qui donne sur une cour arborée, est un vrai plus pour Stockholm. Le quartier n'a pas beaucoup d'intérêt, mais le métro est proche et rapide pour se rendre au centre."
1262520,6753885,2013-08-24T00:00:00.000Z,Sima's place was a really nice place to stay in Stockholm. Located on kungsholmen in front of a nice park. Not far from subway (maybe 3mn by walk) bus...There is a lot of shops around to buy food. This studio apartment is a nice play to rest after walking through Stockholm because it's quiet during the night.
438129,156553009,2017-05-31T00:00:00.000Z,"I felt very confortable and really enjoyed my stay there.
Actually, I was treated as a part of the family. We had really interesting conversations along the time I was hosted with them. At the end, I would consider them as my new friends from Stockholm! 
I would completely recommend this family to share home, specially for students and open-minded people.
A lot of facilities were available in the house, which made my stay a nice experience!"

242188,56859347,2015-12-19T00:00:00.000Z,Lidia was a really nice host who is willing to give advices for visiting Stockholm. The room is single but really nice. The place is also easy to get to the down town and centre via public transport. I would definitely recommend Lidia for anyone who is planning to travel to Stockholm.

The walk to central station was a little longer than I had anticipated, but otherwise I was very happy with my stay."
1035775,12711287,2014-05-09T00:00:00.000Z,Our stay at Magnus place was fantastic. It is the perfect size for a couple of people to stay. The kitchen is small but very well equipped. There are a couple of grocery stores near by so we were able to make breakfasts and a nice meal in the apartment. His place is just about 10 minutes from the center of Stockholm which was fantastic since we had the Stockholm card during our stay. I would love to stay at his place again.
170651,79419650,2016-06-12T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment is in a great location - close to major transit but also very quiet! Great layout, perfect for 2-3 people. The kitchen is very well equipped with basics. The beds are comfortable. The space itself is tight, but works well for a few people. There is no seating, however - which was an issue when making a sit-down meal. The patio/balcony was a great place to sit and enjoy the sun! Very easy to communicate with Marie. Wifi was great (except we accidentally unplugged the router thing, and it eventually ran out of battery and we struggled to figure out how to get internet back!) The room does not have dark curtains; hopefully not an issue for others. Bathroom was a little tight, but doable - no shower curtain, which was odd. I would recommend this place to anyone! Also, the cat is very cute, cuddly/friendly!"

Både vi og barna er kjempe fornøyde med både leilighet og nærområde. Lekeplassen med plaskedam og strandområdene var fantastisk. Leiligheta var ren og klargjort til vi kom, og veldig behagelig og stilig innredet."

Nothing wrong to report, except that our travel was too short and that the weather was not shiny (in november (hahaha)).

Klara gave us the key in the main train station and sent us indications to find easily our place. Don't forget the shampoo ans something too eat in the morning (there is a teakettle, some tea and coffee you can buy it in the subway's shop)

Thanks a lot =)"

Situated at max. 2‘ from the next subways & buses and at max. 30‘ from the next store. It even has a nice little backyard. Communications with Sofie & Jesper was smooth and very fast. Definitely a treat for travellers that like interior-design & art."
438129,4890153,2013-05-31T00:00:00.000Z,"Ea is absolutely the best host. She has been so helpful to me in getting around Sweden, understanding different cultural aspects and giving me random tidbits of information to help make me stay more enjoyable. Her place is near the train station and it is very convenient to get into the center of Stockholm from there. The public transit in and around Stockholm is 1st class so you won't have any trouble getting where you are going. I can't recommend her more highly for your stay!"
1149820,187123643,2017-08-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Die Unterkunft ist liebevoll eingerichtet, hat alles was man braucht und die Lage ist ideal. Nur 5 Minuten von der Bus/U-Bahnstation entfernt. Der Kontakt mit Klara war sehr unkompliziert. Sie antwortete innert kürzester Zeit und war sehr flexibel beim Check-in. Wir können Klaras Studio wärmstens weiterempfehlen."

지하철역과 상당히 가까워서 교통이동이 매우 편리했고, 집근처에 맛있는 빵집과 음식점, 편의시설들이 많아서 좋았습니다.
숙소는 사진상 봤던 부분과 거의 유사했고, Mallika와 직접 만나지 못해 아쉬웠지만 대체적으로 물음에 늦게라도 성의있게 답변해 주었습니다.
쾌적하고 깨끗했으며, 간혹 주변소음이 있긴했지만,
편안하고 안락한, 아기자기한 숙소였습니다:)"

608672,477913179,2019-06-29T00:00:00.000Z,"I truly enjoyed my stay at Karl's studio flat. It's clean, quiet, cozy and located in an amazing place on Norrmalm. It is in a parallel street to Drottninggatan, the long street which runs through the center of Stockholm down to Old town. Considering how expensive Stockholm can be, the studio apartment provides great value for money. It most suitable for one or two people (either for business or leisure) who are in Stockholm for a shorter stay. It is not suitable for travelers who wish to cook their own food as their is no stove (there is however a microwave and a filter coffee maker). I would recommend it and be very happy to stay again."
954832,75077048,2016-05-18T00:00:00.000Z,"From our very first inquiry, Mikael was most a welcoming Host & at all times a very prompt, responsive & helpful communicator.   The apartment description & photos were exactly as represented on the 'airbnb' website. A spotlessly clean, quiet, cosy, well maintained, well lit, bright & airy apartment with all necessary facilities for an extremely comfortable & enjoyable stay.  The apartment is located in a lovely neighbourhood (Kungsholmen) & so close to shops, supermarkets, post office, transport, restaurants etc. + central Stockholm. It is less than 5 minutes walk to the nearest Metro/Tunnelbarna stop (Fridhemsplan) & this stop was only 2 stops from 'Stockholm Central'.  Several bus routes also in close proximity. The apartment is set in an apartment block that was extremely quiet & secure -  the communal areas (i.e. stairs/lift/lobby entrance etc.) were very clean & well maintained also, including the large private, inviting courtyard area for residents.  Entry security excellent both to the apartment  & the apartment block.  Michael lives in the adjacent apartment & is therefore promptly available should anything be required etc. (which in our case, wasn't). The bath towels Mikael provided were the best we've experienced in any 'airbnb' establishment so far...water pressure both in the kitchen & bathroom was really good with immediate & abundant hot water.  Overall lighting throughout the apartment also very good indeed + heating very effective & cosy.  The 'gallery' kitchen was small but well equiped & functional for basic meals - bed very comfortable & great internet. My husband & I were very impressed that the apartment also contained 'safety' items  being a First Aid Kit / Fire Extinguisher / Fire Blanket.  Mikael also supplied a wealth of local sight-seeing pamphlets/brochures/maps etc. & an extremely helpful 'Welcome Package' Folder containing  detailed information relating to the apartment that Mikael also emailed to us well prior to our arrival - this was much appreciated.  Michael is indeed a great Host - we would not consider staying anywhere else on a return visit to Stockholm & would highly recommend to friends/family."
581243,12740168,2014-05-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Пребывание в доме Эдвина стало для меня комфортным и приятным, несмотря на неработающую ванную комнату.  Хозяин  постарался минимизировать все неудобства связанные с этим. 
Квартира поражает чистотой. В моем распоряжении была большая комната , балкон, компьютер (ноутбук), фен, хорошо оснащенная кухня. Месторасположение отличное, вблизи многих достопримечательностей. Рядом находятся остановки автобусов и станция метро. 
Особенное удобство заключается в том, что внизу находится уютный торговый центр с многочисленными магазинами, супермаркетами, аптеками, парикмахерскими, кафе и прочее. 
Эдвин очень приятный в общении, отзывчивый и заботливый человек. Он помогал мне во всем ,в чем я нуждалась.И в  своих следующих поездках в Стокгольм я бы хотела останавливаться только здесь.
Staying in a house of Edwin became for me a comfortable and enjoyable, despite the broken bathroom. The owner tried to minimize the discommodity concerned with this.
The apartment amazes purity. I had a large room, balcony, computer (laptop), hair dryer, well-equipped kitchen. 
Location is great, close to many touristic attractions . There are local buses and the metro station. 
Special commodity  is that the apartment is located above the cozy shopping center with numerous shops, supermarkets, pharmacies, hairdressers, cafes and so on.
Edwin is very pleasant in dialogue, responsive and caring person. He helped me with everything what I needed.
I wish Edwin sooner finish repairing a bathroom and start taking guests.I would highly recommend to stay at Edwin."

875505,272878183,2018-06-04T00:00:00.000Z,Great place in a fun area. In the middle of town with easy access to everything you need. Our only complaint was that Electra was a bit late with check-in but she was great about communicating the situation! Thanks for the stay!
700113,160715491,2017-06-15T00:00:00.000Z,"It is very close to public transit (less than 10min walk to Odenplan metro station. 15min walk from nearest Flybussen station that goes to Arlanda Airport). Although the unit is located in a residential area, there are shops, restaurants, bakeries within walking distances. The unit was neat and clean and had a good workspace/Internet connection as well. It is definitely good value for money."

Her appartment is lovely, spacious and full of light, I felt at home straight away and felt comfortable in the guest room. Her place is located very well within Stockholm and the next underground station is just round the corner. Jo was also a very welcoming host, really easy going and uncomplicated to communicate with. I would very much recommend her place and would book it again for another visit to Stockholm."
533880,14297592,2014-06-16T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed with Jarl for a weekend, it was a quiet and cozy room. The breakfast was perfect: fruit, yogurt, meat, cheese, and bread were all available. I slept on the cot and it was surprisingly comfortable. Jarl was accommodating, and allowed us to drop off our luggage early so we could explore Stockholm during the day. The distance to the city is perfectly walkable, although Jarl allowed us to use his City bike card which was wonderful and saved us so much time!"

302496,7852374,2013-10-06T00:00:00.000Z,"We LOVED this apartment! We were four adults (Dad and three adult kids) and the place was huge, with wonderful enormous daylight windows and room after room after room! No privacy issues and comfortable couches for morning coffee and evening bottles of wine. Heated floor in the bathroom and a great functional kitchen.The location is equally great. Two blocks or less to everything: subway, restaurants, grocery, and a variety of interesting stores. 20 minutes to central station, the waterfront, museums, or nearly any other location in the city. Seta was gracious (she dropped by mid-week to meet us) as was her son, Christopher, who met me and gave me the tour the first day. We could not have had a better first visit to Stockholm and we hope Seta's place is available for our next trip!"

Thank you, Nic & Usha!"
1261445,95071292,2016-08-18T00:00:00.000Z,Großartiges Appartement mit direktem Blick in den Högalidspark. Marie-Louise hat uns trotz sehr später nächtlicher Ankunft gemeinsam mit ihrer Tochter empfangen und noch einige gute Tips zu Stockholm allgemein bzw. bzgl. der direkten Nachbarschaft gegeben. Wir fanden einen gefüllten Kühlschrank vor und haben uns auch sonst sofort zuhause gefühlt. Fazit: eine lohnende Adresse für einen Stockholmtrip auch trotz des etwas höheren Preises.

The district in which the apartment is located is very quiet too. The apartment has everything you need, it has three bedrooms with comfortable beds, we really felt well in this place and would like to come back there if we had to visit Stockholm again. Stockholm is a city which is really worth visiting it. Thanks toTerry who was a very friendly and helpful host."

The flat is very quiet, well-equiped and the bedding is great. Thanks to the weather we could have breakfast in the patio all the week. It's short distance from the railway station and it takes only 3 stops to join the city center (10 mn). All contributed to a great stay in stockholm which is an amazing city !

442837,3407426,2013-01-24T00:00:00.000Z,This is my second time at this place. The standards are good and neighbourhood is one of the city's most vibrant part. Close a shoping mall and a communcation hub. You can easily travel to the heart to the city and even to the university campus. Jo and her mother were friendly and I did everything to make things easy for me during my staying. I recommend this place.

Ved ankomst: Vores fly fra Danmark var meget forsinket - og Maria var hjælpsom og meget forstående i denne forbindelse. Lejligheden: En særdeles flot og ren lejlighed - her mangler intet. Heller ikke ro eller lys! Området: Lejligheden ligger lige midt i skønne Södermalm  - og ikke mindst 5 etager over god indisk restaurant. Jeg kan kun anbefale Maria , som værtinde i denne lejlighed!"

We totally fell in love with it! Even went to planett and bolia where we could find some of the furniture *g*. The location is excellent, situated right in the middle so that Östermalm, Gamla Stan and Södermalm are easily reachable by feet or by tube. Sofie's mum took over the instructions about how to get in and was really helpful the whole stay - thanks for that, Monika. Really appreciated.

Would definitetly look into staying here again the next time I am in Stockholm.

Foi muito simpático ao deixar um ovo de Páscoa no apartamento no dia em que chegamos.
Neste dia, à noite, nos fez uma visita e deu algumas dicas sobre pontos turísticos em Estocolmo.
Apesar do apartamento estar um pouco afastado dos pontos turísticos, o transporte ônibus + metro funciona muito bem.
Não achamos que seja vantajoso pagar mais caro para ficar mais próximo desses locais.
Recomendamos a estadia no apartamento do Carl.
Ivan e família."

There's a great little kitchen (ideal for making your own evening meals) and the apartment just had a lovely atmosphere that made us feel at home straight away.  Great location too - it was only 15-20 minutes to get into the city centre by bus or you could take a wonderful walk along the southern edge of Kungsholmen island past parks, boat clubs and get to the Stadshus in about 45 minutes.  We'd recommend it to anyone going to Stockholm!"

It is a beautiful apartment, full of light, minimalistic, clean, and with everything you could need ranging from kitchen amenities to washing machine. Located in the heart of Birkastan, a neighborhood that is charismatic and vibrating with life, although peaceful, safe and quiet during the night. Fredric was super responsive throughout the whole stay and I could not recommend this place more. Genuinely special."
1158893,448424063,2019-05-05T00:00:00.000Z,Dany was a super helpful and attentive host. He provided us with lots of information and tips and responded quickly to all my messages. The house is lovely and comfortably fit our group - they thoughtfully left us snacks and things for breakfast. It’s in a quiet location and you can reach central Stockholm in about half an hour. Would highly recommend for larger groups.
1124388,103716140,2016-09-24T00:00:00.000Z,Carl showed me around his space to let me know where anything I might need was located. He gave me his number and let me know he could be reached any time if I had any issues.
1182616,8096927,2013-10-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Peter was very professional, and the room was large and comfortable. He wasn't there when we arrived, but his friend Marcus (who speaks far better English than he gives himself credit for!) was there to help us out and show us the ropes. The room we stayed in has a great enclosed balcony that I loved hanging out on. There are multiple rooms sharing one toilet and bath (I think 3, but it might only be 2), which could get dicey, but we only had to wait once to use it. Though the apartment is not in the middle of most touristy things, it’s within walking distance from Central Station if you don’t mind a bit of a walk and, if you do, there’s a T-bane stop within a couple blocks. The neighborhood is quiet and has several options for reasonably priced food, which is nice in an expensive city!

My favorite parts about staying with Peter…
* Great value
* Peter is very professional with great communication
* Large, comfortable room with a nice balcony

Perfect place for…
* Travelers looking for a great value in Stockholm."

1054406,280487400,2018-06-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Мы останавливались у Томаса на неделю с двумя детьми. Нам все очень понравилось, начиная с того как нас встретили - Томас разрешил нам приехать раньше времени, указанного на сайте, купил нам немного еды, чтобы мы могли перекусить с дороги, все рассказал и показал все самые необходимые вещи  - где находится автобусная остановка, магазин, кафе, более того Томас отвез нас в магазин на своей машине и мы смогли купить на неделю еды. Для младшего сына (2 года) Томас принес нам детский стульчик, игрушки и мячик, показал нам своих кроликов и разрешил их кормить, чему был очень рад мой сынишка.
Сам апартамент отличный, просторный и уютный. Расположен в 5 минутах до автобусной остановки. До центра можно легко добраться 5 остановок на автобусе и еще 10 остановок на метро по прямой.
Думали перед приездом, что возможно нужно будет пользоваться такси, однако городской транспорт очень удобен, так что даже не воспользовались!
Место чудесное, потому что живешь в городе Стокгольме, но в доме и ощущение, что находишься далеко от города! Место тихое, спокойное и красивое. Рядом большое озеро.
Рекомендую!!!"

The bed is a large king size and the room very quiet.  We slept wonderfuly well... however, the best part is Lidia herself.  She is kind, helpful, and had a wonderful breakfast for us each day as well as guides of the city and advice on what to see with the time we had allowed. 
If I were ever to go back to Stockholm, I would not consider staying elsewhere!"

Il nous a transmis les indications pour arriver jusqu'à l'appartement et son accueil a été chaleureux ! L'emplacement était à 2' à pied de note formation,  un luxe inestimable.  Le quartier est superbe. Nous aurions juste aimé pouvoir rendre l'appartement après l'heure du déjeuner. .. mais nous ne l'avons pas précisé à la réservation."

Mon amie et moi vous recommandons chaudement cet appartement pour sa situation géographique (à 20 min de la gare centrale en bus, arrêt du bus et magasin à proximité ouvert de 8h à 22h, endroit calme avec nature aux alentours).  Notre hôte Carl s'est montré discret, mais très sympathique et efficace.

My gf and I had a great experience in Stockholm, thanks to Carl. 

When we first got in touch with him, he replied very quickly and gave us the informations we needed. He sent us some others details about the easiest way to get there (maps, bus line...) few days before we went to Sweden. We were a bit late, but he was kind enough to wait for us and explained us different things about his appartment. Carl let at disposal in many languages brochures about Stockholm and maps.

Actually, it is all as indicated in the description he has made on this website. Good appt, great location (bus stop to central station, a convenient store open from 8.00 am to 10.00 pm, quiet place, nature...).

To sum it up : +++++

We both really enjoyed our stay in Stockholm and recommand you this great place whose host is great as well.

608672,280889354,2018-06-24T00:00:00.000Z,"The appartement is in a perfect location for enjoying the classic tourist program in Stockholm. We managed to see nearly all in a walking distance. 
It‘s very quiet although, because it‘s just around the corner of the main streets and the window‘s go to the backyard.
The appartement it self is not big, but just perfect for a city trip. 
There‘s everything you could need for your stay in Stockholm (even a small kitchen area).
Karl is a great host, wrote back quick and had at the beginning great tipps for our stay in this amazing city.
Really can recommend this appartement if you wanna be close to the main part of Stockholm."
299154,56250428,2015-12-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Daniel received me in a very friendly way and gave me the key earlier than agreed. His apartment is nice and cosy situated in quite a central way in Stockholm, next to a shopping street with nice boutiques. The room is small, but good enough for me as a business traveller that just wanted to have a bed to sleep on and an internet connection to do some work. I would definitely come back!"

723539,4037883,2013-04-04T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a great stay in Mathias' gorgeous flat in the heart of Stockholm. There was a super nice flow in the appartement and it really worked well for our little family. The kitchen got tested! And it could match my demands for every meal! This was the most important part for us, but we also enjoyed all the other bonuses as of the central location, not having to even move our car nor use public transport and still our days were filled with marvels! We found the inside market \"Östermalms Saluhall\" and the nearby health food stores which made us very happy. One afternoon was spent in the old town \"Gamla Stan\" and another at \"Djurgården\" and \"Junibacken\". Other super bonuses were the bathtub, the tidiness and the big balcony. The rest you can find out if you get a chance to rent Mathias' zen haven. He's a great host and we communicated easily from the start, check in- and out- times were customized to our needs and his possibilities, which is very generous! It felt so great to have a private home away from home while traveling and this is the best way I've been to Stockholm ever!  Thank you Mathias' and Airbnb"

Really appreciate that Carl accept us!
He is really kind to tell us that we can drink the milk in the fridge and use anything in the room if we need .
The room is very very clear, and bright.
The transportation is very convenient No 1 bus can get you to almost all the place you want!

If I have chance go back to Stockholm, I will definitely live in Carl's apartment !

The flat is an adorable bungalow on the outskirts of Stockholm city. Just a 10 min metro ride from the centre of the action, it's a great place to stay if you want the Stockholm experience with relaxing retreat to go home to. thanks V!"

The flat was exactly as published and in excellent conditions. We had everything we needed.
The location is also quite close to the touristic center and just next to the event we where attending to. The location for us was 11/10 

So.. I Would totally recommend this flat, both for the flat itself and for the host, which sometimes in airbnb is even more important."

The apartment has a great location, there are shops, restaurants and has great access to any part of the city. The apartment had everything that you could possibly need.

Grundsätzlich sehr empfehlenswert!"

533880,1853193,2012-07-31T00:00:00.000Z,"Our stay was great. Jarl provided us with fresh bread and breakfast each day, offered us lovely International beers from his own fridge and even got us some typical Swedish buns for our journey home! The sauna was a nice way to relax after a busy day of sightseeing.
The apartment is in a good location for walking into the centre and there's a 7-Eleven at the end of the street for bits and pieces.
Thanks Jarl!"
1244657,103981235,2016-09-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Nic & Usha are wonderful people and welcoming hosts. I wouldn't dream of staying elsewhere if my travels take me to Stockholm again. As advertised, the bed is very comfortable- esp. after a long journey. The shared bathroom is clean, hot shower, etc. The location can't be beat (just over the walking bridge from Gamla Stan/Old Town in Sodermalm). 

Perfect for a single traveler and made my stay in Stockholm so enjoyable. 
Thanks again, Nic and Usha, and may our paths cross again!"
299154,22425613,2014-11-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Daniels studio is located in a very central part of stockholm which is an easy 2 minute walk to the metro.  Gamla Stan is within an easy 5 minute walk over the bridge and plenty of good shopping and restaurants are nearby.

Daniel was a good host and was easy to communicate with.  He was flexible with check in and check out times and answered any questions we had via email promptly during our stay.

Daniels studio is cosy but very comfortable.  We would definitely stay again."

164448,76246404,2016-05-25T00:00:00.000Z,Located in a great part of town with easy access to all types of public transportation. Lidia took the time to sit down with us over coffee to give us recommendations on what to see during our trip. She went out of her way to help us do some much needed laundry as well. There were other guests staying that were fun to interact with. Highly recommended.
858902,41872332,2015-08-09T00:00:00.000Z,All great! I arrived in the middle of the night and Lotta still welcomed me in a friendly way.
620848,2420634,2012-09-26T00:00:00.000Z,"I had a great time staying in Stockholm with this apartment as my base.  The property is close to the train station so was easy to travel into the city (about 15 minutes to Central Station).  The rooms were well furnished and comfortable, and there were lots of spare bedding and towels.  There was a good-sized TV and I believe there is equipment on the patio for a barbecue (sadly not tried).  The bathroom had a fantastic shower.  The kitchen was very well equipped and had a big fridge freezer (although I was very lazy and did not cook for myself during my stay).  In particular I thought Hanna was really easy to communicate with and very helpful, and she had obviously given thought to her guests being comfortable. I would happily recommend this apartment, and go back myself next time I am in Stockholm."
1212891,10714496,2014-03-04T00:00:00.000Z,We are Andreea and Ian from England and we visited Maud in Stockholm for 3days! She was very welcoming and in an excellent location to access the city! She was very good value too. We thought she was a very good host and hope to come back in the summer!
1231897,78670587,2016-06-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Staying at Alexander's was terrific. I was supposed to stay at a hostel in Skarpnäck but the place was strange and uncomfortable (don't stay there!) and I was desperate to find a place completely last minute. Alexander got back to immediately and accepted my booking request. His place was in a much better part of town, it was a nice apartment with a large private room. Plus, Alexander is a terrific host. Super nice guy and very accommodating. We had great weather and so we went shopping for groceries and had a cookout. We hung out and watched a movie, so enjoying yourself in Stockholm can be where you stay. It was a great way to spend my last 5 days in Sweden. 

In a few minutes, you can be at a supermarket and the metro, and in less than 20 minutes, you'll be in the city center. I can't recommend Alexander highly enough. I'd definitely stay there again the next time I'm in Sweden."
757320,109210334,2016-10-20T00:00:00.000Z,"You really couldn't ask for a better location- a lovely 20 minute walk to the cute (but more touristy!) old town in Gamla Stan...but close to nice shops, cafes, and grocery stores if you don't feel like venturing too far. The room is cozy and clean, nice old-fashioned decor, and a big bathroom. Barb was super kind- she gave us our space, but we had a great conversations too about our cultures and she even made us tasty beet soup one night :)"
916806,17675144,2014-08-16T00:00:00.000Z,Nous avons été très bien accueillis par Mansour. La vue vers le lac Mälaren est magnifique depuis la terrasse. Le studio était parfait pour nous deux et nos deux enfants (8 et 10 ans). Le métro est à 10 minutes à pied (il faut compter 25 minutes de métro pour rejoindre le centre-ville). On peut également profiter de la forêt et d'une plage au bord du lac. Petites améliorations à apporter au niveau du confort du studio mais nous avons passé un très bon séjour.
757320,427199646,2019-03-23T00:00:00.000Z,The host canceled this reservation 8 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

The rest of the apartment was also beautiful, clean and the location was more than perfect. Just on one corner of Medborgarplatsen, one of the hot spots of the city, full of bars and shops, with a metro station in 2 minutes walking.
Annbritt is easy to communicate with and she was very kind and offered us help to go around the city or whatever other thing we could need during our stay.
I would massively recommend this place if you are planning to visit Stockholm for some days!"
1124388,400231690,2019-01-11T00:00:00.000Z,Carl's place was lovely and cosy in a great location for exploring Stockholm. I would definitely recommend to other travelers!!

Not only was the house perfect for our party of 6 but Jacob went out of his way to make the entire experience EXCELLENT!  The house was clean, warm, comfortable and close to the train so easy to get to downtown. He had breakfast for the first day in the house for us and dropped off umbrellas, coffee and a pastry on the second day.  Totally worth being outside of the Sentrum for the lovely Swedish hospitality!  Highly recommended!"
1212891,83888543,2016-07-04T00:00:00.000Z,Everything has been perfect in our stay in Stockholm and Maud has been always kind and helpful. It has been really a pleasure to spend some days in her apartment! We would certainly contact her again if we will come back in the future! We loved the welcoming of her cats :) Five stars!

1153177,34769736,2015-06-12T00:00:00.000Z,"公寓地段非常好,距离最近的地铁站步行五分钟,去City Hall两站地铁,去Galma Stan三站地铁,去Vasa Museum可以坐公交车,或者以上景点都可以步行,20~30分钟均可到达｡公寓所在小区环境优美有草坪喷泉,距离小型超市只需步行5分钟｡
公寓在5楼,有电梯,干净整洁,有两个阳台,天气好的话都能晒到太阳,有个设施齐全的厨房,可以自己做早饭｡房东Terry很热情,我们出发前他就帮忙预订好了接机的出租车,还为我们准备了披萨､小食和饮料｡而且terry对于所有信息回复速度都很快｡我们这些天住下来感觉非常方便,比住酒店温馨多了,非常棒的经历｡
The apartment is clean, warm and well located, very close to market and subway station. Most of those famous scenic spots are within 30-minute's walk. The neighbourhood is quiet and beautiful.
Terry is a great host and very responsive with messages. The apartment has a well-equipped kitchen and two lovely balconies. It was a great stay here."
581243,4236904,2013-04-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin has provided a great hospitality, friendliness, but also recommended places to visit by priority, due to our limited amount of time availability. 
The apartment and room itself are very clean, well located and reasonably priced.
Would recommend without hesitation :)"
1170766,362835070,2018-12-27T00:00:00.000Z,"We loved our stay at Annika's studio! We spent 4 nights there and had our first ever White Christmas. The studio was bigger than we expected and even nicer than the pictures. It was very comfortable and had everything we needed. We cooked a few meals in the kitchen and there are several choices of supermarket right around the corner. Location is great, an easy walk across to Gamla Stan (or tunnelbana stop right nearby) that gets you anywhere you'd need. Sodermalm itself is very cool with lots of nice bars and restaurants too. Check in and out was easy and flexible and communication with Annika was great. A perfect Christmas in a lovely Airbnb. Thanks again Annika!"

Stock hat alles, was man braucht: eine perfekt eingerichtete Küche, zwei Schlafzimmer, zwei Bäder und ein gemütlich eingerichtetes Wohnzimmer mit Balkon und Blick auf den begrünten Innenhof. Ein zusätzliches Bett befindet sich hinter einem Raumteiler in der Wohnküche. Maria war eine exzellente Gastgeberin. Der Check-in war unproblematisch, an unserem Abreisetag duften wir sogar bis abends bleiben. Wir kommen gerne wieder."
453692,185208997,2017-08-21T00:00:00.000Z,"The accommodation is very good for exploring Stockholm. It is located very near to the seaside and it is recommended to take a walk around Södermalm, the peninsula.
Everything was well prepared and nice. Thanks Lovisa"
242188,47311337,2015-09-17T00:00:00.000Z,"I don't have enough space to leave an adequate  review for Lidia and her place. To begin with, Lidia was waiting at the front door to the building when I arrived despite only having an estimate for when I might be there.  She had tea and snacks waiting after I settled into my room and mapped out various spots in the city to explore.  Lidia was responsive without being intrusive and she even went out of her way to help me with laundry in the basement while I was out. In terms of the space, it was perfect for my quick stop in Stockholm, only a few blocks from the train to the airport and close to the action on Gotgagan street and in Old Town.   My room was clean along with the shared bathroom, and there was very little noise at night.  I would recommend this unit to anyone who wants an authentic Stockholm experience at a reasonable price. Thanks again Lidia."
1170669,6056687,2013-07-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Great communication, lovely house, ideal for what we needed it for. Had great weather for our stay which was a bonus!
Would definately stay again, thank you Jennie"
1156474,37561183,2015-07-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Delightful hosts and home! Jenny and Mikael were very welcoming.  We are a family of 5 and we were very comfortable in their home. The location was perfect and we thoroughly enjoyed the free ferry service offered at the dock around the corner from their location. It was very convenient to walk to Old Town and conveniently located near bus stops, as well as many restaurants. Their balcony view toward the water was beautiful. The landscaping around the area was wonderful. We would definitely recommend staying here."
155685,25034290,2015-01-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Robert was a fantastic host: kind, easy going and we felt he really put an effort on us feeling at home: We arrived on New Year's Eve and he waited patiently for us and even bought us breakfast for the next morning.

His place is really beautiful: amazing views, wonderful light and its decorated with a lot of taste. We loved the location and everything we need was walking distance (grocery shops, restaurants, bakeries, ..). 

If we come back to Stockholm I hope we could stay there again."
1182616,65113027,2016-03-10T00:00:00.000Z,The place was conveniently located. The host polite and helpful. The stay there was great!
1170766,19478282,2014-09-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Had a great stay at Annika's place. She was very accommodating, welcoming and helpful!"
581243,148197690,2017-04-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Эдвин очень гостеприимный и дружелюбный хозяин, хорошо знает русский язык! Не смотря на то, что мы приехали в будний день, Эдвин встретил нас раньше, чем было написано в описании его жилья и нам не пришлось бродить по городу с сумками в ожидании времени заселения. Квартира очень чистая и светлая, есть все, что нужно для комфортного пребывания, включая хорошо оборудованную кухню. Находится в пешей доступности от вокзала (около 30 минут) и всех основных достопримечательностей Стокгольма, благодаря чему можно совсем не пользоваться общественным транспортом и сэкономить приличную сумму денег! А они в Стокгольме точно пригодятся! :) Прямо рядом с домом находится вход в метро Карлаплан и остановка автобуса, если вдруг понадобится. Бесплатный исторический музей находится в 800 метрах от дома, Васа, Скансен, Лунапарк -- чуть дальше по той же улице. Все действительно очень близко.
Стоит отметить, что на цокольном этаже в доме Эдвина, находится большой торговый центр с несколькими супермаркетами, магазинами одежды (например H&M), магазином с алкоголем, много кафе и пр. 
Еще хочется сказать, что видели Эдвина мы только в день приезда. Он нам все показал, рассказал как чем пользоваться, вручил ключи, а дальше мы жили как буд-то в отдельной квартире! Нам все очень понравилось! Спасибо, Эдвин. Всем рекомендую!"
581243,22204505,2014-11-01T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a brilliant time with Edwin and his wife (who didn't speak English, but Edwin's English was more than enough). He was a lovely, kind and generous host. He helped with any questions we had about local sights and getting around. I highly recommend getting the Stockholm card which gives you free access to public transport and entry into 80+ museums and attractions including boat canal tours, history museums etc. Highly recommend Vassa museum, containing the only ship recovered from the 17th century. Also the Skansen outdoor museum is amazing. Edwin will provide a lot of info. He and his wife were not around much and we could use the kitchen, bathroom and living room to our convenience. Would highly recommend this accommodation. Super close to train, really close to city and easy to walk around too. Enjoy - 10/10!"
242188,162974467,2017-06-23T00:00:00.000Z,Li is great! Helped me with suggestions of stuff to do and navigating around Stockholm. Her place was just what I was looking for. It's down a side street so fairly quiet but also right by a very fun neighborhood and near a couple metro stops. Would highly recommend!
1182616,273151075,2018-06-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Apartment location is very good.  Host is very communicating and matey. There is all gear you may need - wifi, iron, refrigerator, fan. But in this apartment with single bathroom can be accommodated more than 7 people. Also it is not very clean and well-lit apartment."
897584,8420622,2013-10-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Viveka has a lovely apartment in a very nice and calm location. On top of that she is a really cool host. So, this is a great option for a Stockholm."
1234109,42011240,2015-08-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Short version: Perfect host and perfect apartment.

Longer version: Nicely furnished apartment in a nice neighborhood. Loved the way it's decorated, loved the location, great DVD collection. Really has everything you need for a trip to Stockholm. Supermarket, shops, a park and subway-station are within a short walking distance. Nathalie is a super-nice person and great host. Checking in occasionally to see if there's anything you need. Really the only bummer was that we didn't manage to actually meet. 
Would definitely go there again!"

Definitely recommended :)"
608672,243517694,2018-03-16T00:00:00.000Z,"I had a fantastic time at Karl’s flat! The location is great, you can easily walk to restaurants and attractions or get to a mode of public transportation that will take you where you want to go. 
It was my first time in Sweden and I was traveling solo, so Karl’s tips and quick responses to my questions were so helpful. He really cares about the experience of his guests!"
1212891,44792278,2015-08-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud è molto accogliente e premurosa, attenta ai dettagli e precisa sia nelle spiegazioni che nelle regole di casa. Ne risulta una buona organizzazione per una tranquilla convivenza anche in presenza di altri ospiti. Abbiamo trovato l'appartamento senza difficoltà."
620848,3060196,2012-12-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Excellent experience from the second I booked. There was plenty of communication before the stay; and a very thorough walkthrough of the amenities at the apartment once the arrive. They helped us out a great deal when it came to suggesting things to do in Stockholm, and how to get there. The apartment was very spacious and well stocked as well. I wouldn't hesitate to book with them again."
1244657,161190930,2017-06-17T00:00:00.000Z,Nic & Usha are great hosts. The bed is comfortable and the location was near bars and restaurants.
259025,4443211,2013-05-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Advantages: very closed to Subway (5-7 min), 20 min to the Center.
The room is suitible for 1-2 persons.
We were able to use fridge and microvawe.
Tea and coffee in the morning if neseccary
Ali is nice and helpful man.
Comparing to all the Stokcholm, the price is low.
Disadvantages:
We were with our baby, so the room was small for 3 persons and it was very stuffy.
The worst thing is that the toilet is on the first floor, we lived on the third... During the night it war really uncomfortable to go down. Besides, the toilet and bathroom is for ALL guests who stay at the house.
The ladder creacked loudly so that I woke up every time one of geusts went down."
1096827,27875494,2015-03-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Anita is a very good host! She gave us lots of tips to help us in our trip and good advices about what we could see and visit !
The appartement is really nice and the location ( Sandsborg ) is a really pleasant and charming place! 
Don't hesitate! ;)"
