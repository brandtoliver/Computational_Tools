Vi bodde där i två och en halv månad, två vuxna och två barn (6 och 8 år) och det fungerade alldeles utmärkt. 
Heath är en perfekt värd, trevlig och hjälpsam. Även om vi aldrig träffade honom, hade vi väldigt smidig kommunikation. Han svarade alltid snabbt på alla våra frågor.
Jag kan verkligen rekommendera Heaths boende till alla som vill besöka Stockholm.

The apartment was more than photos can ever display ;) it was spacious, had The ambience! The whole place is fully equipped, from the kids department till kitchen. Seta as host was very helpful and her warm welcome gave a good start to our stay. We were three adults and two kids (10m/5y) and all that comes along."
1304431,11860423,2014-04-17T00:00:00.000Z,We had a wonderful time in Madeleine's cozy apartment in Södermalm. The flat is situated in a calm area and equipped with everything you'll need. Madeleine was an excellent host and we immediately felt at home. We'd be happy to return. Don't miss the Indian restaurant and the organic shop next door ;)

Apartment is in cool neighborhood with lots of cool non-touristy shops and restaurants. Metro is near by and provides convenient access to downtown. Very quiet area - easy to sleep! Overall good experience, would recommend."

It's very pleasant to walk around the quiet neighborhood. Perfect for a family traveling with small children as the apartment has a very accommodating set-up for the little ones. The grocery is nearby and very convenient. It's just a short walk to the bus which took us to the center of the city within 15 minutes. Sandra was helpful and responded to communication quickly."

1054406,98656649,2016-09-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Lieber Thomas, liebe Madeleine, herzlichen Dank für alles!! Wir hatten einen wunderschönen Urlaub bei Euch! Wir waren sehr beeindruckt von Eurer Persönlichkeit und Gastfreundschaft, dem geräumigen Appartement und der traumhaften Lage am See... So ruhig und idyllisch und trotzdem braucht man mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln nicht lange bis in die City. Für unsere Tochter Ida war es der Himmel auf Erden, im Garten zu spielen, Trampolin zu springen und sich mit den Hasen zu beschäftigen!! Es hätte in jeder Hinsicht nicht besser sein können! Alles Liebe! Mark und Tanja"
1124388,52231178,2015-10-27T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a great time in Stockholm. The apartment was cosy and comfortable - exactly as per description. 
Carl was very friendly, flexible, helpful, and easy in communication. He gave us some information and tips for our stay in Stockholm. The bus stop and a small supermarket are just round the corner. It was just perfect - We can recommend this small apartment!

1255668,266582011,2018-05-20T00:00:00.000Z,Great location and super clean and fresh apartment. Lovely almost rural area yet within easy distance to downtown Stockholm.
700113,61371427,2016-02-03T00:00:00.000Z,"This is a very pleasant place for a base for exploring Stockholm.  It's quiet with a view to a park, but it's central and close to the center and shops, the university, and public transportation.  Ilona is a very nice host.  I always try to stay here when I go to Stockholm!"
242188,86149260,2016-07-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia is a wonderful host! Her apartment is very centrally located, clean, and just beautiful. She helped me plan my trip, gave me maps and information, and was always available if I had questions. I couldn't recommend staying here more!

The apartment itself is in the cool/trendy Sodermalm neighborhood, but in a very quiet residential area. It's only a 5 minute walk to a main train station, and a 5-10 minute walk to the subways and lots of restaurants. It is really the absolute best location to stay to see Stockholm, from what I could tell from my short stay there.

Thanks, Lidia, for making my short trip to Stockholm so great!"
164448,39412022,2015-07-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia was a wonderful and accommodating host who made us feel at home, and the room is very comfortable and located in an excellent area of Stockholm. Highly recommend to anyone!"

1124388,30305375,2015-04-20T00:00:00.000Z,"It was great to be in the apartment of Carl. Nice place, good bed behind the white wall and even an extra bed for our son. Carl was in the house to welcome us and we had a great time. The house is on a small island quite close to the centre. On the first evening we rounded the island on a nice walk."
628555,209850378,2017-11-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Short stroll to public transport which is a must for exploring Stockholm. 
Breakfast, coffee and fikka are a must at AB Cafe! 
Property is perfect for a couple wanting to base themselves in a leafy suburb!"
1048260,123900875,2016-12-31T00:00:00.000Z,"I defiantly recommend staying at Annika's flat.

Annika's flat is a wonderful space with fantastic decoration. It was also perfectly clean and it was a pleasure to cook in the kitchen which has everything you need. 

The flat is very near an underground station which is two stops from city centre and so we found it very convenient for exploring Stockholm from.

The best thing about staying at Annika's was the tips she's gave us about what to do in Stockholm - we would never have known about Hellasgarden without her advice!

Annika's flat is excellent value for money, she replies to all messages very fast and is very friendly and her flat feels like a home away from home!

Thank you Annika!"
819676,271348171,2018-06-01T00:00:00.000Z,"This is an ideal place to stay. The bedroom I stayed in was small but comfortable with access to a private bath with a shower across the hall. Andy made me feel comfortable to use the living room and kitchen which allowed for lots of space.  The check in was well arranged. The place has an elevator and it’s a secure building. The neighbourhood is lively with restaurants and shopping as well as nightlife. It’s close to a metro and only 2 stops from Central Station. Andy gave good recommendations on things to do for a short stay in Stockholm. In spite of its central location, it was quiet in his place. A perfect place to stay."
581243,5466084,2013-07-01T00:00:00.000Z,Great host. He helped me with transportation going to my ship and provided all info i needed. Ed's apartment was also convenient and centrally located.
1128990,40374641,2015-07-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Bon accueil avec des explications claires sur les choses pratiques. Par contre, un peu trop peu d'informations sur la façon d'arriver à l'appart  ( transports publics )"
514210,107995373,2016-10-13T00:00:00.000Z,"We have felt very welcomed during our stay of almost seven weeks at Margareta's place. She had made sure we found our way to the flat and even asked someone to welcome us and show us around, as she couldn't be there. Margareta and her two children have been very kind and helpful. The room and the bathroom look like they do in the pictures. Everything has been very clean. 
It takes about 20 minutes to go to Stockholm central station. Therefore you have to take a bus for 10 minutes and the metro for another 10 minutes. It was very easy to find everything, as the bus station is also only 3 minutes away by walking from the flat.  
The flat is located in a family friendly neighbourhood. There is a supermarket very close, as well. 

We would definitely recommend staying at Margareta's place!"
900043,149106454,2017-05-02T00:00:00.000Z,Flat ideally located to discover the city!
628555,2092450,2012-08-25T00:00:00.000Z,Anna's place was so great. Very clean and nice. The king sized bed could be a separate vacation on its own. She went out of the way to show me the way around her home which was very nice. The neighbourhood is nice and quiet. Go right for it!
608672,16675740,2014-07-31T00:00:00.000Z,"The room is comparable to the whole of Stockholm: neat, convenient and lovely. Mr Büsselmann gave me a warm welcome and provided some helpful tourist information. 
Very trustworthy."
904739,14368776,2014-06-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Menaf is the nicest host ever. He welcomed us in a cool apartment designed in fancy 1970's style with everything a traveler needs: food in the fridge, romantic bed, nice window-view and large TV-room full with gadgets (if you need some). We found ourselves in the hip part of hip Sodermalm with an island-park, riverside bars and a beach five minutes' walk from the door. Highly recommended!"
536283,450701124,2019-05-10T00:00:00.000Z,"It's very very nice to stay in Paolo's apartment. Well located in Södermalm area (near medborgplatsen station), very clean, calm and bright, design and cosy... We had a great week ;))"
974175,81047594,2016-06-20T00:00:00.000Z,"The appartment of Jesper & Sofie is really beautifull, everything looks lovely and very stylish. There appliances are almost too good to be true (they have a golden Quooker and a dishwasher that opens when you knock friendly on its door) We felt at home right away and had a great time with our two young sons. The neighborhood is nice and calm with many cafes and small shops, the park nearby was perfect with a good playground. Communications were easy and there were lots of travel tips to help us out. We had a wonderfull time!"
453692,2054624,2012-08-21T00:00:00.000Z,"A lovely, homely apartment in the most perfect location for a long weekend in Stockholm. And Lovisa is a very helpful and thoughtful host."

1271843,268938590,2018-05-26T00:00:00.000Z,"We had an excellent stay at André's place.
It's really well located and a very comfortable space.
We found it great for exploring the cool neighbourhoods of Södermalm, with heaps of great bars, restaurants and shopping within easy walking distance. The Mariatorget Metro station is also super close, for getting to anywhere else in Stockholm.
André was also a great host. We didn't get to see a lot of him because there is so much do in Stockholm and we spent every hour possible getting to know the city, but we did have a couple of great chats and he checked in a few times with us via email, to make sure everything was going well and with some really helpful tips. He's a genuinely lovely guy and we highly recommend staying here.
Our only regret is that we couldn't stay longer!"
819676,450687570,2019-05-10T00:00:00.000Z,You can feel ease at home! Really chill place to stay. The host are so friendly : )

Återkommer gärna till denna lägenhet även nästa gång jag kommer till Stockholm."
1234109,283366115,2018-06-29T00:00:00.000Z,The host canceled this reservation 44 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1234109,6135254,2013-07-31T00:00:00.000Z,"Nathalie's home is a bright, cosy and convenient apartment matching exactly the description and photos of the website. 
It was a pleasant place to stay, sleep and relax. 
Located just around the corner of a wonderful green park, the neighborhood is very quiet and safe, 3 minutes walking from metro lines, different buses and shops too; very easy to reach quickly Central station, Nybroplan, Södermalm or other main spots, day and night.  
Five minutes walking from Nörr Mälarstrand, a beautiful walk by the sea with few pretty summer restaurants all along the way, spotting lovely views on the city. We did not meet Nathalie but she left us helpful suggestions to see and do in Stockholm.  
We just enjoyed our sunny swedish holidays.
Great end of summer for you Nathalie !"
1205051,25544735,2015-01-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Viktor was very welcoming and his flat was lovely and comfortable.  The location is excellent, easy walking to Gamla Stan, lots of neat shops and restaraunts, and some quiet residential areas too.  Though Viktor was traveling when we arrived, he was available by email and his family welcomed us to the place and helped us get settled. Great experience.  Thanks, Viktor!"
688947,81152554,2016-06-21T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed 8 nights and we had the whole flat. The place was very nice, quiet, clean and close to the metro. However there was no wifi but Alex gave us some way to have it.
We were very well welcomed, Alexandre is very nice.
Totally recommended!"
164448,54770143,2015-11-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Staying with Lidia was a perfect base for us on our long weekend in Stockholm. The bed was so comfortable, and the bathroom was very good. There was a shared living space upstairs right outside our room where Lidia left tea making facilities etc. Location wide this is fantastic. Loads of public transport options extremely close by. Lots of places to eat, drink or look at some shops. And it was a very simple and short walk to the old town (about 20min I think) and then into the downtown area. Lidia was so helpful! When we arrived VERY late from the airport she stayed up to meet us and took the time to sit down with us, make a pot of tea, and discuss all the things we wanted to do while visiting. She gave us a map and helped us to know where everything was. Throughout our stay she was always helpful with ideas and even researched a lovely restaurant for us for brunch on Sunday!
It is worth noting that Lidia has two rooms that she rents out and these rooms share the one bathroom and the living space. Lidia bases herself downstairs. This wasn't an issue for us at all."
164448,109581900,2016-10-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia was wonderful host. She made us feel like at home. Welcomed us warmy and gave us good advices about interesting touristic attraction and Nice shopping places. She was very disponible for us.
The apartment is good located next to subway station. We were in city center very quickly."
313763,70706487,2016-04-19T00:00:00.000Z,It was a pleasure staying at Martins Appartment in Stockholm. He made it easy from the start! We had everything we needed and were situated in the middle of a beautiful part of town with everything on our doorstep. Wonderful!
220851,24958587,2015-01-04T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment is beautiful, the location is great, and most importantly - Fredric was a great host, from the first moment he welcomed me to his apartment, throughout all my stay. Hope I'll get to chance to see him again soon!"
1182616,210212415,2017-11-08T00:00:00.000Z,Peter's apartment is very well located. There are 3 airbnb rooms but we were alone the whole time. It's easy to communicate with Peter. I agree with the comment that it's a bit like a youth hostel which was perfect for us.
916806,33441250,2015-05-28T00:00:00.000Z,We had a wonderful time in Stockholm and we liked very much the appartment of Mansour. It is beatifully located at the edge of Skarholmen so very close to nature. Mansour was helpful and there was a nice information packet in the appartment which was veryuseful.
299154,115942950,2016-11-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Great place to stay in the heart of Stockholm, easy to get around and close to lots of pubs and bars!

1124388,9024992,2013-12-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Carl was very nice and helpful. He is a very generous host since he was ready to make available coffee and everthing we needed for breakfast, and even more. 

We were three and the extra bed was ok. We had a really nice stay at his place, which was very clean and convenient. We took the bus to go to town but we also walked (around 45min) and the path is really nice for those who don't mind."
1124388,12820356,2014-05-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Carl provided us with a lot of tips for our stay in STHLM, nice guy, totally recommend this place if u want to stay close by the city center."
1035775,54278139,2015-11-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Ho scelto questo appartamento per mio fratello, dato che non mi era possibile ospitarlo a casa mia, vivo infatti a Stoccolma, a pochi passi dall'appartamento di Magnus. La zona e' molto bella e tranquilla a pochi passi c'e' la stazione della metro e una fermata con due linee di bus. Raggiungere il centro storico di Stoccolma risulta molto facile e rapido. L'appartamento e' molto accogliente e pulito con un bel terrazzino. In cucina c'e' tutto il necessario per prepararsi da mangiare. Consigliato e sicuramente lo terro' in considerazione quando amici/parenti verranno a trovarmi a Stoccolma!"
873383,158127174,2017-06-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Her room is very lovely. It makes me comfortable like my home. It is calm and peaceful. Living room(apple tv 4 generation) and kitchen are spacious and available. Your room is also spacious and have lots of storage space. There is multi tab. Her house is full of beautiful plants and pictures. When you wake up or come to home, cute cat will say hello to you. She helped me out quickly when I have questions.
Tip 1. Go to Sigtuna if you are interested in history and runic stones.
Tip 2. When I stayed, there was food festival on garden of king. If you join local festival, it will make your trip more wonderful."
164448,207087091,2017-10-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Li was a really nice host. The accommodation was exactly as explained, very neat & tidy, and really close to the train station & market. I will definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a short-term accommodation in Stockholm."
299154,15399375,2014-07-08T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment was as expected, cosy small and furnished in a good practical way. Very nice and personally. We met Daniel twice, when we arrived and later on when he very quickly came with a new coffemashine. Good machine and good coffee too. We appriciated the little balcony and the uppermadras for the sofabed. The road was more quiet than expected, only a few cars are passing. If it hasn't been for the good weather and the balcony the appartment is a little to small for 3 grown ups. Our grown up son (20) was very fond of the decor. Every thing works in the appartment. Daniel is a very reliable and pleasant host."
748847,14362980,2014-06-17T00:00:00.000Z,"I communicated with Heath over email with great ease - he left clear instructions fir all the basics and in fact we never met him face-to-face. His place was spacious and perfect for 3 friends traveling. The apartment was well appointed and quiet. It is very near all the hot-spots in Sodermalm and we just strolled a few meters to whatever we needed or desired.

This apartment represents extremely good value for money with no hassle whatsoever.

I can highly recommend this listing!"

The apartment is located in a very calm neighborhood, near a large park, and within a short walk from the metro and shops. Great location. Extremely easy to find. Highly recommended."

442837,284904706,2018-07-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Very comfortable apartment. Room was a bit on the smaller side, but it was very quiet and the curtains blocked out a lot of light. Has a desk and closet area and bed was comfortable! The bathroom is very clean and the washer was a necessity that was great and easy to use as well! Jo provided me with a map and some local tips on where to see the sunset over Stockholm and other things to do. The apartment is 1 minute away from the closest metro and a 3 min walk to the airport bus station. She was also generous enough to wait up for me after a flight delay and was a very courteous and pleasant host."
954832,406832509,2019-01-31T00:00:00.000Z,"Un petit cocon au coeur de Stockholm ! 
Nous avons passé 5 jours dans l'appartement de Mikael et nous serions bien restés plus longtemps ! L'appartement était parfaitement équipé et décoré et très confortable. Nous avons eu l'impression d'être chez nous. Mikael était au petit soin pour nous : toujours disponible si nous avions besoin de quelque chose et plein de bons conseils. 
L'appartement est un peu excentré (20-30 minutes à pied du centre-ville) mais il est proche de toutes commodités (commerces tout autour, métro à deux pas, bus pour l'aéroport à 10 min à pied) et cela vaut le coup de prendre le métro pour découvrir les stations toutes décorées ! De plus, si nous n'avions pas logé sur l'île de Kungsholmen, nous n'y serions surement pas allé. Il y a de jolies promenades à faire le long du lac Mälaren (tout gelé lorsque nous y étions : magnifique ! ) 
Bref, n'hésitez pas ! c'est une bonne adresse !"

Consigliato!"
1124388,416856517,2019-02-25T00:00:00.000Z,Mysig och ombonad lägenhet med ett centralt läge. Lugnt och tyst fridfullt och naturnära. Helt nära Mälaren med utsikt över sjön där du kan ta ett morgondopp mitt i staden . Det är svårslaget. Carl var vänlig och snabb att återkoppla fanns inget att klaga på.

The neighborhood is super cool, great bars, cafes, and the subway all within a 10 minute walk.  

I would recommend this apartment to anyone looking for a rad place to stay while in Stockholm and would stay here again in a heart beat!!

Thank you Menaf!"
164448,289792128,2018-07-13T00:00:00.000Z,The place is really central; very close to the Sodra station (2-3mins) and in walking distance  from the Old Town and most other places. The room was good; everything you would expect from a short-term stay. Li was very good in making check in extremely convenient and was also extremely hospitable. I definitely recommend the place.

974175,12047611,2014-04-22T00:00:00.000Z,My friends and I really enjoyed our stay at Sofies apartment and it could not have been any better. Sofie was a great host and she made us feel very welcome. The apartment is as beautiful as on the pictures and the location is perfect. It is a quiet neighbourhood and very close to the metro station. I would highly recommend Sofies place.

The place was great for us as a small family but I am sure it is also great for people who want to discover the nightlife of Sodermam a bit. And having all types of ketchup (!), pickles and chilli powder to use is great to be able to actually cook some meals.

At a stones throw away there is a ICA supermarket that does fresh croissants from 9 in the morning and bigger shops are only down the road too. 

We brought our children with us, the playgrounds in the neighbourhood are really nice and have someone to actually entertain the kids a bit. A new experience to us.

Overall a very good experience to stay at Heaths apartment and would def recommend"

The Check-In was easy, although Thomas couldn't be there and we didn't know the exact time of our arrival. We found the flat clean and with all we could have wished for: wifi, sheets&towels and a fully equiped citchen (besides a dishwater, but that wasn't a problem at all). The bathroom is massive and even includes a washing machine. To the next bus station it's a five minutes walk, to tram about 20 minutes. In about 40min you are at Stockholms Zentral Station. We really enjoyed on the one hand the calm and pretty neighbourhood and on the other hand the really good and fast connection to the city centre. We would enjoy coming back one day to this marvelous city and this nice flat. Tack!"

Das Appartement ist skandinavisch schick eingerichtet und sehr sauber. Sandra hat extra Platz freigeräumt in Schränken und Kühlschrank. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt. Das Appartment liegt etwas ausserhalb, die Innenstadt ist aber mit Bus, der alle10 min fährt, super gut zu erreichen. Die Bushaltestelle ist 3 min von der Unterkunft entfernt. Die Wohnung liegt in einem ruhigen Wohnviertel. Besonders gut hat uns die Badetelle gefallen, die auch in wenigen Minuten zu Fuss zu erreichen ist. Wir haben jeden Tag gebadet.

The house was immaculate,  beautifully decorated and the gardens were breath taking. We woke up every morning looking out over the sea. The space was more than adequate for 5 adults. Each slept comfortably with private space. The kitchen and dining area are spacious, and well stocked with cooking equipment, large oven, and a beautiful view. The neighborhood is charming and I liked the fact that we were in a quiet area, but with quick access to the city.  We were able to get to the train station with a lovely 15 minute  walk along the water or by tram. We had breakfast every morning at the local bakery at the bottom of the hill. I would travel back to Stockholm just to stay in this house again!"

The apartment is as advertised - gorgeous, spacious, comfortable and super clean (she really gets it professionally cleaned before each guest visit). Super close to the metro so that was nice. I am sensitive to noise, so even though the apartment is close to some good nightlife, it is super quiet. I'd stay here again if I come back to Stockholm."
873383,159196281,2017-06-10T00:00:00.000Z,Isabelle is so friendly and helpful and we enjoyed our stay in her apartment before heading home. The apartment is slightly further from city but it is near to the metro station that make our stay very convenient and comfortable.

The apartment was lovely, spotless, and extremely well situated (walkable to everything and the shopping centre downstairs is very handy). We were encouraged to treat the flat as our own, using all facilities as and when we chose. The apartment and neighbourhood were quiet and safe. We definietely fell in love with Stockholm and would return to Edwin's in an instant. Thanks again Edwin!"

It was a nice experience staying with Ali & I would recommend his place if you are looking for a home away from home."

The location is perfect from commuter train, also from subway although slightly further.There are some buses around the corner but I did not use them.
The flat itself is spacious and luminous, very clean and with all commodities well set up. I stayed in a single room which provided an extremely cozy bed and direct sunlight in the morning. Storage space was also more than sufficient. The bathroom is very spacious and clean too. .
The fact that the guest rooms are one floor above from homeowner gives a good sense of privacy. Besides, each room comes with a key to have it locked. Still, meeting Lidia in the kitchen is a wonderful time to spend, she is most helpful and knowledgeable when it comes to transport, visiting the city and touring around. She really is a wonderful host, I will definitely keep her in my list when I visit Stockholm next time. Thank you Lidia for all your kind help!"

Even though we booked at the last minute, he was very responsive, gave us everything we needed, including showing us how to use the laundry downstairs and giving us some good suggestions as to things currently going on in the city.   The apartment is even better than the photos: bright and spacious, decorated with an obviously well developed aesthetic sensibility, and a nice view towards the river.  It is calm and quiet.  It was also perfectly located for our needs, right in the middle of things, but in a quiet area.   Metro is only a couple of blocks away.   The main bed was extremely comfortable, and I tend to be picky.  The couch in the living room is also comfortable when used as a bed.  Kitchen has everything one could need, including an espresso machine and a dishwasher. In short, I could not recommend it more highly."
647314,34401152,2015-06-08T00:00:00.000Z,"We really think Mallika's apartment is in one of the very best point of Stockholm. The quarter is really cool, young, calm but also full of beauty small shops and place to eat (bakery, small supermarket). Underground station is just 2 minutes walking. Stockholm, generally speaking, seems always a safe city. 

The building is really good, the apartment is not big but the guest bedroom is really big (more then it looks like in photos). Interior design is warm modern swedish style (we liked it a lot). It's very clean and everything works well. The bedroom is full of light (and we liked it). For people who need total dark during the night, consider is not simply to totally avoid natural light during the night (in june day light is from 4am to 22pm) also shutting the curtains.

We were always out, so we did not live the apartment too much. For people who need privacy or want to stay a lot inside, must consider that to go to the kitchen it's necessary to pass through the living room where Mallika (only night time) sleeps in a curtain separated area.
This was not a big deal for us. 
Wi-fi works great.

We didn't use kitchen to prepare food but Mallika alway asked if we need it and explain how to use it. 
We always come back late, but no problem about noise for Mallika (of course we were not noisy..). 

The price is absolutely fair compared to Stockholm standard. In our experience we were surprised that Stockholm is cheaper then London or Paris."

Everything was so nice and clean and it was really easy to reach her place from the airport beacuse she gave us detailed descriptions with pictures. It was really helpful. Also, it was my first time visting Sweden and considering the fact it was cold at this time of the year it was important for us that the apartemnt was warm. Everything was so cozy and warm. It was great we could use the kitchen and make tea. Both me and my friend enjoyed our stay because the room was so spacious and we had even more than we needed. The bed as well was so comfortable to sleep. I can't forget the view from the balcony, my friend even saw two deers from the window! It was snowing which made the atmosphere even lovelier. It was really wonderful, i have to say definitely one of the best experiences i had. Me and my friend were alone for most of our stay in the apartement and only briefly met Margareta and her children. They are really nice and they made us feel welcomed. Also, the city center is really easy to reach with the bus and metro, the area is nice and safe and you have a store nearby. Highly recommending to everyone who is traveling to Stockholm! :)"

The checkin and checkout procedure is very easy and cost you nearly no time. As we arrived we did a walk to the nice beach at Skärholmen. You can go easily by T-bana to Stockholm in 20 minutes. Coming back is like entering another world. Immediatley after the metro station Skärholmen and a 10 minutes walk you are in the nice and always calm community area, where the apartment is located. The morning and afternoon sun you can enjoy at the lovely yard. The view at the second yard (neighbors) is amazing and we will never forgot it. Everything in the apartment is well organized and we missed nothing. This was a really awesome stay at Stockholm."

Сама квартира - небольшая (это кажется называется цокольный этаж). По поводу прекрасного вида  - как мы поняли, прекрасный вид у соседей, которые живут на втором этаже, а мы просто могли пройти к ним во дворик и понаслаждаться этим видом (главное не мешать соседям). Вид с дворика этой квартиры - это квартиры и дворики соседей напротив. Мы остались довольны данной квартирой."

The area was also nice and peaceful at night. We were travelling with our baby daughter so it was incredibly nice and helpful of Jon's daughter to lend us her toys/bath/cot/highchair! We enjoyed getting to know Sodermalm and the area around Mariatorget is particularly nice, with good shops and cafés and excellent transport links - it's close enough to the subway but we also walked into the centre very easily. Would definitely recommend a visit!"
299154,315983060,2018-08-30T00:00:00.000Z,"This is a cute little studio -- equipt with everything you might need. We enjoyed the location, the travel guides, the tips and the efficiency of Daniel's communications."

1041103,7299940,2013-09-15T00:00:00.000Z,"My husband, sister and niece stayed here for three nights.  Great location, easy to find, good directions given.  On second floor, so some steps to negotiate. Main bedroom a bit congested so we moved the cot!  Overall, a very pleasant experience as it was big enough for all of us and we loved Stockholm. Thanks Karoline and Simone."
1303522,261275424,2018-05-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice place. Best for family with nice childrens play area in the front and the lake in the backyard to walk. One can take a nice long walk along the lake and reach Gamla stan. Close to bus stops and walkable to T Bahn and the stop of airport bus. One may need to share required Id proof copy to comply with the rules and is understandable.   Very beautiful home and a warm host, very responsive and responsible. Recommended. Had a nice stay. Will be happy to be here again, especially with family."

1054406,43057819,2015-08-17T00:00:00.000Z,Vi bodde hos Thomas en vecka i augusti. Vi fick ett mycket bra välkomnade både inför ankomsten och på plats. Boendet kändes fräscht och välplanerat och allt man behöver fanns på plats. Läget är mycket lugnt och närheten till Långsjön var en stor fördel för oss eftersom det var så fint väder.
1262188,6345600,2013-08-09T00:00:00.000Z,"This appartment is unbelievably great, located 5 to 10 minutes away from Mariatorget. Karin was the best, she did everything possible to make this stay the most comfortable for us. We felt very lucky to spend one week in Stockholm while being lodged at Karin's place, play a little football on the pitch just downstairs and just enjoy this beautiful first week of august on the balcony when we weren't discovering the city!"
242188,158684007,2017-06-08T00:00:00.000Z,I had a great stay here and would definitely recommend it. Everything is exactly as described and seen in the pictures. Lidia is wonderful and incredibly helpful. She gave me excellent directions for arriving from the airport (including different options) and great recommendations for my stay in Stockholm. The room and common areas were very clean. I had a very enjoyable stay at Lidia's and would definitely stay there again should I find myself back in Stockholm.
164448,157930337,2017-06-05T00:00:00.000Z,Lidia is a very friendly host. The communication was very interesting. She made good suggestions. This district of Stockholm has many advantages. Many bars and resraurants and the way to the old town is not far. On one hand you can walk or you take the public traffic.
819676,437820436,2019-04-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Andy and Vannie are wonderful, accommodating hosts who did were incredibly hospitable and did everything they could to make my stay as easy and nice as possible. I would absolutely stay here again."
1124388,26329785,2015-02-09T00:00:00.000Z,Carl was very welcoming and informative. He provided my friend and I with a map and noted the best places to visit in Stockholm. The apartment was very cozy and comfortable. It was easy to get to and about 10-12 mins from central station. Would highly recommend it! Located very close to grocery stores and restaurants.
1244357,187542698,2017-08-27T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a lovely stay at Elliot's place. It had everything that you needed.
Well equipped kitchen and if you are a coffee lover, you will get a bonus as they have various coffee machines to play with.
Very clean and comfortable 
Easy access to stores and coffee places 
Excellent communication with the host
Good transportation 
There is an AMAZING large park close by that I went jogging to at early am. Surprisingly there are not too many joggers or maybe I was just there too early. 

I would for sure consider this place again I am in Sweden."
1184553,296551195,2018-07-26T00:00:00.000Z,Incredibly well located space and an incredibly comfortable room. Annbritt is also a great host. Would definetely stay here again.

Thank you so much"
206221,2981714,2012-11-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Elisabeth was a wonderful host and the room was just perfect for us. The apartment is very well located, on a side street in one of the cooler parts of town. In fact it's only a few minutes walk to what we discovered was the best club, \"Under Bron\", and not so far from the touristic sites like the Old Town.

The breakfast each morning was tasty and filling, usually giving us enough energy to make it until late in the afternoon before eating again - an important detail when considering how unfathomably expensive Stockholm is, especially for us poor Berliners.  The beds were very comfortable and were set up next to each other although they can be moved around depending on your relational situation.

It was our first time using AirBnB and we very much enjoyed it! The only thing to note is that there is no Wi-Fi although there is a nice cafe just a few doors down that has Wi-Fi and keeps decent hours. Overall, would definitely return if/when we come back to Stockholm!"
757320,533988233,2019-09-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Séjour très agréable chez Barb  qui est une hôte attentionnée !

897730,98317416,2016-08-30T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a really good stay in Mats apartment. The location was perfect for us: in the culturally diverse and vibrant district \"Södermalm\", but in a nice and quiet, though still central residential area with good connections to public transport. Also, having the balcony with an amazing view was really nice and we found everything well equipped, clean and ready for us (towels, bedlinen etc.). The apartment has its own charms with an artsy / bohemian ambience and nice wooden floortiles. The bathroom is really small and not new standard, but as it is an old house, we didn't expect otherwise. 
Communicating with Mats was really nice and he was approachable for us before and during ou stay. He couldn't meet us personally, but his friendly son was there when we arrived, showed us around and explained everything to us. 
I would definitely recommend this place and if I come back to Stockholm I would like to stay here again. Thank you, Mats!"
164448,84708058,2016-07-08T00:00:00.000Z,The space was very clean and very comfortable! The location right beside the train station was incredible for getting around the city.  Lidia was one of the best hosts I've ever had through Airbnb - she was so helpful and informative and help our stay be even better than it would have been.  She had great tips for sight seeing and maps to help us get around.  Definitely would recommend her as a host as well as recommend the great space she had listed.
608672,41072343,2015-08-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Accueil très convivial et avec un français parfait. Excellente localisation en plein centre ville. 
En revanche le logement est petit pour un couple et pas fonctiopnnel. Peu de rangement et peu de place pour se remuer. La salle de bain est trop exiguë et la douche très inconfortable. Le coin cuisine aussi est également mal commode. Impossible de laver la vaisselle sinon dans le lavabo dalle de bain et pour remplir une bouteille d'eau, il n'y a que le jet de la douche. Pas de coin pour manger non plus.
Dommage car Karl s'est avéré être un homme très sympathique et de bons conseils."
242188,276545968,2018-06-14T00:00:00.000Z,Li is a nice host with great hospitality. Cozy place to stay and convenient to travel around.

You have a lot of space for you thinks in the stor, table and a seperate bathroom with towels. The house is situated very comfortable. It takes only 3 minutes to get to the bus stop and to get to the t-centrolen only 20 minutes. 
Margareta helped me to buy ticket and get me very useful advice! She helps in everything! 
I was really happy to stay in there place!"
274876,4335501,2013-04-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Un excellent accueil même avec une arrivée tardive. Un appartement lumineux, agréable et super fonctionnel. Un emplacement ni trop au centre, ni trop à l'écart... 
Et en plus à 15 minutes à pied de la magnifique piscine de Eriksbadet que je recommande pour ses 2 bassins de 50 m, ses sauna, ses salles de fitness et son toboggan.
Bref, nous recommandons cette adresse et adressons un grand merci à notre hotesse Emma."

755843,143966805,2017-04-14T00:00:00.000Z,Me and my family had a good time in Pär's apartment. It is comfortable and fully equipped. It is really well located because the bus stopping just at the door carries you to many tourist attractions and the walk from there to the city hall by the lake is really nice. Recommendable!

We bought a 7day pass for 300Kr and you can use that on the buses trams subways and the bus ferries! The bathroom is small but I am over 6 foot tall and managed it fine.
There are lots of little cafes, bars and restaurants close by as well as a supermarket and liquor store.
Would definitely recommend staying here!"

It is a perfect flat to stay with small childs, there were plenty of lovely toys and everything was adapted for necessities with children (high chair, child-proof locked plug sockets, stepladder for the bathroom...).
Karolines daughter welcomed us very friendly and was always very helpful in case of questions. She even left a \"starter package\" for lunch for us (bred, juice...). Would definitely and maybe will come back to this place! Thanks a lot!"

Emma was very easy to get in touch with, check in was a breeze, she had sorted us with breakfast and gave us all the local tips one would need to stay as a local.  Best part was coming back each day, felt like coming back to our own welcoming home.  It was that comfortable!  Next time as a group in Stockholm, we wouldn’t hesitate to book Emma’s place again."

I LOVED the location - very central from the train station and lots of restaurants, cafes, nightlife, two grocery stores, walking, and people watching. In fact, even after exploring Stockholm, this was my favorite neighborhood! It was also very quiet at night in spite of being near so much. We were only in town for two nights and so only really had one full day to explore - this was a perfect location for our short trip. While we never got to meet Paolo in person, he was a very attentive host and made sure we were able to check-in with ease. Checking in/out was VERY efficient, faster than most hotels. In my past experiences, this has been one of the more annoying things about airbnb - not so this time! Paolo even provided us with some great suggestions for the area restaurants. I highly recommend this apartment for anyone visiting Stockholm."

It's a reasonable walk to other great sites like the Vasa Museum and the public library. The bed was super comfy and Barb is a very gracious and welcoming host. She has lots of recommendations for things to see and do. Her place is located on a busy street so it's not the best for folks who don't like noise, but that didn't bother me at all. I would definitely stay with Barb again!"

Kunne måske godt have været lidt mere ren, mine børn havde lidt vejrtræknings problemer,  men vi luftede bare ekstra godt ud.
Daniel var meget fleksibel ved ind og udcheckning, hvilket gjorde vores ophold meget roligt og behageligt."

Good privacy despite the shared setting. Hosts and guests are at opposite ends of the apartment. Enjoyed our stay!
647314,20707582,2014-10-04T00:00:00.000Z,"I loved staying with Mallika - the apartment is in an old building and was very atmospheric.  It was exactly as stated on the page and was particularly handy for the metro which was important. Just 2 minutes walk then 10 minutes into central station.
Mallika was very easy to be with and just let me get on with things. Loved the cat too!"
510398,15062956,2014-07-01T00:00:00.000Z,"I spent 10 days in stockholm for work, and the whole trip was perfect. Especially staying in hammarby at ric's place. 
He is a nice guy, happy and open with an huge and beautiful flat !  The room he rent is bigger than most hotel rooms, he cleared every closets (which are huge too) to store my stuff, and have a big luxury bed (very confortable and helpful for my back which was killing me). The flat is a duplex so i could have all the intimacy i wanted even if Ric was very kind - we talked a lot during this week, shared lunch or dinner which was nice and confortable. 
The district (Hammarby Sjostad) is also a superb place to stay, i was here for work but i can say it's a beautiful and confortable area. Ric's flat also have a terrasse in the room with water view on penthouse (unfortunately i wasn't able to use it cause of temporary construction, but i have seen the view which is very nice).

Finally, i can say ric is a formidable host with smart conversation, a beautiful flat in a very nice district and an open mind. He was like a friend with me and he let me all the intimacy i wanted when i needed it.

---

J'ai passé 10 jours à Stockholm pour le travail, et tout le voyage était parfait. En particulier rester dans Hammarby Sjostad chez Ric. 
Ric est un gars très sympa, heureux et ouvert avec un énorme et magnifique appartement ! La chambre qu'il loue est plus grande que la plupart des chambres d'hôtel. Elle dispose de beaucoup de placards (qu'il avait libéré pour que je puisse stocker mes affaires), et disposent d'un grand lit (très confortable et utile pour mon dos qui me tuait). L'appartement est en duplex ce qui m'a permit d'avoir toute l'intimité que je voulais, même si Ric était très gentil - nous avons beaucoup parlé au cours de cette semaine, et également partagé plusieurs repas ce qui a été très agréable. 
Le quartier (Hammarby Sjostad) est également un superbe endroit pour rester, j'étais ici pour travailler, mais je peux dire que c'est un quartier magnifique et très agréable. L'appartement de Ric a également une terrasse dans la chambre avec vue sur l'eau en penthouse (malheureusement je n'ai pas pu l'utiliser à cause d'une construction temporaire, mais j'ai quand même pu voir la vue qui est très agréable). 

Enfin, je peux dire ric est un hôte formidable, intelligent avec de la conversation, un bel appartement dans un quartier très agréable, et un esprit ouvert. Il était comme un ami avec moi et il m'a laissé toute l'intimité que je voulais quand j'en avais besoin."

The flat is located in an amazing location for long walks and is close to transportation all over Stockholm.

302496,93471138,2016-08-12T00:00:00.000Z,"We (4 adults) had a wonderful experience.  There was ample room and more for us. It was great to have one large bathroom and a separate shower and 3 toilets! We made use of the kitchen for breakfast and some evening meals.  The neighbourhood was very quiet and there were several supermarkets and coffee shops nearby. We used the bus and underground (T-Bana) to get around plus it was easy walking distance to the city centre. Coming back to the apartment at the end of a busy day was a joy. The size of the place was amazing- we could all find a spot to un-wind and relax. All in all, Seta's apartment was a great find on AirBNB. Seta and her place exceeded all expectations. Thank you Seta."

1041103,10031642,2014-01-27T00:00:00.000Z,"All fine, we enjoy our days in the Appartement. Rooms are large enought, but not really space for the clothes. But for staying only a few days, it was ok. 
Nice big living room, perfect the near to the Underground.
Contact to Karoline and her daughter was good.
All in all, we would book again, if we will stay in Stockholm another time."
299154,81163454,2016-06-21T00:00:00.000Z,Place was well located and very close to restaurants and down town (10 minutes walk). Communication was easy and Daniel was helpful. Good experience

Cafe´s, supermarkets and shops when you stept out the door. Barbro was the perfect host. She was really friendly and let us feel comfortable."

1048260,12376679,2014-04-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Annikas place is very authentic and personal and I felt at home right away, - which had to do with Annikas nice welcome, but also with the flat itself. The kitchen is small but efficient and very bright, the bathroom is likely, and very cosy in a way, or just with a feminine touch to it. The bedroom has some windows with a very calming view onto trees, bushes and some houses, which are covered by the plants, so you feel safe and unseen. There are shutters to make it darker, - although it stayed quite bright, so bring a sleepmask, if you're sensitive towards light. The little balcony was pleasant sunny in the late afternoon. - I enjoyed my stay at Annika's very much. And i would come back in future."
1153177,5886714,2013-07-21T00:00:00.000Z,The apartment is clean and neat. Very close to the metro station and to other facilities as supermarket and bakery for example. Terry is friendly and make you feel home. I would stay in Terry's place again and recommend it to friends.

The conversation with her was also nice and our appointment in time to . Nice breakfast aswell .  
Nice located and easy for us to get to the Stockholm fair , where we did exhibit."

1182616,35161299,2015-06-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Peter's room was a great place to stay during our visit to Stockholm. Peter provided excellent communication with extremely detailed directions for getting to the apartment from the airport, and the room itself was spacious and clean. Plus the apartment is conveniently located right across the street from a Metro station, which made exploring the city a breeze. All in all I would definitely recommend staying with Peter if you're spending a few days in Stockholm."
1248490,35694201,2015-06-21T00:00:00.000Z,Very beautiful house. The hosts have been very friendly. The place is close to bus stops which can take you to city centre/Gamla Stan in 5 minutes. Quite a few eating options around.  Overall a wonderful experience. Thank you for hosting us :)

338470,79537428,2016-06-13T00:00:00.000Z,"We loved our stay in Gustaf's place. We really think one of the reasons our stay was so great was because of this beautiful apartment and the recommendations Gustaf gave us. The pictures match with the reality. It is a very cozy place right in the heart of Stockholm which is very convenient since the metro is quite expensive. The buildings of the  neighbourhood are impressive and it has everything you need nearby: nice restaurants, a supermarket, bike rental, ... Moreover, Gustaf was very attentive and kind. To sum up, I highly recommend this place for your stay in Stockholm."
278311,4505553,2013-05-09T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a wonderful time at your place Linnéa, we enjoyed so much Stockholm and its wonderful weather. and it was so great to have a walk after dinner at the lake. Thanks a lot for your kindness"

624886,290948436,2018-07-15T00:00:00.000Z,We stayed in Oskar’s appartment with our 3 kids. It was great! The location close to the city centre but in a quiet area with a lot of space to play! The appartment is beautifull and nice to relax. Oskar is a perfect host. So no complaints!!

1158893,421781203,2019-03-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Danny’s place is awesome for a retreat in Stockholm. It is convenient for 6-8 people, the bedrooms on the second floor are comfortable and neat. The first floor provides the social area that is special enough, yet cozy and warm. It is not walking distance from the center, but the subway station is near enough and the trip to gamla stan takes about 20 minutes. BBQ is a great addition to the house, we had delicious steaks in the evening.
Dany himself is an awesome dude, very welcoming and responsive. He provided us with all necessary information and then some. My group of friends and I really appreciated an opportunity to visit Dany’s place and Stockholm."

862528,500017012,2019-08-01T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a very nice time at Arne's family's house. He was very reactive and answered all our questions quickly. Nice tips on what to do. Everything went smoothly, thanks for the stay!"
1158893,150128665,2017-05-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Merci Danny pour l'accueil et la belle maison! Ce fut un beau séjour en famille, 3 enfants et 6 adultes. Bien aménagée la maison à un beau jardin, qui a été apprécié par les enfants! Un seul \"défaut\", la maison est un peu loin du centre, avec les enfants il faut compter 15' à marcher et 15' en métro. Ce qui peu faire beaucoup sur un Week-end. Mais sinon très bien! Merci beaucoup à Danny pour toutes les informations sur la ville et les restaurants."
1119738,330225883,2018-09-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Anna's house is situated in a green, quiet and lovely neighboorhood. It is a perfect location to explore Stockholm city and it's surroundings, since the Metro station  is only a few minutes away. Lake Mälaren is also in walking distance,  if you enjoy a walk in the nature. Although Anna was not at home during our stay, she was really quick in answering the questions we had - before and during our stay- and gave us advise on what to do in the area. The house was indeed very cosy. We would definitely come again, should we visit Stockholm again and can highly recommend it to others!"
739726,7116037,2013-09-07T00:00:00.000Z,My wife and I had a really nice 2 night stay at Sanna's apartment while we were in Stockholm in September. Sanna coordinated to meet us at the apartment and even though we were running a little late it wasn't a problem. The apartment itself was nice and very clean with a quality shower and comfortable bed.  The area around the apartment is within walking distance to good bars and restaurants and close to the downtown/old town area.
739726,20334336,2014-09-28T00:00:00.000Z,"We really loved our stay in Stockholm and staying in Sanna's apartment really made us feel we lived there - and very much enjoyed doing so.  Sanna was a great and generous host right from the first contact, really amenable to any of our requests and providing great directions, as well as emergency contacts.  The area of Soedermalm is fab - lots of great shops and little places to eat everywhere and in very easy reach - especially the wonderful bakery Fabrique just down the road which has the most delicious bread:-) - very important to me, as I am orginally from Austria;-).
Because we didn't have such luck with the weather - it was raining when we arrived and on the next day - it was even better, to be able to stay in in the morning, reading a book in Sanna's serene flat - rather than having to sit awkwardly on a bed in a hotel room.  We would highly recommend Sanna and her lovely home as a place to stay - and she might well see us again, as our 5 days didn't give us nearly enough time to see and do everything we wanted to in this beautiful town."
873383,99052443,2016-09-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Isabelle is very nice. She gives us lots of advices on sign seeing.
It is a bit crowded for 4 people in 1 room."
608672,416873396,2019-02-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Cozy, warm space in Stockholm! The studio was perfect for a solo traveler like myself, and provided easy access (both by transport and foot) to the attractions in Stockholm. For future guests: the soundproofing isn't great between the studio and the apartment of the hosts, so you'll hear some noises during the stay but nothing too loud."
1212891,259705544,2018-05-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Nuestra estancia en casa de Maud ha sido muy buena. Se ha portado genial con nosotros en todo momento. Ha estado pendiente de nosotros pero dejándonos \"a nuestra bola\".
La comunicación con ella ha sido fluida tanto antes como durante la estancia.
La habitación es tal cual aparece en la foto, está muy limpia y es cómoda para dos personas. El resto de la casa tiene todo lo necesario para pasar los días cómodamente.
La casa, pese a no estar muy céntrica, tiene buena comunicación en metro (estación de Kristineberg) y en autobús. Nosotros íbamos en metro y se tarda entre 15-20 en llegar al centro. Es una zona tranquila y segura.
Si volvemos a Estocolmo, repetiríamos alojamiento!"

954832,463439970,2019-06-03T00:00:00.000Z,A wonderful host that's very helpful with suggestions and assistance throughout your stay. We really enjoyed how convenient this place was for walking around and exploring Stockholm.
819676,159436095,2017-06-11T00:00:00.000Z,Very pleasant and comfortable stay. Location is perfect for either walking or taking public transport to various parts of Stockholm. Shops and restaurants around the corner as well.

The apartment is well located, very close to Langolmen and the park and beach of Hornstull, 2 minutes from the metro station. The apartment is spacious and nicely furnished. There was everything needed when traveling with a baby."
581243,3360049,2013-01-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Our stay at Edwin's apartment was excellent. The apartment is very clean and perfectly located - 1 minute from the subway station and within the walking distance to the majority of the sightseeing spots. Edwin is a great host.

647314,46614728,2015-09-12T00:00:00.000Z,"We enjoyed our stay with Mallika. The apartment is in an EXCELLENT location, in a fantastic neighborhood next to one of the best coffee shops I've ever been to. It is a very nice, short walk into Old Town and the rest of central Stockholm. And the neighborhood is surprisingly quiet at night such that sleeping with the windows open poses no problem. The only issue was that I was woken up when Mallika left the apartment early our first night of sleeping (around 3am) for travel; this made it very hard for me to get a good night's rest the first night, although my wife was able to sleep through it."
536283,529012624,2019-09-14T00:00:00.000Z,Paolo’s place was great. Location is close to metro/bus stations. Apartment is spacious and furnished very well. Def would recommend for booking. We really enjoyed our stay!

The perfect place for a stay in Stockholm!"

The apartment is in a very good location, very easy for us to walk to all attractions. It's also close to the pier so that we can do archipelago tour. It's in a posh area, there are plenty of fancy restaurants and designer shops to check out. Highly recommended for people who want to experience the Stockholm local life."

Location was great. Neighborhood felt very safe and we walked everywhere. Walk to Gamla Stan was about 20 minutes. A really nice walk. 

I would highly recommend this place!"
755843,422890516,2019-03-12T00:00:00.000Z,"En super god lejlighed med plads til familien og med alle de faciliteter man har brug for når man rejser med mindre børn. Vi var særligt glade for at der var Chromecast og badekar i lejligheden, da vi ofte kom trætte tilbage til lejligheden. Det skal også nævnes at busforbindelserne lige ved lejligheden er rigtig gode. Vi tilbragte en hel dag på Naturhistorisk museum og på Skansen, for så at komme hjem og slappe af i lejlighedens store sofa. Vi vil klart anbefale lejligheden."

The apartment is new and clean, walking distance to the train, and Mikael is an amazing host. He is helpful and responsive while allowing you to enjoy your privacy. The neighborhood is great, too. Good restaurants and shopping nearby. Can't say enough good things. We had a superlative trip to Stockholm. Thanks, Mikael!"

We would highly recommend this apartment."

Despite arriving over 2 hours late due to flights etc, Daniel provided very easy and clean instructions on how to get in. There wireless, local guide and of course Daniel at the end of the phone if required. The place is not 5 star but I only needed a desk and bed for the evening. Conveniently located close to many local amenities, comfy bed, super host!"

854975,6992677,2013-09-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Great experience! Sergej took great care of me even though I arrived and left at obnoxious hours. The wifi was *fast* which is essential for me, and the bed was comfy. And sitting outside on the beanbags was awesome. They are partly covered by the balcony above so I was able to sit there even in light rain.

Anyway, this was my first time using AirBnB and it was so good to have a real apartment, with fridge, kitchen, etc, instead of a hotel.

The location is excellent, with much of Stockholm accessible by walk. Loved exploring from here."

In this regard he was very helpful and friendly. Note that the apartment is very small, which is fine, but there is nowhere (literally) to unpack clothes as the apartment is full of Daniel's own belongings. But this was a minor inconvenience at worst, and I would happily recommend Daniel's apartment to others. We chose not to use the balcony in the cold and rain, but I think that in warmer weather this feature would be a real boon."

There are many grocery stores around if you are interested in having a night in as well (the apartment comes with a mini kitchen). The host was super friendly, and quick to respond. She even called us a cab to the airport!"
1124388,92687603,2016-08-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Carl met us and spent the time hearing about our travel stories, etc. He made himself very available in case we needed suggestions or help getting around Stockholm."
1184553,89771036,2016-07-30T00:00:00.000Z,"The host provided great directions to the location and was very helpful leading up to our stay. When we arrived, Annbritt helped us get situated and figure out the local bus routes. The location is absolutely perfect: right across the street from a metro stop (3 stops away from the central station) and situated in a charming square with plenty of restaurants, grocery stores, and great cafes. 

We really enjoyed our time in Stockholm and would recommend this place to anyone visiting the city."
974175,45765095,2015-09-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Sofie communicated via email and text and gave us clear instructions on how to access the apartment.  The apartment was clean, comfortable and very modern. Laminated instructions were left on the counter. Coffee and thee were provided, but no milk or sugar.  Shops for basic supplies were nearby. The location was  a few minutes from Odenplan metro station and lots of bus lines."
904739,529206609,2019-09-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Menaf is the most hospitable host I’ve ever experienced on Airbnb, no exaggeration. The easiest and best stay."
1124388,10922100,2014-03-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Booked Carl's place for a 5 night stay for 3 of us. Carl is an utmost professional to deal with. I got a response to the pre-booking inquiries in a very timely manner. 

Getting to apartment

After the booking Carl sent exact information on how to get to the apartment. He is also reachable on instant messenger ( (Hidden by Airbnb) ) to make the entire check in process smooth as possible. The morning we were to arrive Carl sent an email about the taxis. If you're using one from Arlanda to Carl's place, use the Taxi020 (yellow cabs) and the fixed price is Kr 470 as of the writing of this review. Be weary of cabs in Stockholm as it is a bit of a minefield for tourist really! 

There is also very easy ways to get to the pale via public transport which Carl gives exact information on. BTW entry to the apartment building is via a 4 digit code which Carl will send. Sometimes you need to punch the code over and over for the door to open. It seems pretty normal. We didn't have any issue for the entire duration of the stay.

Apartment and Area

It is just perfect place for a getaway. Located in a small island which is part of Stockholm. There is a grocery store right in front which is well stocked and the folks speak English pretty well. We used the No 1 (night bus 91) bus to get to the Center of City from the apartment. Easiest we found was to that bus to Freidhemsplan T-station and pretty much anywhere from there. 

I would have no hesitation is recommending Carl's place for your stay in Stockholm."

Le quartier au calme, très typique de la vie suédoise, à seulement 10 min en transports du centre ville de Stockholm. C'est l'endroit idéal pour décompresser dans un cadre agréable après de longues journées dans le cœur de la capitale scandinave. L'appartement est très sympa, rangé et propre. L'ensemble des éléments de l'appartement sont utilisables et mis à disposition.

Alexander est très sympa, un suédois qui aime la vie et la nature. Il est attentionné, toujours disponible sans être envahissant et investi pour que le séjour se passe bien. Alexander a tout fait pour nous donner des conseils pratiques et touristiques, qui ont eu un grand rôle dans la réussite de notre séjour. Les attentions comme le petit déjeuner offert le premier matin ont été très appréciées.

Une super première expérience avec AirBnB. Hôte sérieux et agéable à recommander !
Merci à toi Alexander et à bientôt ! :-)"

Leider haben wir erst am letzten Tag entdeckt , dass direkt neben der Unterkunft ein super gemütlicher Laden existiert , wo man fantastisches Frühstück erhält! Wenn ihr also mal keine Lust auf Frühstück machen habt , ist das eine Superadresse!"

He also provided great local recommendations and spent considerable time explaining the apartment facilities when we arrived. When he was gone overnight once, he sent a message describing where to find an extra blanket in case the weather turned cooler. A top-notch host! Apartment was well located, appointed and supplied. There was a private courtyard where you can read quietly, have a picnic, or just relax. Plenty of room for two and far superior to a hotel stay. Great public transportation to and from apartment."

The neighborhood was nice, in the center of Fridhemsplan with shops and all necessities close by. Personally I felt a better description of the actual flat could be nice as we where many people there, sharing one bathroom, although it worked out well as we had different routines and rhythms and the guests in the other two rooms where nice and had good sense of order."

259025,6700709,2013-08-21T00:00:00.000Z,"The place was as shown in the pictures and very clean everywhere, which we appreciated. The bathroom is just one flight of stairs down.

Ali was not there during our stay but a friend of him was there to welcome us and check if we needed everything, as well as take back the keys from us on our way out.

The house is part of a set of similar ones down the hill from the station, we found it quite easily. The area was quiet during our stay. We slept with the window open.

It takes around 30 minutes from the door of the house to the central station, and transportation is easy to take and works well in Stockholm, even in the night.
It might not be as convenient as a place in the center of the city, but it was very good for a young couple like us, trying to control our expenses. (Prices in central Stockholm are very high, even in hostels or bnb.)

There is an unlimited transportation pass (3-day or 7-day) you can buy which is very appropriate for the stay. I strongly recommend it, especially if you stay at Ali's. It's paid off in less than 10 trips (the 7-day one).

From the Arlanda airport, you can take an express train to the center if you want to pay for it, otherwise, a bus to Märsta can let you take a commuter train from there, and you only need that transportation pass all the way. (But it takes between 1h30 and 2h depending on how lucky - and efficient - you are with changes.)

Anyway thanks Ali for this place to stay which let us enjoy very well our stay in Stockholm at a reasonable price."

Secondly her place is so clean and well organized. The thoughtful details made it feel like home. Thirdly Maud is extremely nice and helpful. She always makes sure that her guests are having a good time. Last but not least, Maud has a beautiful cat Sammy! He is the cutest and I love spending time petting him. He is soooo fluffy and lovely! If you ever come to Stockholm, make sure to check whether Maud’s place is available."

Great value and just moments from the metro station and shopping mall."

Terry was the most amazing super host, greeted us at the door, had candles lit, snacks and wine ready on our arrival, and even serenaded us on his guitar!  The home was so amazingly decorated with both Swedish, British, antique, and contemporary pieces! We were a group of 5 women celebrating a reunion of sorts and we appreciated the two toilets, two hair dryers, loads of mirror space, two amazing decks that had both morning and evening light, and of course an immense supply of clean towels and loo roll (so used to being rationed at other airbnbs of these supplies!)!! The location is perfect, we had quiet rests in the evening and early morning, even with the windows open.  We felt safe walking home at night back to the flat as well.  Great walking distance to yummy brunch places, ethnic restaurants, posh marketplace and of course the water.  Terry's hosting and flat is definitely worthy of super host status!"

536283,286341111,2018-07-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Paolo's apartment is the perfect place for the solo traveler to explore Stockholm from. The apartment's space is used well and the building is safe, clean, and situated in just about the best location possible. 
You are a short walk from the Metro (Medborgarplatsen) allowing you to easily get anywhere in the city. In addition, the Fotografsika, and all of the amazing food, drink, shopping, and general awesomeness of Sodermalm are within a 15-20 minute walk. 
The space itself is quite neat, gets lots of light, and feels very Swedish in the design aesthetic. You can open the windows to hear the bustle of the street below or close them and not hear a peep. The mattress is comfortable, but worth noting that it is a single size for those traveling with a companion. 
Paolo is a great host and was always very quick to respond and worked with me to ensure I had no problems even with a very late arrival in the city. He also provided a number of great recommendations for everything from bakeries to fine dining in the neighborhood. 
Paolo's apartment is a great spot and I recommend it wholeheartedly."

The Vasastan location is great.  Downtown is roughly a 15 minute walk.  There is a T-stop just around the corner, along with numerous bus lines.  Likewise, there is a grocery store and a Systembolaget (alcohol store) close by, as well as numerous restaurants.

I found it to be nice and quiet, but around the corner from a lively street full of restaurants, bars, supermarkets etc. I walked into the city numerous times (it's a fairly long walk, which I like, but there is also public transport nearby). The studio is completely self-contained and Ilona lives next door. The apartment was laid out a bit differently to the pictures but I found it to be very clean, comfortable and spacious, perfect for one but also good for two. I sat on the balcony to eat dinner when the weather allowed and it was lovely. Ilona was very friendly, helpful, quick to respond and easy to communicate with. The Arlanda airport bus stops about a 15 minute walk from the apartment. I wouldn't hesitate to stay again or recommend staying here!"

And Isabelle has two really amazing cats.

Green Rabbit is a block away if you want a nice fika.  Grocery store is also 3 blocks away.  His place had great working wi-fi and very clean.  He also left out an iron (I didn't use it) if that is important for people.  No elevator in the building (not a problem for me) but it is a walk up 4 flights if that matters.  Gustav was very responsive and communicative - thanks again!

The flat is great - well situated in the coolest part of Stockholm - a genuine home away from home.  Emma was a lovely and really welcoming host.  Accessible.  Nice.  Full of good counsel.

The flat is bright and airy and very well appointed.  Near by is food, and shopping and the easiest of access to one of the coolest cities in Europe.  We could have just moved in and stayed...

If you are thinking of a visit to Stockholm - rent this flat!!!"

The appartement itself really has all you need and the location could not be any better. Not only Stockholm's biggest clubs are within a minute's walk, but also several shops, cinemas, parks, bars, public transport and lots of restaurants.

The flat was spotless, bright and well-equipped. We enjoyed the lively neighbourhood during the day and the quiet nights; appreciated having a grocery store just across the street. Easy and interesting walk into the Old Town and to the ferry for Djurgarden and Vasa Museum.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, felt very comfortable and at home."

Each one had his own real room and real bed, everything is clean, comfortable and warmful (special bonus for some furniture). The appartment is quiet (upon an inner courtyard with no noise, no cars). The balconies are perfect to have breakfeast on a sunny day in the morning. The neighborhoods are desserved by a direct train to central station and subway line, which is very comfortable to move around the city. The street of the building is pleinty of restaurants and alimentary shops and commodities.
I talked to christian by e-mail several months before arriving and he was available by mail for any question during our estancy. Have a nice journey in Stockholm! Tim"

The balcony and outdoor space were lovely additions to the apartment.  The beds were comfortable, although the single child's bed was a bit small for an adult.  The shower was excellent.  There was construction next door which began early in the morning and sometimes made sleeping difficult since we are light sleepers.  The kitchen was well-equipped and easy to use.  Madeleine was very responsive with any questions we had during our stay."

1153177,7333131,2013-09-16T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a great stay at Terry's appartment. The flat is large: we were 5, but you could definitely host more people if you put mattresses on the floor. I really appreciated the two large balconies which were a real plus when the weather is as sunny as it was for us. Located in a brand new area about 15 minutes walking distance from the lively Östermalm, and 5 minutes away from the T-bana Stadion, from which you can reach all the central hot spots, you will probably not find better for that price.
Terry was a very kind host. He prepared us a english breakfast when we arrived and gave us a small gift as a souvenir when we left! He's a really cool person, and we had great discussions together.
We really enjoyed our week-end and I can only recommend you to  stay at Terry's for your visits"

Her place is extremely organised and impeccable. It was 5minutes from a large supermarket and 5 minutes from the metro that takes you into the city in 10 minutes. I would definitely recommend staying here and wouldn't hesitate to stay again.
739726,339145626,2018-10-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Nous nous sommes vraiment plus chez Sanna. C'est un bel appartement, lumineux et très bien situé dans le vivant quartier de Sodermalm, à proximité de tous les commerces, restaurants et épiceries. À cinq minutes du métro et à environ 25 minutes à pied de la vieille ville.  À voir!"
299154,78927778,2016-06-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Daniel was very welcoming, and put out some guide books for us to use. The location was amazing, the beds were good (but irritating to my friend with a dust allergy), and it worked well for us. Also, I forgot my jacket after checking out and Daniel went out of his way to come home and unlock the door for us, which was very generous. Overall, it was a comfortable and nice apartment and the location was perfect!"
700113,102489519,2016-09-18T00:00:00.000Z,Ilona Margareta's place is amazing and in a great location! We were able to walk around the are and had easy access to other parts of the city. There are both buses and train stations in the area. Ilona is a very nice person and made us feel welcomed at home. She had the apartment stocked with all the supplies she thought we could need and asked us to let her know if we needed anything else. We could not thank her enough for her kindness and dedication. The apartment has a small kitchen so we were able to cook a few meals and enjoy them while sitting at the cozy balcony that comes with the apartment. I highly recommend her place to those who want to feel at home while traveling.

This is a really comfortable and cozy place only 1min walk from  Fridhelmsplan tunnelbaba with fantastic neighborhood, very close to Stockholm city center. Evertything is the same as on photos.

The bedroom is spacious and equipped with a good bed, lots of wardrobe space and a desk (w/ Wifi). We chose indian breakfast, and did not regret it : we had different kinds of indian pancakes every morning, which were all very good ! We also ate at home one night : Vidhatri and her daughter Jessica teamed up to make this dinner a very enjoyable moment - both with food and conversation. We recommend staying at Vidhatri's home if you want to spend a few days in Stockholm, and we will do again if we come back."

Her place is convenient to all transportation and very safe . The flat was clean and comfy just like the pictures on Airbnb.
There are many good restaurants and pubs close-by. Shopping was great too! 
There is a beautiful park Mariatoget near which is nice to stroll at night.
All tourist activities were easy to get to from Sodermalm location by walking, metro, bus or bike.
 City bike rental at park across street too. it was expensive to take taxi fro Arlanda airport, best to take metro or bus."

The apartment is within a few minutes walk to the subway, from there the entire city is well accessible. 
Madeleine made sure we could check-in when we arrived right from the airport and was very caring. The apartment provides all the necessities for our four day stay with five people, it was very tidy."

Very close to the train station which is a plus, however, the time that we were there the train route to the Stockholm central station was closed for construction, so it took us a bit more time to get to where we wanted to go, but it was no problem at all.  Overall, it was a pleasure to stay at Alli's place and we definitely recommend this to other guests.  Stockholm, love!!"

He was a very gracious host and ensured that we were well taken care of.  The room was wonderful - VERY comfy bed with lots of room!  Dean also let us leave our bags at his place for the day and come back later to pick them up.

Thank you for a wonderful time, Dean!"

Ils nous a accueilli à notre arrivée et soigné la propreté de l'appartement. Plein de bonnes informations et bonnes adresses, il nous a même envoyé un message pour nous informer d'un marché particulier qui avait lieu pendant notre séjour. Vraiment une personne attentionné et disponible.
L'appartement est conforme à la description, lumineux et fourni de tout le nécessaire.

Nous les conseillons vraiment !"

Upon arrival he recommended some good places to go. The size of the bed was fine for us but it would be small for a larger couple. We had a good time in Stockholm and Mangus' place. Highly recommended."

Solveig was super nice, I really enjoyed her as a yoga instructor. After the class she shared with us a travel guide of the best places to go in Frankfurt and gave us coconut water so enjoy after the class. I will definitely go back to her class. If you are visiting or new to the city I definitely recommend this class."

The location is very close to the train which made it really easy to get into the city, and it is across from a great park/nature reserve. I jogged around the lake there most mornings which was really nice. The apartment itself is in a slightly different location than what is listed here, so be sure to communicate with Dean about how to get there. It is very similar to the photos, but with different furniture. It was not as clean as I would have expected, but it was ok, and definitely worth the price in Stockholm. Thanks Dean!"

514210,55343494,2015-12-01T00:00:00.000Z,"I stayed in Margareta place for 3 months. It was such a great stay there. The house is exactly the same as the photos shown and the room is really spacious and cozy, the balcony is full of flowers, decorated beautifully. Margareta arranged the cleaning for every two weeks to keep the room and the private toilet clean. The two kids are really kind and every time when I ask them for help, they are always willing to help. It takes like 25-30 mins to the city centre with transport of bus + metro. One thing concerns me is the bus sometimes runs only two times every hour on Sunday. So that it is  really important to check the schedule carefully. But that is only on Sunday. From Monday to Friday, every morning I go to work, the bus runs so frequently in the peak hour (ard 7-9 am). Overall, it is a really good place to stay! I definitely recommend this house."

1139359,171276629,2017-07-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Spacious, lovely apartment in a great part of Stockholm. We walked to the subway or train station everyday. The bus stops were also very handy. Groceries, restaurants and shops were all right there.  You are in a city and there can be noise in the evening from people on the street who have been out to bars. That didn't bother us, but some might not like it. There is no bath soap, shampoo or hair dryer, so bring your own. You will really enjoy having such a large, well decorated flat with big, modern bathrooms. We had a great stay!"

The apartment is spacious and clean. Public transport is a nice walk trough the park. The shower is nice and clean. The bed is really good and big (1.80x2.00). Wifi works fine and the computers in the apartment are a nice addition for looking up information. The massage chair is a blessing after a day of discovering the city.

We recommend:
- the food view and expo's at fotografisk,
- The burgers at vigårda,
- All the food at the Hötorgshallen,
- Gamla Stan, Pizza Hatt, and in Gamla Stan is an overprized café, schweizer konditori, where you should try the sandwichpie or smörgåstårtoar."
581243,7069551,2013-09-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Amazingly clean apartment with beautifully landscaped courtyard for residents of the apartment complex only. Edwin was very accommodating. He wants to make sure that you have anything that you reasonably can. He made the kitchen available to us and gave us very helpful directions. He had maps available as well. Always very prompt to respond to airbnb messages with helpful advice as well. 

Protip: In Stockholm, you can't buy wine (or any alcohol) after 7 pm unless you're at a bar. Before 7 you can only buy it from the state run liquor store: Systembolaget."

Il a du cachet, tout comme l'immeuble dans lequel il est situé. Il est au quatrième étage sans ascenseur, c'est à considérer pour les personnes d'une santé fragile. L'appartement est un vrai logement occupé par sa propriétaire une bonne partie de l'année, c'est un point positif supplémentaire."

Although quite far out of town, the transport links are excellent, taking about 35 mins to reach central station. Be sure to get a preloaded SL ttansport card before you arrive at the house, or install the SL app and get a prepaid data SIM. The coop at Fruängen is reasonably priced and has everything. The hosts went out of their way to accommodate us, and we could not ask for more. Also, nice lamp shades."
916806,266657693,2018-05-20T00:00:00.000Z,A lovely quiet apartment which was exactly as described. Very easy to get to from the subway and an easy journey into central Stockholm.

You have all you need - bed, breakfast, towels and bathroom. Also, wi-fi.

Isabelle gave clear directions to the house, showed to me everything I need, we chatted in the evening a bit )

It will take you 45 minutes to get from the Arlanda Airport by bus to T-Centralen and then to Isabelle's house by metro. 
From the centre of Stokholm this is 20 minutes by metro. 

A nice place to stay if you find the altrenative to the expensive Sweden hotels and crowded hostels)."
283446,36266257,2015-06-27T00:00:00.000Z,"I could not have asked for more considerate hosts than Vida trip and her family. Both she and her husband came by train and bus to the airport because the knew I was having some mobility problems and that was only the beginning. Vida try introduced me to South Indian cuisine, delicious.She accompanied  me to lovely gardens.

Both her and her husband were so generous, 
in so many ways. Vida trip is a teacher and taught me a lot about Swedish customs. 

It was an absolutely wonderful experience living with Vida trip and the rest of her family.

On the practical side, it is easy to get to their
home which is in a wonderful area. 

The room is adequate and the bed very comfortable."

We travelled with two adults and two youths. The appartment and it’s location was ideal for us. 
We arrived about 02.45 in the morning due to a four hour delayed train. Terry was at the appartment, greeting us, with the refrigerator filled with eggs, milk, ham, juice, jam. Just what we needed after a long journey. 
The appartment is fully equipped and we really enjoyed using the kitchen when preparing several in-house Communication has been flawless both after booking, and prior to arrival and through our stay. 
Terry is the perfect host, and is highly recommended. 
Thanks for making our Stockholm visit a very memorable one!"

The pictures are only a glimpse of the beauty and comfort her place offers. She made me feel right at home from the first day through her willingness to share. The location was beautiful and perfect in distance from the city center. 

As this was a business trip Isabelle was really helpful. Sharing insights on Stockholm and its culture, along with events and introductions to people. I'm happy to say that I have a new friend in Sweden"

608672,55560156,2015-12-02T00:00:00.000Z,"The host Karl was brilliant, very accommodating and friendly and even helped us print some tickets out.

The room was smaller then it looked on the pictures but was an ok size, the kitchen was tiny and did not have any running water (taps) and wouldn't really suffice as a kitchen had we needed to cook anything.

The bathroom again was ok, small the downside was the shower - Karl mentioned he was trying to get permission to change the draining. 
The shower is a temporary add on and extremely cramped - also floods the whole bathroom.

Location of this flat is brilliant, extremely central and easily walk able to a lot of main tourist destinations."
242188,200635765,2017-10-06T00:00:00.000Z,조용하고 아늑한 집. 아침엔 바로 앞 공원에서 어린 아이들이 자주 노는 모습을 볼 수 있다. 또한 주인 할머니도 매우 친절하시다.

1271843,76383237,2016-05-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Andre and Johanna are spectacular hosts. Their communication is outstanding. They were there to meet us when we arrived. They gave us an incredible list of ideas typed out of what to do and where to eat within the time frame we had, which was two days. We had a wonderful evening just sitting and talking and getting to know one another. They even assisted us with all travel plans from their apartment to Gotland, including transportation and lodging. The location is excellent within Sodermalm, with easy walking distance to city center and many museums and beaches. The apartment is very spacious and very clean. They genuinely made us feel so welcome and we feel we have life long friends. I highly recommend Andre and Johanna, as you simply cannot find better hosts."

916806,9783992,2014-01-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Это были волшебные новогодние каникулы в Швеции! Мансур и Юлия очень дружелюбные, внимательные и отзывчивые хозяева. С ними легко, просто и приятно общаться. Апартаменты полностью совпадают с описанием и фото. 
Уютно, просторно, функционально, комфортно.
Думаю, что летом, когда есть возможность использовать прилегающую террасу, здесь должно быть просто сказочно!

Эти апартаменты понравятся тем, кто хотел бы жить недалеко от центра города, но в то же время и поближе к природе - в тишине, наслаждаться пейзажем и свежим воздухом. 

До метро 10 минут пешком. 20 минут до центра Стокгольма. 
Рядом с метро есть супермаркет, аптека...

Хозяева с заботой о гостях составили брошюру, в которой Вы найдете ответы на возможные вопросы: как добраться до метро, как пользоваться бытовой техникой, как работает входной замок и пр..

Все для Вашего удобства!

Отличный выбор! Искренне рекомендую!"
900043,169999712,2017-07-14T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a lovely stay, everything needed seems to be in perfect order:
- The location is great - just cross the street to the Metro. 10min to Central Station.
- The 2 beds were comfortable for 2 persons - (The 2nd bed, the sofa bed, we didn't use. Rather, we put mattress on the floor, and the Sofa bed mattress on top of it. It was very comfortable, and you don't have to worry about it) 
- The shower worked great, and we had a fully equipped kitchen and bathroom.
- The response time was quick and efficient.
- Everything was clean.

One thing to note:
- No Wifi (it's in the description, no complains), though you can get around with wifi around the coffee shops and such. It's also possible (We learned at the end of the trip), to get a Sim Card and charge it, it's supposed to be really cheap."
581243,462739182,2019-06-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Spotlessly clean, great directions sent to get from airport, friendly welcome with lots of information. Comfortable bed, great shower. Good transport and walkable to city. Super friendly host. Thank you Edwin"
875505,5153522,2013-06-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Well located and nicely kept small apartment. Can barely be more central. Was just here for a couple of days for work. 

Make sure you get the code for the door, can be a bit confusing without. 

Although Electra wasn't there when I was in Stockholm her friends were great for dropping off and collecting keys. 

Recommend it."

1124388,204265214,2017-10-17T00:00:00.000Z,"the place is located about 40 mins by walking from the centre old town area. The walk is very pleasant by the island coastline if the weather s good. besides, there is public transport (bus number 1) nearby (3 mins) which will take to the heart of centre in just about 15 mins. 

there is a good supermarket downstairs which is very convenient. The kitchen is very good and spacious to prepare a good meal which can save you a lot considering the eating out in Stockholm is very expensive.

Carl has a good stereo system (B&0) in this apartment so you can enjoy and relax in the night. It is a budget choice for people who plan to visit Stockholm and do not want to only stay in a touristic area only."

916806,423475715,2019-03-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Lovely stylish place and in a great, quiet location. Despite this home being outside of Stockholm Central, the public transport system is excellent, a quick bus ride into Skärholmen and 20 minutes by Metro into Stockholm.  Skärholmen Central itself is bustling with shops and restaurants, so nothing is too far out of reach. Julia gave excellent instructions getting to the apartment, and checking in was easy. Bed was comfortable, and apartment well heated. My only recommendation would be to take 'nappy bags' as the toilet works on a pump system so no paper allowed in the toilet but to be placed in the bin. We preferred to use nappy bags for disposal out of personal preference to avoid any nasty smells. Would definitely recommend this property for a short stay, and it does have lovely views as well."
299154,171557319,2017-07-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Great appartment!! Super central, with Gamla Stan just around the corner and plenty of shops and food at your door step. Daniel was super helpful and his neighbour Rolf was wonderful as well. Would definitely recommend!"

It was other hosts in the house but it was any noise, it was very quiet. We didn't meet Peter but he was in contact with us all the time to see if everything was good so I felt good with him. The house is 20 minutes walk to the city center and also good options with bus."

The place itself is comfortable for two people and very clean. The room is bright, but don't worry about Stockholm’s white nights, thick curtains provide a nice shade. Karl was so kind to help us with old Swedish crowns we had. He even went with us to the bank to help us out with a problem we had with Swedish Crowns. Tack! We hope to come back soon!"

The host was very nice, friendly, and fast in all interactions I had with him and both getting the keys and checking out were as easy as it gets.

Maria hadde kjøpt inn litt yoghurt, melk, brød og pålegg til frokosten vår dagen etter - fantastisk service!
Vi fikk en rask innføring i det praktiske og et skriv med de viktigste opplysningene, samt noen tips om busser, spisesteder og lignende før hun forlot stedet.  

En veldig hyggelig vertinne med ønske om å gjøre alt for at vi skal føle oss velkommen - det klarte hun virkelig!!"

There was a good bakery in 1 min walk - we had our breakfast there. I recommend!"

Verten misforstod vårt ankomsttidspunkt og viste liten forståelse for vår forsinkede ankomst til Stockholm. Dette ga oss til å begynne med en følelse av å ikke være særlig velkomne. Oppholdet de påfølgende dagene var derimot upåklagelige, og vi vil anbefale stedet videre."

The apartment is exactly as described in the description (The TV is HUGE!), it is very quiet and it is very good located : 5 min from the historic district Gamla Stan by walk (and we walked quite slowly ...) ."
299154,92635319,2016-08-09T00:00:00.000Z,Daniel nous a bien reçu et bien répondu à nos questions
565912,179312537,2017-08-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Patrik is an exceptional host - he was incredibly responsive and helpful at all times and moreover his house is the perfect place for a Stockholm break. We went with our one year old and found the whole experience relaxing, enjoyable and idyllic. The house was near a lovely playground for our son and was the most scenic place we could have hoped for. Everything was stylish, beautifully kept and the attention to detail was excellent. We would highly recommend this house to anyone wanting a fabulous holiday in Stockholm!"
581243,164429652,2017-06-27T00:00:00.000Z,"A great place to stay, comfortable and clean."
164448,296779185,2018-07-26T00:00:00.000Z,"I really enjoyed the whole experience, chill-out yoga with a view over the skyline and a drink in the end. Tips for interesting Frankfurt places were valuable as well. Solveig is very nice, there are no downsides about the experience."
1205051,15401514,2014-07-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Viktor is a very nice host and the appartment is as nice as described - a perfect location to explore Stockholm.

We were impressed by the flexibility of Viktor regards to arrival and departure times and the quick response time, either via email or phone.

Overall 5 stars"
164448,449996074,2019-05-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Li was a fantastic host. When we first booked, she reached out and communicated with us about directions from the airport and welcomed us to Stockholm. When we had questions, she was prompt and detailed in her responses, and when we arrived, she sat us down for 30 min with a map and museum brochures to help us refine our itinerary. She was the perfect host in terms of giving us the privacy we wanted, but always being available if we had any questions. She clearly has lots of experience hosting and providing a comfortable environment for travelers who just want a cozy space to come back to in the evenings. In addition, her home in Sodermalm is in a great location for the walking traveler. Thank you Li for providing such a welcoming and memorable experience in Stockholm - I hope to be back again in the coming years!"
763407,11273662,2014-03-27T00:00:00.000Z,Jättetrevlig och luftig lägenhet. Den ligger inom gå avstånd från centrala stan. Gabriella var väldigt trevlig och hjälpsam.

1212891,6536996,2013-08-16T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed at Maud's house for few hours, but was nice and comfortable. She has a great experience in hosting people so you'll find yourself well with her and her cars. The position is easy to the metro, very quite and easy to reach."
944703,96972520,2016-08-25T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a great time at Christinas apartment. If you get into the flat you immediatly recognize the swedish character and charm of your host. Her balcony is really nice and we spent some beautifull hours there when the weather was good. Her neighbourhood is charming and very quiet. The next Tunnelbana Station (Hägerstensåsen) is only about one minute to walk, the transport to the old town  (Gamla Stan) and other places around there (Slussen, Mariatorget etc.) takes only 15 minutes. But you should know that there is no metro traffic at sunday night till monday morning at 4 o'clock. The way back home with a taxi costs about 200 SEK. When you stay for a longer period of time Christina makes some space for your personal belongings like food and clothes. Christina is a relaxed friendly and helpful character. If we come to Stockholm again she would be our first contact to ask for a bed ;) 

We wish you all the best,
Annika & David"
1271843,161612325,2017-06-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Andre is a wonderful host and we really had a great time in stockholm! The appartment is spaceous and tidy and very close to the city centre, nice places to visit and public transportation"
581243,138881178,2017-03-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Super clean place! Very central to most of the attractions and the best thing of all is it is above two big supermarkets and a shopping mall! Bed is very comfortable. Maybe a little noisy while sleeping at night as it is next to the main road, but it is super good location next to the train station. Would highly recommend all guests to stay when visiting Stockholm! 

Edwin was very friendly and accomodating as he waited for us till late to receive us. Very clear check-in instructions and Edwin is willing to take time to share with us on directions and attractions around the area!"
1304431,142257361,2017-04-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Madeleine's place was perfect for our family's vacation in Stockholm. The description is accurate and communication with Madeleine was fantastic. Check-in was a breeze. We loved the design and layout of the apartment. It is extremely clean, bright and airy, with a lot of natural light. We highly recommend this apartment and, given the opportunity, would definitely stay here again!"
608672,533167582,2019-09-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Karin was super friendly and made us felt welcomed to her place. We had everything we needed and the location of the place was superb. 

However it could get a little noisy as we could hear the lift doors open and close, and also sounds of the lift going up and down as the bed was just right at the main door."
164448,533930292,2019-09-22T00:00:00.000Z,Absolutely everything was great at Li’s place! My friend and me enjoyed the stay there and would recomend it to everyone!
1205051,24842318,2015-01-03T00:00:00.000Z,"We really enjoyed staying in Viktor's apartment, it's nice furnished and great location! We had a lot of fun exploring Sodermalm, there are many nice vintage stores, bars and restaurants close by. Viktor (and his family) are very welcoming. We would highly recommend to stay at his apartment!"
819676,204487058,2017-10-18T00:00:00.000Z,"I unfortunately didn’t get to meet Andy & Vannie, as they were both out of town during my stay. Their friend, Lindsey, checked me in. Regardless, I really enjoyed my stay! Andy checked in on me to make sure everything was okay. Their home is very stylish and in the perfect location. The metro (Slussen Station) is very close by, so I was easily able to go exploring. The room was small, but I didn’t mind it at all. It was more than enough space for me! As a single traveler, I felt very safe walking alone in that part of town regardless of the time of day. Overall, I really enjoyed it! I highly recommend this place!"
954832,327018997,2018-09-23T00:00:00.000Z,"our stay was great, the apartment has everything you need, we traveled with a baby of a year and a half and had a great time, Mikael is an excellent host, he always answers quickly when you have any questions and we thought he was very kind, we did not have time to write in the book to leave a message to future guests but I recommend it completely"
581243,204050108,2017-10-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin's place is clean and located right above the metro, 2 stops from central station, so it's very easy to get anywhere.  If you don't get the Stockholm pass, I'd recommend at least getting the 24hr metro card.  Edwin's proximity to the Karlaplan station makes this the best/cheapest way to get around.

A lot of his neighborhood closes early, even on weekends (a lot was closed by 6pm Saturday for us), but it's still a pretty lively area."
1234960,513346278,2019-08-19T00:00:00.000Z,"It’s the family’s house, but they’re very nice and won’t bother you at all unless you need help with something."
916806,77374887,2016-05-31T00:00:00.000Z,"Close to the city centre. The apartment is quite nice. It has a separate entry. The complex has visitor parking spots. The place is good for those who rent a car. When we were going to downtown, we took the metro. It was a short walk from the apartment and it was really really convenient (you could also take a bus to the metro station). By the metro station, there is a mall with a couple of large grocery stores. Mansour was considerate and responsive. He provided the check-in instructions in advance. He also asked us if we needed anything after we checked in. He allowed us to check in a couple of hours earlier than the usual check-in time. Overall, I recommend the apartment to others. Given the rate, the apartment is a good bargain."
343925,1980969,2012-08-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Annika hat uns sehr freundlich empfangen und ihre Wohnung an uns übergeben. Es war alles so wie es beschrieben wurde. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt. Die Wohung ist für Ausflüge in Stockholm gut gelegen.
Annika hat uns ausführlich über die Verkehrsanbindungen und Einkaufsmöglichkeiten informiert. Alles perfekt. 
Sie war außerdem so freundlich, uns bei der Suche nach einer Parkmöglichkeit zu helfen. Danke."

1132208,6764032,2013-08-24T00:00:00.000Z,"We were delighted and our expectations were certainly surpassed with our stay at Emma's beautiful apartment. Centrally located and easy to find, the apartment is perfect for travelers who don't mind using the metro and exploring a little bit of Söder life. We were definitely delighted to see how clean and well kept Emma's apartment was, and were happy to see the amount of care Emma put into making sure we were comfortable and that our stay was just as enjoyable. Emma was always just a message away and always very informative, answering any questions we may have had quickly and thoroughly. Fresh bed sheets and blankets were made available to us as well as passwords for both the wifi and her wonderful speakers, of which we used almost every morning and evening. More than just a hotel room that we could have booked for much more, Emma's apartment was a home away from home, where our experience in Stockholm was made even greater knowing that we had a comfortable, cozy, chic, clean and well situated apartment to return to when we wanted. Tack, Emma!"
536691,85231962,2016-07-10T00:00:00.000Z,"We enjoyed our stay in this art filled apartment. The apartment was very roomy. The location was great, close to the metro and in the trendy Solderman. Lots of shops and cafes close by."
757320,97995654,2016-08-29T00:00:00.000Z,Barb is really kind and willing. She waited for us even if our plane landed really late. The room was so cute and clean. I deeply recommend this apartment also for its central position.
283446,42438106,2015-08-13T00:00:00.000Z,"We were made very welcome and were well looked after.  The bed was comfortable and although it is a bit out of town the connections via bus or metro were excellent. Takes about 20 Minutes to the Old Town,  very easy Metro Connection as you go from one end station to the other."
242188,411380274,2019-02-12T00:00:00.000Z,"The host is very kind and wants to help you if needed. After a warm welcome, she gives you advices about the city, places you can visit, what can you do etc. Rooms are great, everything is as written in the offer.. The location is just perfect, in the center, and good for arranging any kind of sightseeing very easily.. Warm recommendations for this host and accommodation, as well!"
647314,2288214,2012-09-14T00:00:00.000Z,"We spent a few days in this cozy apartment located in the heart of Söder, the coolest neighbourhood in Stockholm. Trendy cafes, second hand shops or restaurants are just close to the flat. The closest metro station is around 3 minutes walking from it and it takes around 20 minutes walking to get the city centre. The apartment looks just like you can see at the pictures! Mallika is a great hostess! She makes us feel as at home and recommended us really interesting places."
916806,98219807,2016-08-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Really nice place, very clean and looks like the picture. The only issue is there is a pump which comes on randomly during the day and night which is pretty noisy."
242188,527557198,2019-09-11T00:00:00.000Z,Very nice place and close to train station and easy to go any where in the city. Li suggested lotta places to see in and around the city. She was quick with responses. I enjoyed my shirt stay at her place and I recommend staying at her place.
164448,4613808,2013-05-15T00:00:00.000Z,Lidia is the sweetest! It really enriched our (too) short visit to Stockholm to stay at her apartment. Lovely conversations and a great breakfast. She was just the nicest person. Can't recommend her enough!
283446,97711831,2016-08-28T00:00:00.000Z,"El señor Bala me recibio a una hora muy incoveniente. Sin embargo no creo que sea para todos quedarse con el. El señor Bala vive con su familia que es hindù. Es una cultura totalmente diferente a la mia (soy latino) y eso hizo que mi estancia con el, no fuera la mas comoda. El señor Bala es atento junto con su esposa Vidhi pero si no estas acostumbrado a ciertas cosas lo mejor es no quedarse con el. 
P.S
Yo acababa de llegar a estocolmo mi ingles no es lo mejor. Todo esos factores hicieron dificil la comunicacion. Es la primera vez que ocupo este servicio.  
El internet no funciono la mayoria del tiempo. Tuve que usar los datos de mi telefono."

478105,351924566,2018-11-24T00:00:00.000Z,"This is a truly wonderful place for a long-term stay (mine was 3 months).  The apartment is private, in a quiet neighborhood, and a 5 minute walk from the Tunnelbana (subway), from where most of the city is easily accessible.  But the best part for me was the very entertaining and quirky -- in a good way! -- decor.  There was always something new to catch my attention, especially in those moments when a little distraction is needed.  And Christian is a fabulous host.  I never needed for much because the apartment is so well furnished, but Christian was always available on short notice if I had any questions or other needs.  I recommend you snap this place up if it's available (unless of course I'm trying to reserve it again, in which case, disregard my review!)."
299154,416288590,2019-02-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Daniel was a very nice host and his apartment was perfectly located, clean and quiet.
Communication was quick and easy, late check out was no problem, thanks for that! 
Only thing missing maybe was an electric plug in the bathroom ;)
would stay again! Cheers Jan"

1255668,300815554,2018-08-03T00:00:00.000Z,Die Wohnung wurde sehr geschmackvoll neu eingerichtet. Wir haben es sehr genossen zu Fuss zum Badeplatz laufen zu können.

If you are planning on staying in Stockholm his place is def the place. A few steps from the Metro Station and 10min from Central Station makes the location awesome. Very happy we chose his place as our place to stay and looking forward on staying there again when we come back. In a few words: nice, friendly, safe and quiet community, charming, happy, and reliable. Definitely 5 stars :)"
299154,13584874,2014-05-31T00:00:00.000Z,"This apartment is in the perfect location. Daniel was very very helpful and accommodating about our trip.  It was a little small for two people (not a romantic couple), but the location made up for the size!  It is walking distance to plenty of restaurants and even the old city (Gamla Stan).  A great place to stay!"
1182616,132167755,2017-02-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Good location and reachable host, though he doesn't live in the property. Flat has two rooms and a repurposed living room which are all rented out on Airbnb, so it can get a bit crowded."
866768,110254131,2016-10-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Sally was very kind and sweet on arrival and departure, totally flexible to accommodate your schedule; her flat is truly cosy, very comfortable and very nicely decorated, about 10mn on foot from the nearest subway stop, on a line that takes you directly to the heart of Stockholm and its transport hub in 10mn, and with a bus stop less than 1mn walk from the apartment to take you to the subway if you don't want to walk . Highly recommended!"
299154,405428898,2019-01-27T00:00:00.000Z,Small flat but ideal location. Perfect for two or three.

The apartment was clean, well equipped and entirely sufficient for us. Par was a great host, welcoming us in and showing us where to go in Stockholm for whatever it was we wanted. He was also quick to respond via the app but also (during our stay) was living nearby so could also be easily contacted in person."
1149820,91651502,2016-08-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Had a very good stay at Klara's place!  Communication was exceptionally fast and easy. I was looking for a place to stay rather last minute and Klara responded immediately where others didn't. Checking in and out went super smooth. Klara's place was nice and cozy like in the pictures (maybe a little darker) and didn't feel small at all due to the smart layout. Location was great close to public transport (airport, metro, local bus) and supermarket all within minutes and nice places nearby to eat in the evening. Kitchen was a little limited for cooking so didn't try that. Did do some lovely walks around Söder and the two smaller islands nearby. You could basically get out into nature right outside the door!"
916806,67841377,2016-03-31T00:00:00.000Z,"A well appointed, spacious and comfortable place to stay with a short walk to a local shopping centre and Skarholmen metro station to get into Stockholm city. (It takes about 30 mins total.) Our hosts provided very detailed and timely instructions for self check-in and the apartment was clean and neatly presented. It appeared as expected and we enjoyed our time there; it is particularly quiet and peaceful. Both our hosts made themselves available throughout our stay."
313195,36021822,2015-06-24T00:00:00.000Z,David welcomed us at his house and he was very friendly. We arrived on midsummer's day and our flight was slightly delayed. We were sorry to have disturbed his day but David was very kind and waited for us. The house had very comfortable beds and a well stocked kitchen. The house is a short 3 mins to the bus stop which brings us to town. The supermarket was also just round the corner. Convenient and quiet neighbourhood. We had a pleasant stay!

Lägenheten är liten men känns ren och luftig och där finns precis det som behövs. Området kring Hornstull är trivsamt, många bra restauranger och butiker. Det är superenkelt och går snabbt att ta sig hit via centrum med tunnelbanan. Vi rekommenderar Klara och hennes lägenhet varmt."

Before my trip to Stockholm, Edwin sent me an email with all the detail informations how to get the apartment from the airport. He kindly replied my emails with some questions so it was very helpful for me who was traveling to Stockholm for the first time. Edwin came to look for me at the metro station and showed me the way to the apartment. 

The apartment was very tidy and clean. The bed was very comfortable as well. It was located in the very nice area, there are many shops and supermarkets open until late in the evening. I highly recommend Edwin's apartment;)"

We are only a few minutes walking distance from the Old town. The room was great and the bed very comfortable especially after long days exploring Stockholm. 

Barb was very kind and helpful, she left some water and fruits in our room as a welcoming present we really appreciated it. On our last day she also gave us some of the traditional Xmas Swedish pastry."

It is exactly as described, a very family friendly apartment, elegant, airy and open, in a neighborhood that strikes a perfect balance between being quiet and having easy access to the subway, shopping, playgrounds, parks, and other amenities. Magnus, our host, is superfriendly, helpful, and was always accessible when we had a question. We look forward to staying here again!"

The house was easy to find. The room is perfect for three people and the beds are really comfortable. The house is very well maintained and cleanliness is emphasized. The neighbourhood is quiet and a 5-minute walk from the metro station. The area is easily accessible by public transport, being around 20 minutes away from central Stockholm by metro. 
I am glad I chose Ali's place for our stay and I would choose it again."
