We thoroughly enjoyed being there and it only served to make a fantastic four days in Stockholm even better. It is extremely clean and very peaceful as well as being perfectly located. Gabriella was always available for advice or to answer questions, was there to welcome us and even provided breakfast. This was my first Air BnB experience and comes is highly recommended for any Stockholm visit."

Maria is so friendly and obliging, and helped us a lot. 
I would definitely stay here, if I am going back to Stockholm."

1303522,98270642,2016-08-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Camilla was a great host and we really enjoyed staying in her apartment while we explored Stockholm for a weekend.  She was nicely communicative, gave us some tips, and we appreciated that she picked us up from the subway to lead us to her place and handover the keys. The subway provides a good connection to the city center, and the local neighbor has several shops, some good restaurants and coffee shops, and a few nice places to watch the sunset. The bus to Arlanda airport (Flygbussarna) can be picked up a few minutes walk away from the apartment.  The apartment itself was great; the kitchen is well equipped, the wifi worked without an issue. She made us feel very welcome in Stockholm!"

688947,100855962,2016-09-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Ubytovanie u Alexandra bolo veľmi príjemne. Trávili sme tam síce čas len keď sme potrebovali spať. Alexander bol veľmi milý, nechal nám naše súkromie a byt je situovaný v dobre lokalite nie moc ďaleko dlho od centra. Odporúčam."
1271843,322205413,2018-09-12T00:00:00.000Z,"I couldn’t have asked for anything more. Andre is the sweetest person, very accommodating, caring and hospitable. His place is clean & set up almost like a hotel room, so guests can use the space very comfortably. Perfect location. Highly recommended!"

347192,26418146,2015-02-12T00:00:00.000Z,"We didn't get to meet Matilda, but communication with her was easy (via SMS, Airbnb) nevertheless.  The apartment was as described, and made for an excellent base for our trip, being well located for Sodermalm (our favourite part of Stockholm), and also close to Gamla Stan.  The neighbourhood was full of places to eat, go for coffee, and had amenities like a large well-stocked ICA supermarket and Systembolaget very nearby. The apartment block felt safe, secure, and very quiet.

The apartment was spacious, comfortable and well-enough equipped for 2.  Being frequent tea drinkers, not being able to locate a kettle caused a minor headache, although we were able to heat water on the stove.  The only other minor gripe was a loose curtain rail in the bedroom.  Overall, however, I would highly recommend the apartment, and we were delighted with our choice to stay here."
1048668,462708482,2019-06-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Melissa’s flat is cosy and confortable. And it is true: the view from the balcony is wonderful! Melissa is a kind and helpful host, and she even bought some food for welcoming us :-)"

763407,21213498,2014-10-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Gabriella was already welcoming us via txt msg after we landed in Stockholm. The handover of the keys and instructions to the flat was very uncomplicated. Also she gave us all the directions to the bus and tube station which are both around the corner. 
The flat is very cosy and good situated. Shopping areas and harbour are easily to reach by bus or tube within a few minutes. Also very convenient to get to the Friends Stadium in Solna (direct bus)"

She is  social, love caring, helpfull and funny, I've got to know Linnéa in her being as she is, a beautifull  soul.
She's very openminded and easy going. Also met some of her closest friends and participated her groove class, it was wonderfull.
Linnéa is a great host!"
302496,9275324,2013-12-17T00:00:00.000Z,The house is perfectly located and is absolutely gorgeous and very spacious. The 2 main bedrooms are beautiful and extremely comfortable. The 2 extended bedrooms are good but not as good ad the main 2 ones. The hosts are very friendly.

1096827,78826504,2016-06-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Staying at Anita's place was special treat.  Anita is a superb host.  Her directions were excellent, and she was waiting for us when we arrived to greet us and orient us to the house and the neighborhood.  The apartment is spacious and cozy, light and airy, and very comfortable.  The neighborhood is quiet, but also surrounded by wonderful amenities:  an old-fashioned bakery across the street, an excellent restaurant with outdoor cafe, a convenient market, and easy access to the T Bana.  We were just minutes from Gamla Stan and the city center, but the Gamla Enskede location of her charming flat has the character of a gracious 1900s garden superb.  I'd definitely go back to stay there again on my next trip to Stockholm."
647314,5484424,2013-07-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Really, really enjoyed her apartment and the neighborhood.  It was very clean and ready when we got there.  The bedroom was spacious and quiet.  Great location.  Would love to stay again someday.  Mallika was easy to communicate with.  Thanks"

During our stay, Maud was always smiling, helpful, warm and easy to talk to ! We were totally satisfied with the room, which was really quiet and comfortable. Moreover, its location is great. You can either reach Stockholm by metro (the nearest stop is just a few meters away from the room) or by walk (it takes no more than 20/30min). Thanks to Maud and to all the effort she put into making us feel at home, we had a wonderful stay. We are looking forward to going back to Stockholm soon. 
If you love cats, do not hesitate !! Maud has two beautiful and lovely cats."

The apartment is very cosy and well equipped. 
We did not meet Alex personally, but he was very helpful providing very timely and detailed information via e-mail. 
We enjoyed our stay in Stockholm immensely thanks to Alex's help and hospitality.
I would certainly recommend Alex's apartment to anyone who likes calm, relaxed and cosy atmosphere."

 He met us at the apartment, showed us around and made some excellent recommendations for where to go and enjoy Stockholm!  

The beds were comfortable, the shower was also good. 
It was a short walk to a supermarket and a bit further to the nearest Tunnelbana but very convenient in a nice neighbourhood.

We would definitely return!"
581243,130244723,2017-02-05T00:00:00.000Z,Edwin was a wonderful host - we got to Stockholm past midnight due to flight delays and he was extremely accommodating. He is very responsive on Airbnb chat and made communicating with him a pleasure. Edwin welcomed us and made us feel at home. The room and his apartment in general was extremely clean and tidy (especially kitchen and bathroom - absolutely spotless). Location very Central and only short walks to town or a short metro ride away if you won't enjoy walking. All in all highly recommended and would stay here again next time I'm in Stockholm

581243,5842949,2013-07-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin has an exceptionally clean apartment in a good part of Stockholm; an easy walk down to the waterfront and ~20minutes walk to Central Station. There is a supermarket (and other shops) downstairs in the apartment block. His wife was away when we were there, but he was a very easy to get on with host.
We would have no hesitation in staying with him again when we are in Stockholm."
274876,157922285,2017-06-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Emma is an amazing, reliable host that knows how to make u feel at home away from home. Her apartment is cozy, quiet, very well located in a great area of the city. Can really recommend this place!"

1054406,495567436,2019-07-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Die Unterkunft von Thomas hält, was sie verspricht. Die Unterkunft war sauber und sehr gut ausgestattet. Thomas ist ein sehr umgänglicher und fürsorglicher Gastgeber. Ich fand sogar einen Kühlschrank vor, der zum Teil gefüllt war, damit wir am Anreisetag nicht gleich einkaufen mussten. 
Bis zur U-Bahn sind es zwar 1,6 km, es gibt aber eine gute Busverbindung dorthin. Bus, U-Bahn und Fähren sind im SL-Verbund zusammengeschlossen. Sehr gut sind Mehrtagestickets für alle öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel im SL-Verbund. Die dazugehörigen aufzuladenden Checkkarten hatte Thomas uns bereits in die Wohnung gelegt. 
Die Unterkunft ist sehr zu empfehlen! Detlef"
581243,101474590,2016-09-13T00:00:00.000Z,"It is the perfect place to stay. Room is comfortable and tidy. Generally the whole apartment is extremely clean. Room location is very convenient. There are a lot of points with bicycles for rent near the flat. At the ground floor you can find shopping center with two supermarkets. The City Hall and Gamla stan are within walking distance.
Edwin and Lada are hospitable hosts. They speak English and Russian. With a great pleasure they told about main sights and ways how to reach them. Strongly recommend this room both for couples and for people, who travel alone."

The room is comfortable and fully furnished and there is a well-equipped kitchen available for guest's use. The bathroom has a very good shower and I never had any problems with water pressure or temperature. Check-in was great and Anette was welcoming and had good tips for the local area. I was very pleased with my stay."

The location is perfect if you looking to staying close to central area but still wants to have some peace and quiet.  Located in a beautiful and calm residential area, surrounded by parks and small stores that made our stay really convenient. 

As a host Terry couldn't be better. Always quick in answering any doubts we had, he even cooked for us a welcome lunch (that was delicious by the way), which made us feel even more at home at his place."
581243,514535028,2019-08-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Great hospitality at our arrival, with all information needed to find the place, and Edwin waited for us despite of our late arrival (at 1 am, because of the plane). The room was lovely, with great bed, and very proper, and so the bathroom. We had access also to the kitchen with already equipment for breakfast (cafe, tea).  We were there only for one night but we had nice talk with Edwin on the morning. Very nice, I recommend !"

La chambre est propre, fonctionnelle et très bien organisée malgré sa taille modeste. Le quartier est calme et le métro est à 5 minutes à pied, l'emplacement est donc idéal pour visiter Stockholm. Nous avons passé un agréable séjour."
274876,42835018,2015-08-16T00:00:00.000Z,Emma's daughter met us and was very informative.  She gave us tips on the neighbourhood and left us with more local information than we needed.  We were able to walk to the city centre.  She left us with coffee and other food items which was rather nice of her and unexpected.
1251466,11526437,2014-04-06T00:00:00.000Z,"It was a very nice stay :) Basically, we went to sleep after we came since we haven't slept the previous night, but it was really nice :) The bed is VERY comfortable. 

It's worth stressing that it's good for the ones that come with a car and the ones without it. The place is 5 min from metro station and you can park your car for free next to the accommodation.

Thank you for a warm welcome and hospitality. I truly recommend this  :)"

1096827,5963282,2013-07-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Anita's place is located outside the centre of Stockholm, but easy to reach by metro. The stop is at the end of the road and trains to the centre run every 10 minutes. There is also a supermarket next to the metro stop and a nice local restaurant downstairs of the house. The apartment itself is lovely: quite big, very light, and cosy. The jacuzzi is amazingly big and perfect for a relaxing evening. You can even play music in the bathroom. The fridge was filled when we arrived, a sign of how kind the hostess herself is."
1261445,271074319,2018-05-31T00:00:00.000Z,"A touch of old world elegance in a cozy apartment that surrounds you with peace and quiet.

Each day we walked all about...exploring the whole of Stockholm, but always were so glad to come back “home.”"

1204621,516320950,2019-08-24T00:00:00.000Z,this was my first experience with Airbnb so I pretty much didn't know what to expect. Nettan was kind enough to respond to each and every query of mine without any delays. Its location is also wonderful and getting there was hassle free due to the step by step instructions. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Stockholm.

1137050,12890489,2014-05-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Gabriel and his fantastic apartment exceeded our expectations in every way. All communications were brilliant and the whole trip went without a hitch, which made everything stress free. The apartment was extremely clean, comfortable, arty and super stylish…..a fab vibe. When we arrived late at night, the apartment instantly felt welcoming with pastries, milk, orange juice etc. there for out breakfast the next day. The apartment was in the middle of a very cool neighbourhood, with interesting shops, trendy bars and yummy restaurants. Apart from during the day, we pretty much just made the most of staying in Sofo and all that it had to offer. We lived in the Urban Deli, just around the corner where we had supper and bought lots of daily treats, a very spoiling 'corner store'. The whole trip was one to be treasured and I know that having a wonderful place to call home for 4 days really was the cherry on the top. Thank you Gabriel for the use of your wonderful home and we are already looking forward to booking in our next trip…."

916806,269953066,2018-05-28T00:00:00.000Z,"This is essentially a one-room flat, with a separate toilet. We were disappointed with the cleanliness and the facilities. The crockery and glassware needs to be replaced, as do the bed linen, pillows, and shower head (which leaks and sprays everywhere). The owner needs to purchase black-out blinds for the windows, because the sun streams in from about 4 am (in May). We were surprised that a cleaning fee was charged, even though there were areas of the room that were not clean. On the positive side, communication with the host was very good, and there is a sunny deck with a view onto a lake, making this a pleasant place to spend outdoor time (in the summer). Thank you for your efforts, Mansour and Julia; but you need to try harder to provide appropriate facilities for your occupants."

628555,61304386,2016-02-02T00:00:00.000Z,Nous avons passé un très agréable séjour dans ce joli appartement situé au sud de Stockholm. Nous avons pu avoir des échanges très fructueux avec la propriétaire pour préparer notre arrivée et planifier notre séjour.Tout s'est exactement passé comme prévu/ annoncé. On a bien envie d'y retourner.
1173290,27098612,2015-02-25T00:00:00.000Z,"L'accoglienza è stata ottima e calorosa. L'appartamento, molto accogliente,  ha superato le aspettative.Unico incoveniente, per gente un pò avanti negli anni come noi, la mancanza di ascensore. Il quartiere è fornito di negozi e ristoranti e molto comodo per i mezzi di trasporto.
Un'esperienza assolutamente da ripetere anche per il calore della famiglia Gandini!"
1096827,14402851,2014-06-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Anita's flat is a comfortable space with a well-equipped kitchen, a nice bathroom with jacuzzi and a gorgeous bedroom. It is very easy to locate, close to downtown and the surroundings are very agreeable. She's an easily approachable person and was so kind of recommending us a few places to visit in the city. As a nice detail, she left us some food in the fridge.

The living room is great, with a big TV + DVD and a stereo sound-system with turntable, even some assorted CD's. A lot of art books, books about Swedish culture, even an English-Swedish dictionary that was very useful when learning some rudiments of the language. We were very glad of being able to spend time there."
581243,184613719,2017-08-20T00:00:00.000Z,We loved our stay at Edwin's apartment. The room was perfect for a couple and we took advantage of his sunny porch to drink coffee and eat pastries from the shopping plaza directly under the building. The walk to Old Town was easy and it is very quick to get to Djurgarden (where many museums including the Vasa are located). Edwin was so nice and made us feel at home.  We would definitely stay here again next time in Stockholm!
206221,462660850,2019-06-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Our stay with Elisabeth was wonderful. She has a charming home in a great location, and she is the kindest, friendliest host. Our flight times were less than ideal, and Elizabeth was extremely accommodating and woke up in the middle of the night to greet us when we arrived, and left a thoughtful treat for us at the door when we left at 5 in the morning. The bedroom and bathroom had everything we needed, and were very comfortable and cozy. The breakfast each morning was delicious, more than enough to kickstart our days, and with authentic Swedish music in background! Elisabeth and her home are perfect for any couple, solo traveler, or small family looking for a warm and inviting place to stay. I look forward to your potential future visit to the Netherlands Elisabeth! Thanks again for everything!"
536283,471780968,2019-06-18T00:00:00.000Z,Centrally located and stylish apartment.  Check in was a breeze and everything is perfect. Definitely recommend this apartment to anyone who visits Stockholm.
647314,47671421,2015-09-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Ceci reste personnel - 
Rien à dire de notre séjour qui n'a rien à voir avec l'hébergement - Nous étions heureusement reçus et coachés par des amis Suédois -"
757320,520436020,2019-08-30T00:00:00.000Z,"El piso de Barb se encuentra en un barrio a unos 15 minutos caminando del casco antiguo de Estocolmo. 
Está en una calle muy concurrida que, aunque parece segura, resulta  muy bulliciosa y con tráfico continuo las 24 horas.
En el piso puedes hacer uso de la cocina y del baño.
La habitación no es muy espaciosa aunque suficiente para pasar un par de días.
Aunque la ventana no da a la calle principal si se escucha bastante el tráfico, lo que sumado a la claridad por falta de cortinas opacas y a un colchón muy blando no facilita un buen descanso.
El trato con Barb empezó siendo correcto pero  al segundo día tuvimos un desencuentro bastante desagradable que nunca habíamos tenido con ningún anfitrión.
Al llegar al piso nos pidió que cerraramos con llave la puerta cuando salieramos de casa. Pero en una ocasión, estando ella dentro, no lo hicimos precisamente porque nos pareció violento encerrar a una persona dentro.
Esto provocó en ella una enfado desproporcionado en el que mostró su caracter inestable y unos modos muy poco apropiados.
Exigiéndonos, como nueva norma, que la avisáramos cada vez que entrábamos o salíamos de la casa; algo que acostumbramos a hacer por educación pero no por obligación.
Por otra parte, aunque para nosotros no fué un problema, no nos pareció bien que conviviese con un perro y no lo comunicase en las características de la vivienda.
Nuestra experiencia en la casa fué tan desagradable que llegó a afectar nuestras vacaciones en Estocolmo incluso cuando estábamos fuera de la casa.
Por estos motivos, por supuesto NO repetiríamos, y NO recomendamos este alojamiento.


Barb's apartment is located in a neighborhood about 15 minutes walk from Stockholm's old town.
It is in a very busy street that, although it seems safe, is very noisy and with 24-hour continuous traffic.
On the floor you can make use of the kitchen and bathroom.
The room is not very spacious but enough to spend a couple of days.
Although the window does not face the main street you hear enough traffic, which added to the clarity due to lack of blackout curtains and a very soft mattress does not facilitate a good rest.
The deal with Barb began to be correct but on the second day we had a rather unpleasant disagreement that we had never had with any host.
Upon arriving at the apartment she asked us to lock the door when we left home. But on one occasion, while she was inside, we didn't do it precisely because we found it violent to lock a person inside.
This caused in her a disproportionate anger in which she showed her unstable character and very inappropriate ways.
Requiring us, as a new rule, to let her know each time we entered or left the house; something we used to do for education but not for obligation.
On the other hand, although it was not a problem for us, it did not seem right for us to live with a dog and not communicate it in the characteristics of the house.
Our experience at home was so unpleasant that it affected our vacation in Stockholm even when we were away from home.
For these reasons, of course we would NOT repeat, and we DO NOT recommend this accommodation."
475409,28308848,2015-03-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Cor was very welcoming (thank you for the gift!) and helpful. The studio was exactly what we expected. It was clean and actually quite spacious. It had everything we needed. Sodermalm is a great area to stay in, easily accesible and very relaxed. We appreciated the host's flexibility with check out. We also learned the Swedes aparently don't use electric kettles as much as we do :)  I highly recommend staying at Cor's for a short stay in Stockholm."
1212891,111995962,2016-11-03T00:00:00.000Z,"We felt at home immediately! Maud and her lovely cat Sammy have such a beautiful home and we had a very pleasant stay at her appartment. The communication before the stay, the welcoming and the nights we spent there, were just perfect. The room has just everything you need for a short stay and everything is really clean. Thanks again Maud, we would like to come back one day."
1244657,332806313,2018-10-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Nic and Usha’s home is architecturally beautiful and well-decorated, as well as perfectly located for exploring Södermalm and Gamla Stan. Everything is within walking distance - shops, restaurants, coffee shops; the Slussen metro station is also nearby if you wish to see other parts of the city. My room was very comfortable for both relaxing and working, and Nic and Usha were welcoming and generous hosts. I’d recommend their place to all."
1212891,13786281,2014-06-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud's place was very accessible by metro. When we arrived, we had no trouble locating her apartment as she had a post-it stuck on her door addressing us. We felt welcomed even before entering her house. Maud was always all smiles during our stay and would always greet us. She is very open to chatting about her life or about the different origins of her guests. It was a pity that we could not stay longer to get to know her better. The apartment was very tidy and cosy and the cats played good hosts too; very affectionate and absolutely adorable. We would definitely consider a stay with Maud again should we visit stockholm in future."
541875,15203084,2014-07-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Martin was a great host! On short notice, he helped me out when my parents came visiting. He met us at Karlaplan and took us to the flat and had prepared with coffee and biscuits. The flat was very clean and tidy and there was even two bathrobes. My dad said it was the most comfortable bed he ever slept in. If I need a place again, I know who to contact. Thanks a lot Martin!"
1182616,147547088,2017-04-27T00:00:00.000Z,"L'appartement est très bien situé avec de nombreuses commodités alentours.
Ce logement s'adresse surtout à un public jeune car cela ressemblait assez à une auberge de jeunesse.
Peter est très accueillant et répond à toutes les questions même s'il n'est pas sur place."
873383,94849130,2016-08-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Peaceful and quiet environment, not far from the metro station. 
Lovers of cats will be pleasantly surprised by the nice cat Rocky. 
He makes a fight for you of \"their five minutes\" caressing, scratching, loud will thank you and then fell asleep."

1304431,301946381,2018-08-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Our young family enjoyed a lovely stay in Madeleine’s apartment. Her style is fantastic and the apartment has everything we needed for us and our 2 little girls. Good location with parks, supermarket and subway nearby. Only a couple of stops to our favourite coffee shop in Stockholm (Drop Coffee) or an extra stop to Slussen where we caught the ferry across to Skansen, Junibacken, Vasa etc. Would definitely stay here again!"
533880,1526698,2012-06-20T00:00:00.000Z,Jarl was a delight. He gave me detailed instructions on how to get to the place along with every accommodation needed while I was there. Bonus: I loved meeting his adorable children.
858902,14479064,2014-06-20T00:00:00.000Z,"The appartment was placed in a very centric position but it was not in the crowded part of Stockholm, it was much more like real Stockhom life. The room is very big, comfortable and bright, with lot of place for my staff. I felt really comfortable and I recommend it for sure."
581243,76542282,2016-05-28T00:00:00.000Z,Edwin and his wife were lovely hosts. They have beautifully simple and clean home in a quiet yet accessible neighbourhood.
1124388,78393522,2016-06-06T00:00:00.000Z,We stayed 3 nights at Carl's studio.  Carl was very communicative and helpful.  The neighborhood was good.
974175,117183288,2016-12-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Sofia and Jesper were fantastic hosts and were also very accommodating to our requests for late checkouts. We stayed in their lovely apartment twice on our visits to Stockholm! Everything went very smoothly including clear instructions on how to check in. The apartment is really lovely with nice decor and fantastic appliances. The sound system especially is so cool, u can download an app and play your own songs as you cook! Everything that you would neeed to make this apartment feel like home is here! My kids didn't want to leave the apartment at all. There were nice touches like milk and cookies and candles . It really made us feel as if we were at home away from home. We are a family of 5 and the apartment was comfy and big enough for us.  Everyone had their own space. I highly recommend this lovely apartment should you decide to come to Stockholm.  Thanks so much Sofie and Jesper for making this a lovely holiday for us to remember !"
700113,90246454,2016-07-31T00:00:00.000Z,"This was my second stay at Ilona's and I'm really glad I came back. Ilona is an excellent host: nice and kind, always available if you need something. The studio she rents out is a comfortable room with own bathroom and kitchenette, excellent for one person or a couple. Central location, a stone's throw from a big park, fantastic for joggers as well as for those enjoying a stroll or a swim. Swimming pool just opposite available as well. The room has a dedicated router, so the internet reception is perfect. The studio has been renovated as well since my last stay. 
If I'm in Stockholm again Ilona's apartment will be my first choice."
313763,55933131,2015-12-07T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a great time staying at Martin's flat - everything was as described on the listing.The beds were comfy, and the kitchen was well stocked and the TV had plenty of channels. There is also a great balcony (we were there in winter, but it has a nice view of a local church). 

The area is also really nice, with plenty of bars, coffee shops and the metro is a 2 minute walk away, and only about 5 minutes to central Stockholm. There is also a convenience store just around the corner.

Martin was friendly, and greeted us at the flat, and had provided some great tips for local restaurants/bars etc. He always got back to e-mails/messages very quickly, and was very flexible when it came to us checking out. :)"

The appartment was a real pleasure to stay in, really clean, feeling fresh and cosy, big enough for two . we loved it .Marie's been really great with us as well, from showing us things to check on the map to making sure everything was ok , an overall 5 stars experience."
819676,126372285,2017-01-11T00:00:00.000Z,I had a great time staying at Andy & Vannie’s. The room was very cozy and clean. Their place is beautiful and certainly has its Swedish charm. It is very close to the metro station and also everything else. Andy was very helpful in making sure that you have no problem finding the place as well as getting into the place. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to visit Stockholm.
1212891,79015818,2016-06-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud von der ersten Minute bis zum Abschied um mich und mein Wohlergehen bemüht.

Vielen Dank für die schöne Zeit."

Would highly recommend it."

1261445,48605984,2015-09-27T00:00:00.000Z,"It is not easy to avoid the uncertainties and doubts when you go to a place that you’ve never been before, you never know what you will find, but with Marie-Louise and Bianca It wasn’t like that, It was like go to a friend’s apartment that welcomes you with a smile and shows you everything as it is, even what you get is better. It is nice feeling of gratitude in that first moment, and a pleasure the rest of the days. The neighbourhood is quite and public transportation is good, the subway is less than five minutes walking from the apartment."
581243,98643300,2016-09-01T00:00:00.000Z,We spent 3 nights in Stockholm at Edwin's. The room as the rest of the appartment was clean and the bed comfortable. We enjoyed the location which is very close to a subway station in a nice neighbourhood. Edwin was very nice and available the contact was easy and friendly. I recommend !
776012,97357045,2016-08-27T00:00:00.000Z,"The hosts gave us a very warm welcome and provided useful tips for restaurants.

His apartment is very well situated and is furnished with some nice examples of great style. It was very comfortable for two people to stay and we used its great location to full advantage exploring the neighborhood most days.

536691,14283308,2014-06-16T00:00:00.000Z,"We really liked Cecilia's flat. It has lots of character, everything you need and a very comfortable bed. It's bright and friendly and very well placed for visiting Stockholm. We used the City Bikes and there is a drop off point 200 metres from the flat. The walk into town along the 'Monteliusvägen' is really beautiful, especially at sunset. 
We found communication with Cecilia friendly but rather slow-going and there was big mix up when we arrived and the key was not in the bistro where it should have been so we could not get into the flat. This turned out not to have been Cecilia's fault but it still left us having to find different accomodation at 10pm. The next day this was all cleared up and Cecilia reimbursed us promptly. Despite this mishap we would happily return to Cecilia's flat."
536283,4858120,2013-05-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Paolo's apartment was super conveniently located - very very close to the nearest train station (just two stops from the central train station), and right in the cool Sodermalm/Sofo district where there are tons of cute shops, cafes, restaurants, etc. (I'm in love with the area...have to go back!). The apartment was spacious and full of light, which we both loved, and I was happy to get to use his imac to look things up online."

1153177,40628969,2015-08-01T00:00:00.000Z,"This was our first Airbnb experience and it was flawless. I've only rented condos or homes when I've not stayed in hotels in the past and been expected to launder sheets and towels (or bring my own) and clean the house before leaving. This was a true bed and breakfast and Terry was a true and gracious host. He arranged for a car for us so we had transport to the apartment, then greeted us with an amazing spread of food, including delicious homemade pasta and salad dishes. The kitchen was stocked with all the essentials, as was the bath, should we have needed additional toiletries. He shared all the tips we'd need to get around town, and was responsive when we reached out to him. I would not only stay there again but also stay in other Airbnb properties based on this experience. Terry, you're the best! Thanks again!"
755843,261848064,2018-05-07T00:00:00.000Z,A great place for 3-4 people! Very central and very clean!
514210,27989706,2015-03-16T00:00:00.000Z,Margareta is a very cultivated woman with two beautiful and very polite children. Also she is a great host and made my first two months in Stockholm really easy. She helped me settling and gave all sorts of advice about the city. I am very grateful. The neighbourhood is enclaved in a beautiful little forest and is super safe and quiet. The view from the room is pretty to the forest. The bathroom is private and everything is always tidy and super clean.  Also the bus stop is very close by and connects in no time to the city. Highly recommended for couples and tourists!
1212891,47457663,2015-09-19T00:00:00.000Z,"It was really great to stay with Maud. We were warmly welcomed and the room was nice. Maud is a very nice, warm, helpful and amazing person. You can ask her everything and she tries to make everything perfect for you. The location is also great - Near the sea and not far away from the city center going by metro (or even by walking if you have time). 
You can really feel home here and for sure you will enjoy your holidays while staying with Maud!

A perfect place to stay! Thank you!
We will come again!"

1128990,39255556,2015-07-21T00:00:00.000Z,Yvonne was very responsive to our inquiries and questions and pointing us in the right directions to the best places.

First, the price/value of this place is hard to beat. Second, Karl is totally professional in everything he does: he is very responsive to communications, his place is clean, and he does a very good job orienting you to the studio and Stockholm. Specific to my stay, Karl helped me reserve time to use the building laundry room and made sure I was comfortable using the machines. He was also flexible with check-in (early) and check-out (holding my bag for the day). The bed is comfortable, I had no issues with the shower, and the location is fantastic.

It seemed that a quick cleaning had missed things like dust on mirrors and food in microwave. But the beds were comfortable and it was the perfect location, blocks from lots of cafes and restaurants and cool vintage shops and an easy 10 min walk to the subway station, and 20 to Gamla Stan old town area and its historic sites. The apartment was big enough for us to relax in living room before going out at night. The shower took some getting used to (we weren't accustomed to handheld showers faucets that you hold over yourself with one arm) but that was part of the experience. Anete was also responsive to my emails with questions about how to work the coffee maker and where to put recycling, and she kindly lent us a converter."

302496,199529935,2017-10-02T00:00:00.000Z,"What an amazing home!  
Seta's home is very large, bright, quiet, central.  It is perched on the 3rd floor (Accessible via elevator) and the house is sun lit and very bright with open layout.  There are artworks throughout the home which brings out the character to the home.  Getting around is super easy as the bus station is immediately in front of the house and there are both Green & Red line T-bana(subway) stations near by.   There are lot of great dining options and stores near by as well.

I had an opportunity to meet both Seta and her son in person, and they seem super kind and welcoming in many ways.  All-in-all, my family and I had a wonderful stay at Seta's place.  

Seta, thank you for opening your home to us.  We love Stockholm and staying at your home has been a memorable Stockholm experience."

974175,6709505,2013-08-22T00:00:00.000Z,"We spent a week in the apartment. It is spacious, clean, very well furnished, in a great position to visit the city (close to the subway and a few minutes walk from the centre) and neighbors are quiet. 
Sophie was very friendly and helpful, if we return to Stockholm we would certainly stay at Sophie's."
1212891,70863947,2016-04-21T00:00:00.000Z,Maud was an excellent host. She went through everything with me and made me feel right at home.  The location is in a residential area 6 minutes from the subway station with a massive supermarket about 5 minutes away. I was traveling alone and it was really easy to get around and come back from a long day of exploring the beautiful stockholm. My only regret is not being able to get to know Maud more as I was in and out most of the day. Great place to stay.

La ubicació no és la més ideal ja que està bastant allunyat del centre però les connexions amb transport públic són correctes i t'assegura silenci a la nit. La Melissa ens va deixar diferents aliments per als esmorzars.
Molt recomanable."

Daniel is very responsive and answered all my questions within 5-10 minutes. Place is as listed, small with beds in the main area, it is a studio.  Fully functional kitchen and refrigerator. Daniel, I do believe, also lives there when not rented, which is apparent from his stuff being present. Place is very clean but little cluttered with extra stuff. Believe this is in the description, so no big deal. Just know there is not much place for clothes, etc. Again, great value and location in my opinion.  Thanks Daniel for making my trip great."

The flat is close to bus stops and train stops and is one stop away from central station. It is about a 45 min ride to and from Arlanda airport.

He tried to make our time there as comfortable as possible. And what is very important - he was not pesky. 
About apartment: its located in calm green area of Stockholm 2-3 min away from Tunelbana (Subway) and 20 min from City Center. By my opinion, if u want to learn how is real  Swedish people live – u should stay in this area! Apartment has everything u may need. Its clean, cozy, with bright rooms, lovely kitchen with big table – perfect for friendly dinner or wine party like we had))) 
Unfortunately we could not use the small nice sunny balcony … – it was raining…but next time we would love to have breakfast there. 
Conclusion- if u want to save some money and ready to spend some time on the road to Center its prefect place to stay. 
Don’t forget to try Alexander’s tea – its in the right cupboard up and its really tasty!!))))

1189469,5528389,2013-07-04T00:00:00.000Z,Jorgen and Isabelle's apartment is beautifully furnished and centrally located. It is located in one of the best areas of Stockholm.

Gabriel was a great host and it was easy to contact him during our stay. We loved the bed (so comfy) and the shower was great - welcome after a long day's exploring the city! WiFi also very speedy. Note there isn't a tv - not that it bothered us in the slightest as we didn't want to waste time in exploring such an interesting city. I would happily recommend this apartment and would have no hesitation in booking again.  Thanks again Gabriel!"

Enjoyed the vegetarian breakfast and dinner with varied menu each day. Breakfast was even ready for me when I arrived in the morning. Vidhi took the trouble to prepare breakfast before my early morning departure. She and her husband are friendly and warm hosts who made me feel at home right away, and spent time to chat with me. With positive reviews, they both still continue to strive to provide great care to their guests. It's very clear that they are passionate and dedicated in what they do."

Wanted to please, and brought us nice bottle of wine, coffee, extra toilet paper, etc.  House is in great location, only 10 minutes walk to subway station.  Setting is nice, and we enjoyed seeing deer frolic in yard. Main floor is nice, open, well-lighted and comfortable.
Cons: Biggest con for seniors is steep, circular, narrow staircase Up/Down to access Bedrooms. Some things are well used (pots/pans/ovens) and need a more thorough cleaning, or replace. Cupboards should be better organized/less cluttered (for neat freaks like us :-)"
873383,187164957,2017-08-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Jag skrev till Isabelle dagen innan jag skulle komma men fick inget svar, inte via telefon eller airbnb. Under resdagen fick jag heller inge svar trots många försök, tillslut var jag helt enkelt tvungen att åka. När jag väl kommer fram så svarar hon inte, jag lyckas komma in i trapphuset tack vare en granne, det lyser i lägenheten men ingen öppnar eller svarar på något sätt. Jag kom fram i Stockholm kl 19.15. Jag ringde och smsade och tog till alla medel för att få tag i Isabelle men jag fick traska tillbaka till bilen med all packning. Min pappa ringde han också och tog till alla medel för att få tag i Isabelle, jag visste inte vad jag nu skulle göra och jag hade åkt en bra bit och det började bli kväll. Kl 20.04 fick pappa tag i hennes arbetskollega på något vis, de var på kräftskiva/fest och Isabelle hade glömt att jag skulle komma den dagen, hon trodde att jag skulle komma dagen efter. hennes telefon var på lagning. tillslut lyckas isabelle ringa mig via hennes arbetskollega. Det skulle ta 1 timma för henne att komma, hon skulle bara göra en sak för en vän först. jag satt i bilen fortfarande men isabelle erbjöd att grannarna kunde ta mig in sålänge, de kommer säkert bjuda på vodka sa hon, men jag sa nej för ärligt så kände jag mig inte bekväm, jag var trött men hade en god ton, tänkte att 1 timma kunde jag väl stå ut. Det tog 3 timmar. kl 21.50 skrev hon på air bnb att jag kunde börja gå mot henne. Dåligt. På fredagen skulle hon åka på semester och det var min sista natt, då kom en kille som \"soffsurfar\" och sov där. Det gick jag inte med på från början när jag ville sova hos henne. anledningen till att jag inte bytte hem var för att jag helt enkelt inte vågade med mera krångel, jag skulle jobba på mässan och skulle ändå inte vara hemma. Riktigt dåligt. Värst var de 3 timmar som jag fick  vänta i bilen."
438129,520791645,2019-08-31T00:00:00.000Z,Eva and her family were really nice and welcoming with me. The room is quite small and you can reach Stockholm center in 40 minutes.

It has everything you need to enjoy your stay - washing machine, iron, coffee machine and etc., that is not possible to have in the hotels. The building and area itself is really cool and calm!

What we enjoyed the most was the accomodation was just outside the city yet within  minutes of the public transport network, staying near the Älvsjö train junction eliminates waiting for trains to and from Stockholm. Facilities met our needs in every way, convenient stores close by, a great place from which to do day trips and a place to just chill out when your feet cannot take any more. Thanks H & K for making this a memorable experience."
1251466,7351476,2013-09-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Dean and Dace were very accommodating hosts. We had a little bit of problem getting to their place but overall stay was satisfactory.
The place was cozy and clean. Close to train station and it takes about 20 minutes to the city center. We stayed at Dean's place for two nights and Dace made us fresh mint tea on arrival. Our baggage didn't make it on time and Dace and Dean helped us get luggage the next day while we were sightseeing in the city.

The only advice to the next renter is to get the exact address. Dean said that he was going to meet us at the station. our roaming phone gave us problems so we could have just walked instead of waiting for pick up if I had known the exact address."
916806,79685263,2016-06-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Mansour's appartment is beautiful, very well presented and very clean and it had everything we needed. The area of the location itself is beautiful, with a stunning view of the lake from the terrace, which you can walk down to. There's a little beach, some BBQ areas and a forest that is great for exploring. The apartment is located in a very quiet housing area, and is very peaceful. However it is a good 20 minute metro ride to the centre, so take this into account if you want to be central. Overall we had a very enjoyable stay and although we didn't see Mansour he was a very helpful and welcoming host."

I arrived really late due to a delayed flight, and Edwin was so kind to stay up late just for me. The communication beforehand was very detailed; I had no problems finding my way to his flat and around the building. The room is bright, tidy and comfortable, and the whole flat is very clean and convenient. 

The location is great - there are just two stops by metro to the main station (where the airport bus also stops). Stockholm is a fairly small town, so you can easily walk to the main attractions, but different transport modes are within easy reach of the apartment. It is also located on top of a small mall, so you can shop for groceries within 30 seconds of leaving the flat. Shops and restaurants are also around the corner, as is a small market at the weekend.

All in all, it is a very good place to stay when in Stockholm, with Edwin being very considerate and helpful. Thank you again, Edwin!"

It is as shown on the pictures. Small but just right for a city trip, clean and very cute. The bathroom is very small, but also clean and ok for a few days once you get used to it. 

The location is perfect!! 3 mins walking to metro station Hornstull / 2 mins walking to a citybike station and a second one not far either / 3 mins walking to Hornstull Market - a must do on weekends / 3 mins to a small ICA supermarket / 2 metro stops to Slussen in the middle of everything / 5 mins bike ride to Hornstull beach. 

Klara was very nice and helpful before hand and also when we met personally at the check out. Everything went easy and comfortable. Thank you!"

Her apartment was within walking distance of many amazing restaurants and boutique shops, along with various parks.  We traveled with four kids, and  were able to explore the immediate neighborhood and venture to the more touristy areas (Gamla Stan, Djurgarden) with ease.  Emma was immediately responsive to any question or request, and made sure we were perfectly set up for our stay.  Her apartment was exceptionally clean and very comfortable for our family of six.  Located on the fourth floor, but with an elevator so easy to access."

916806,6004915,2013-07-26T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a wonderful stay at Mansour's Apartment. We liked the Location because it was very calm and we had the possibility to have the meals outside on the terrace, that was great. We thought the little \"manual\" how to handle everything (recycling, how to find the bus stop, etc.) very helpful. 
If you are looking for more than \"just\" a City trip, we can recommend this place very much."

The shower and kitchen are a bit tight but very functional.  The bed, a double, was fine for me but might be tight for a couple.  Mathis makes clear in his listing things that are not there, such as TV, microwave, wifi (but a USB is provided for laptop), so no surprises.  I was there for a month and found the apartment to be excellent."

While he was away teaching dance lessons in Berlin, my girlfriend and I had a great stay in one of his rooms. There was plenty of space for our stuff, a great balcony on which to eat, and all the cooking instruments needed. The Wifi password was a bit long (but secure!) but that's the only negative. The location of the place was great (near metro and major supermarkets + an easy walk to a park where you can walk into the water)."

Transport links are good with a 10 minute journey on the local train to Stockholm Central, there is also a direct train twice an hour to Arlanda Airport. The apartment has a stock of drinks and basic food stuffs. The bedroom and sitting room are both large and comfortable. I would highly recommend this apartment."

What we have experienced from the first moment that we met  EMMA and throughout the duration of our stay in this flat was wonderful. A real Lady, with a very warm reception, in a very beautiful, clean, with very nice decoration, modern and comfortable for our family of five persons, home. Very quiet building, in an ideal neighborhood, near to the GAMLA STAN, with very good transportation and with the most beautiful, modern and youthful bar-restaurants of STOCKHOLM. Our holidays in this city will be unforgettable and the main reason for this is that the choice of the flat was the best we could have done. For anyone who wants to start and finish his vacation in beautiful STOCKHOLM I recommend it unreservedly. We hope in the future that our choices on AIRBNB wil be so good.     VALUE FOR MONEY 10."

Maud ist eine sehr nette und herzliche Gastgeberin, die sich sehr über das Wohl ihrer Gäste bemüht. Außerdem ist sie stets hilfsbereit und man kann allgemein gute Gespräche führen.

278311,19047383,2014-09-05T00:00:00.000Z,"It was a real pleasure staying at Linnea’s place; the flat is located at a quiet residential area in south Stockholm within a very short walking distance from the Farsta Strand train station and is close to shops and other amenities. But that is not as important as many would think (though it clearly is an added plus!); what matters is that the place is a haven of friendliness and of calm energy. I had a string of extremely busy days in Stockholm during my booking, but always knew that the stress and pressure would go away as soon as I entered the flat and enjoyed some tea at the kitchen area or talked a bit with Linnea’s lovely family - big and small – that resided in one of the other rooms. The topics varied from the merits of fivefinger running shoes to barista ordering techniques, Swedish school curricula, Albanian dialects, welfare state reform, philosophy and life in Sweden in general… All in all, a positive experience at a place and with people that I could not recommend enough!"

They have everything I need in the house and made me like at home. The apartment is so well connected with the city center by metro. And the neighbourhood is quiet and very beautiful. The room is cozy and tidy with a big bed. I really love Stockholm and the stay with Vidi's family. I highly recommend this apartment and will definitely come to stay longer next time.
Vidi的公寓离市中心有一段距离,但是走路3分钟就可以到地铁站,地铁可以很方便地到达所有你想去的地方｡公寓附近的景色非常美,有时间的话可以在周围转转,绝对不会失望｡一家人都很好客,非常好相处,Vidi还做了印度早餐,很愉快的经历｡"

Si tratta di un B&B bello, abbastanza curato e funzionale. La camera è fornita di tutti i confort necessari per mettere gli ospiti a proprio agio e a renderli pienamente autonomi. E’ collocato in una posizione strategica col il valore aggiunto che la proprietaria Lidia è una persona molto disponibile, gentile e di ottima compagnia. Lidia ci ha dato tanti consigli su come muoversi a Stoccolma. La posizione è ottima, a pochi passi dalla stazione di Sodra che permette di arrivare ovunque.
Lo consigliamo e ci ritorneremo sicuramente."

The heating felt great in very cold weather and the bed was comfy as well. I did not cook much but it is possible if you need to. She provides bags of tea and various kitchen products that make it easy for you. It was a secure building and convenient to get around with public transportation. Would recommend to a friend!

Communication with Edwin was easy and he always replied fast and very informative.
He gave me very good description how to find his apartment and also enough tips about Stockholm.
I felt very welcomed during my stay. The location is also perfect! It is very close to downtown area. And I could get easily to all the attractions by walk. The apartment has everything you need. I definitely recommend it!
cheers//"

581243,29254033,2015-04-06T00:00:00.000Z,Edwin was really nice and friendly. He explained everything in the house and where we can find everything in the city.  His place was clean and central. Highly recommended.
819676,273412487,2018-06-06T00:00:00.000Z,Had a great stay in Stockholm at Andy & Vannie's place! Loved having my own bathroom and the apartment was very centrally located. Would stay there again!!
954832,86089053,2016-07-14T00:00:00.000Z,"We loved our stay in Stockholm! Mikael was incredibly responsive and helpful even before our trip as we had some questions in advance of our trip about restaurants and other things. He also had recommendations for spas as I contacted him at the mid point of our two week trip while we were in Oslo and needed a massage. :) 

The location was great because it was in a quiet area away from the tourists and super close to public transit which made it very easy to get anywhere in the city. 

The little kitchen was perfect for us as we hit the grocery store as soon as we arrived so that we could make breakfasts and have snacks and night caps. 

The bed was comfy and we had everything we needed to make it our Stockholm home away from home for a week. 

Thanks for everything, Mikael! It was a pleasure meeting you!"
1124388,6660264,2013-08-20T00:00:00.000Z,"The flat is very convenient situated in Stockholm, just 15 minutes bus ride from Main Station. Also night service is provided. The bus stop is nearby, as well as a small grocery shop. We recommend a  walk to the nearby island Kungsholmen along the water and Ralambhovspark.

Carl was very flexible for check-in and chek-out time. We appreciated the fully equipped kitchen with some breakfast items plus possibility to cook our meals in some occasions since we don't always want to eat out. Some minor problem with Bathroom lamp was quickly solved.

We also found his book collection really interesting! Wi-fi worked perfectly.

The bed size was nevertheless a bit on the lower limit. Though, there's an extra bed available, which we didn't use. Bathroom is very compact, typical swedish. Towels were available. 

I highly recommend it for an urban holiday in Stockholm!"
1271843,10396795,2014-02-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Stop looking for a place. You are in the right spot. Great host, very well located, clean, tidy and confortable. What else could you ask for?

278311,66302511,2016-03-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Linnéa was a fantastic host. I was staying for a few days with the intention of cramming in as much of Stockholm as I could. The apartment is in a great location. It's a really short work to the Metro as well as the beautiful lake (which was covered in a layer of snow on the first day of Spring!). The bed looked comfy and I can attest that it's even better than it looks. Towels and basic toiletries were a nice touch, though I didn't partake it was greatly appreciated and I imagine will be invaluable to those travelling light. She was also kind enough to offer breakfast (which I foolishly didn't realise and didn't make very much use of). Though I didn't see much of my hosts, they were kind and gracious to my comings and goings. Definitely beats a boring hotel! I just wish I could have stayed longer and chatted more."

El apartamento está en perfecto estado, con un montón de facilidades, en un barrio céntrico, cómodo y con muchos restaurantes y comercios a su alrededor. Definitivamente recomendable para unos días en Estocolmo y cuando vuelva, voy a repetir."

She helped us before we arrived with very good tips regarding public transport and time schedules and gave us lots of leaflets and tips to explore the city. The room was very cosy and the bed really comfortable. The location is just great, 2 minutes from Soedra Station. We will definitely visit Lidia again."

The room was clean, big enough. Alexandre is sleeping on the couch in the living room, No problem with that 
NIce place to stay"
822497,14113330,2014-06-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Moa's place was very clean, modern, and comfortable. It's situated in a very residential area, about 20 min metro ride from the central station; trains run every 7 minutes during rush hour and less frequently in the evening. The metro station is about 5 mins walk from the place. There's also a bus station right around the corner, which is very convenient if you don't want to go through city center for all your activities. 

Moa left us plenty of space in the closet and refrigerator which helped us feel at home immediately. Check in and check out was very easy and her local shopping and dining recommendations were also helpful. There's a grocery store right next to the place, so we were able to cook up a nice breakfast before heading out each day. 

The only concern for us were her beds. Her beds are all on the soft side, so if you prefer firm beds, it may be uncomfortable. Also, the bed in the small bedroom is not a full double bed (little smaller than a US full size) so it's better for petite adults and children if you wanna have two people stay together. 

All in all it was a very pleasant stay and I would recommend Moa's place to friends who visit Stockholm in the future."
1244357,483117254,2019-07-07T00:00:00.000Z,"My parents and I had a great time at Elliott and Rebecca’s flat. My parents are a bit older so that it is on the first floor is much appreciated as they have had trouble with stairs in other buildings in Stockholm in the past. The location is great, the flat had everything we needed, and checkin and checkout was made very easy! Thanks for having us."
1251466,68388729,2016-04-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Dean is a great host. He offered us to pick us up from the metro station and welcomed us very friendly. He has a nice flat, though it is a bit far from the city Centre, but it is close to the metro station. We can totally recommend it, it is a nice place to stay."
708979,188053733,2017-08-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Schöne Unterkunft mit bester Anbindung per U-Bahn ins Zentrum. Nette Kommunikation und ganz wichtig: eine Wohnung, die tatsächlich bewohnt wird und nur temporär vermietet wird, also nicht - nach meinem Eindruck- als Touristenapartment zweckentfremdet wird.
Nice accommodation with best connection by subway to the center. Nice communication and very important: an apartment, which is actually inhabited and only temporarily rented, so is not - according to my impression - as a tourist apartment is misused."
274876,287343256,2018-07-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Our family of five (kids 2.5, 8, 11) really enjoyed our 8 day stay at Emma’s flat. It is centrally located in a quiet residential area (we left the windows open at night), with easy access to bus and ferry, yet only ages short blocks away from fantastic cafes and shops. Emma greeted us as the flat and left us with helpful advice, welcome treats and a fully stocked kitchen. The flat has anything you could think to need. The beds were very comfy and the apartment very bright and cheery. Do keep in mind this is Emma’s home, so there isn’t anywhere to hang clothing, but we managed just fine out of our suitcases. Absolutely loved our time in Stockholm and our stay in Emma’s flat."
1035775,17043716,2014-08-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Our stay in Stockholm was absolutely lovely and Magnus was a big reason we had such a positive experience. His apartment was the perfect size for a couple, with a great kitchen for cooking and a wonderful balcony for enjoying our meals. The location of the apartment (on the island of Kungsholmen) was very convenient for travel throughout all of Stockholm via both bus and metro. Magnus was very communicative with us before, during and even after our stay. He was quick to answer emails and provide us with thoughtful answers to our queries and during our stay we communicated via WhatsUp for any other questions we had. Magnus was a superb host and we would stay in his flat again in a heartbeat!"

Coretta was nice, she invited me to dinner with a group of international expats in Stockholm, which was very nice. I had of lovely evening."
533880,23646839,2014-12-07T00:00:00.000Z,Jarl is a very caring person and acts with a great deal of hospitality. He makes you feel that his home is your home. The room is fresh and the bathroom is just outside the room. The area is quite and still just a short walk from city centre.

1153177,279263143,2018-06-20T00:00:00.000Z,Terry is one of the best Airbnb superhost we have ever encountered. Superb hospitality (thanks for the welcome breakfast) and caring responses.

Annika tok godt i mot oss og rommet var helt topp for oss to. Deilig å ha mulighet til å lage frokost og enkel mat selv. Mange vinduer og en liten veranda som gir godt lys og muligheter for lufting."

385701,93702499,2016-08-13T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a wonderful holiday in Alex house - we loved the spatially complex and wonderful house, especially the double height dining space. The kids loved playing in the quiet and green pedestrian way in front of the door. The location was just perfect for exploring Stockholm and the surrounds, a short drive to the coast and to the lakes.
Unfortunately we were not able to meet Alex and his family in person. Communication was great at all times, very friendly and reply quick at all times. Alex is very welcoming, friendly and helpful. We thoroughly enjoyed his recommendations for the neighbourhood and Stockholm.
The house and kitchen are very well equipped, especially for a family with children.
We had an excellent time and hope to visit again in the future. Thanks a lot Alex for having us stay, regards Hedwig"
1261445,70768742,2016-04-20T00:00:00.000Z,"We really loved staying in Marie-Louise's apartment. We were greeted by her daughter Bianca who was very helpful in showing us around and spoke great English. It was very kind of them to also get some food in for us, we really appreciated the gesture after travelling, a real treat. The apartment was just gorgeous and very true to the images on here. It had a lovely cosy feeling and we looked forward to spending the evenings there after long days exploring Stockholm. A real home from home. I was sad to leave it! It wasn't too far from the Hornstull tube station and the supermarket either. There is a lift as well which is welcome after long days walking!!! It was a quiet and relaxed neighbourhood and I loved hearing the gentle church bells from over the road too. I highly recommend this apartment and will always treasure our time spent in Stockholm. Thanks Marie-Louise!"

It was a great way to begin my time in the city. The apartment is really nice and so is Nettan. She was always helpful and friendly and I felt I could use the apartment on equal terms with her, which was nice especially during the evenings. The apartment is really nicely located close to Gärdet, which is a big park, and not far from the city center. I can only recommend staying with Nettan if you are visiting Stockholm."

The Mariatorget part of Sodermalm is the perfect part of town to stay in and feel right at home, close to everything you'd need and a straight shot to the airport. Mallika was so easy to get in touch with and everything was just as we needed. Would stay again!"

Hanna's apartment is conveniently located just 10 minutes from the center (central station). It is located in a residence on the edge of a large park that will delight families with children or just sports. Children's games are in front of the window, the train station to the center and a grocery store in 3 minutes. The apartment is spacious and warm, Hanna has not forgotten for the comfort of its guests, it feels like home ... In addition, she met us at the foot of the bus that took us from the airport to take us to the apartment, avoiding us to seek our way arriving in a strange country. It was also thought to leave some groceries in the cupboards and the fridge!
We spent a wonderful week of vacation and all we highly recommend this address. You can not be disappointed!
Thank you Hanna!

206221,2062757,2012-08-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Elisabeth added another dimension to our stay in Stockholm with her many stories and insight into both her life and Stockholm. She was a gracious and warm host and her place is neat and full of character.

The location of this room is good, situated in the middle of Sodermalm, where there are plenty of trendy restaurants, cafes and bars around, despite the quiet street the flat is actually on. It is a 10 minute walk from Gamla Stan and a 15-20 minute walk from the city centre.

The room and bathroom were spacious and is suitable for up to 2 guests. Elisabeth also provided a very nice breakfast. Although the facilities were shared, Elisabeth was very discrete and respected privacy. This place does not have wifi. However, this was not too much of an issue because of the short walking distances around Stockholm. Elisabeth was kind enough to research information about getting around Stockholm, weather etc on our behalf when requested.

Highly recommend Elisabeth's room for one or two travellers."

L’appartement est parfait (très propre, décoré avec goût, très équipé et fonctionnel) dans une belle résidence très calme. La rue est aussi très calme. Nous avons adoré le quartier : chouettes boutiques, de décoration notamment, restaurant, café... C’est d’ailleurs le quartier que nous avons préféré. 
Bref si je devais retourner à Stockholm j’irai chez Sanna et je le recommanderais à mon entourage ( ce que j’ai déjà d’ailleurs fait hier à mon voisin en lui parlant de mon séjour en Suède).

We were in a great location, central to everything and an easy walk to Gamla Stan, the centre of town and the Vasa Museum. Martin's friend Julia was there to greet us at the station and show us up to the apartment. She also gave us a nice introduction to the area. The bed was small for 2 people to sleep side by side but there was another mattress which we made room for on the floor by moving the coffee table aside. Martin was available to contact at anytime and was a generous host with fruit, chocolate and fresh towels available for us on arrival."

I can thoroughly recommend the entire experience and Peter's apartment as a comfortable, clean and friendly place to stay!"

954832,235611434,2018-02-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Mikael was really friendly, informative and greeted us upon arrival with his warm hospitality. A cosy apartment to stay in."
757320,14077435,2014-06-11T00:00:00.000Z,Barb was very welcoming and friendly! We had an appropriate amount of privacy and full use of the kitchen. The location was perfect: easy walk to gamla stan and also the rest of stockholm. The only downside is that the window faces a busy street so if you are a light sleeper bring ear plugs. Definitely recommend!
1151217,5844436,2013-07-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Simply perfect - the apartment, its location, and last but not least, the contact wirh Anna (she wasn't there, however, she had thought about everything).  Thank you, Anna, we'll come back."
900043,62033473,2016-02-10T00:00:00.000Z,Bra och trevlig boende med toppenläge. Fungerade perfekt med nycklar och allt!
1182616,255996473,2018-04-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Peter's place is ideally located only a couple of minutes walk from the Fridhemsplan metro station, which made commuting around Stockholm a breeze! Peter had left us travel cards (which can be used on metro/bus/ferries etc) which we just topped up (cheapest option was the 72 hours for 250 Krona) and explored! Some fab local places to eat and walking along the coastal paths was beautiful. Went for morning runs along the water's edge - a whole lap of the island Fridhemsplan sits on is 9km ... a fab way to start the day! Peter is very responsive to any messages sent and made our stay effortless. Thank you!"
1182616,472305081,2019-06-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Peter's place is really convenient.

However, when we arrived we realised that the sheets were not changed because there were still crumbs on the bed. We had to dust it off ourselves.

We also had to share the toilet and kitchen with 4 other persons; so you can imagine the long wait to wash up in the mornings. 

Finally, on the day that we were checking out, we were told that the time to check out is 12pm. But at 9am, a new group of people opened our room door and asked if we were leaving."
1182616,289812174,2018-07-13T00:00:00.000Z,Great host
581243,15564782,2014-07-11T00:00:00.000Z,Edwin seemed like a nice guy. The room was clean and tidy. I booked it the same day and he didn't mind at all. Good communication.
472015,5584527,2013-07-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Great location, close to metro station and short walk to Gamla Stan.  The apartment was exactly as described and very comfortable."
581243,6135000,2013-07-31T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin was super helpful and answered any of my questions effortlessly. Great central location, next to T Bana and grocery store, above a shopping mall. What more could you ask for? Definitely recommended to stay here!"
299154,30556887,2015-04-24T00:00:00.000Z,Thank you Daniel for sharing your place. It was very convenient and is located near bus stops and train station. We were able to check in early too. Thank you for meeting us even though you were not feeling well.
1182616,8026559,2013-10-13T00:00:00.000Z,My husband and I stayed at Peter's place for one night. It was a great location with few min walk to the Metro station and about 20 min walk to central station. Room was very clean with good space for two persons and a balcony. Peter was friendly and very flexible with check-in/out.
795354,6985634,2013-09-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Gustav was very hospitable, it was like staying at your friends place. Great location, spacious home, and you won't need a gym membership, it's on the 4th floor and no elevator.  :)"
206221,1216898,2012-05-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Elisabeth is very kind and friendly. Her apartment is very pleasant and close to the city center. Room is big, there are more than enough space for 2 persons. The breakfast was very rich and tasty. We had a great time and we recommend it ! Thanks again for all!"
442837,96034529,2016-08-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Jo's apartment was perfect! Very easy to find and Jo met me in Leljeholmen square to walk to the flat (2 minutes). Communication was great and the room is fine and very comfortable.
The location is amazing and couldn't be closer to the metro line with the main city only a few stops away. Liljeholmen itself is very cool with a big mall that the apartment is attached to which is great for shopping. 
I'd highly recommend staying with Jo, she's really friendly and was able to help with questions I had about Stockholm and the local area."
533880,7448477,2013-09-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Great experience overall. The location of the apartment is easy to find and get around from. The room is spacious, clean, well-equipped and very comfortable. The bathroom is not large but again well-equipped, practical and comfortable. The kitchen is also well-equipped and convenient. Everything in the house works properly and Jarl lets you use the kitchen equipment, provides towels etc. (he even gave me detergent for the laundry) Aside from the material qualities of the accomodations, Jarl is a great host and a generous man who is always keen to keep his guests happy. He is always ready provide assistance when needed, both regarding how things work around the house and how things work in Stockholm in general. My 4-night stay at Jarl's place was extremely comfortable and I would recommend the room to anyone traveling to Stockholm."
700113,252601400,2018-04-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Ilona's place is a wonderful studio with everything you need to enjoy a lovely stay in Stockholm. You can easily walk from the studio to explore the city, or take the subway, everything feels very near. The place is exactly what it looks like in the pictures. The kitchen is good for basic cooking. Ilona is a very kind host, always prepared to help out or give any information you might need. Thank you!"
581243,210045157,2017-11-07T00:00:00.000Z,Mycket bra

242188,97096905,2016-08-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia was a magnificent host. She replied to all my questions immediately and 1 week before arrival time, she sent me the perfect instructions on getting to her home. We took the train directly from the airport to her Stockholm Sodra stop, it was perfect and easy. It took a little less than an hour. If you have any questions about the trains at the airport, at Terminal 4 there is an information center - you can also buy the train ticket there. We bought a 7 day travel card because we were there 9 days - we used it good. There is an additional 85 Kr (~$10) fee to get on this commuter train from the airport but it was worth it.

My parents joined me on my trip. I got the single room and my parents got one of the double rooms. I didn't know there were 2 double rooms, the other one has 2 separate twin beds. All 3 rooms share the bathroom. At first, I thought this would be a problem but it never was.

My single room was spacious enough and faced the playground. Noise-wise, you can hear the kids playing, no biggie, noise doesn't start till 8 am. At night time, you hear the people talking but it stops around 11-11:30 pm, no later.

I really loved the neighborhood. If I ever go back, I'd stay in that area again. It was accessible to everything. The buses and trains were all nearby. So are the restaurants and parks. You  can walk to Gamla Stan if you want to check out the area - about 1.5 miles from her home. I felt safe at all times. Lidia's suggestions/guidance was very helpful and valuable. She's very nice and you can tell she enjoys being a host. My parents really enjoyed her company too, especially during breakfast. My parents wanted breakfast every morning so they paid to get it. She offered bread, cheeses, prosciutto, ham, fruits, jam and more. I provided my own breakfast since I have a sensitive stomach.

Lidia is very enjoyable and easy to speak with. I highly recommend her."
757320,526779200,2019-09-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice and clean apartment near to city center. Barb was nice and her dog also, but unfortunately we had different sense of humor so we didn't talk much."
1204621,16427631,2014-07-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Nettan was a really nice host, very helpful and friendly, and for reasons already described by previous reviewers, her room and apartment were wonderful to stay in, so I will just add something about the great location: roughly a 5-minute walk to the metro station, a 1-minute walk to the grocery store, and a 2-minute jog to to a park area with jogging paths in various directions, including down to and along the waterside, which I found really beautiful. So I would definitely be very happy if I could stay at Nettan's place again the next time I visit Stockholm."
164448,411065942,2019-02-11T00:00:00.000Z,It is a very warm and clean flat with adorable design and convenient bathing facility. Li is very hospitable and willing to help. It locates in a very quiet community with convenient public transportation nearby.
299154,30949702,2015-04-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Daniel was great, I arrived early afternoon and he made it possible for me to get into the flat and leave my bags.  All the information was available from login details to places to eat.  Great response to questions and sms.  The flat is very central, walking distance from Gamlastan and located in the middle of a very vibrant Sodermalm.  Excellent choice, can recommend the place and would stay here again!"

164448,129357658,2017-01-30T00:00:00.000Z,"I definitely reccomend staying at Lidia's and I will surely go back there if I ever go to Stockholm again!
Lidia is absolutely lovely, very welcoming, helpful and smiling! She waited for us until late in the night and she carefully explained everything about the main spots of the city and trasports so that we would be ready and well prepared the next day (she gave us also maps and brochures).
She lives in the same apartment but in a separate part of the house so you will have your own privacy. The bathroom is shared with other two rooms but there was never the need to queue.
Our room (good size for two people) and the whole house was clean, warm and cosy. Even though the breakfast was not included, coffee and tea were always there for us, kindly offered by the host. 
There is a fridge, microwave, kettle, cutlery and plates to warm up or store your own food, as well as a common room where to eat. There is wifi.
The location of the house is very good:
- nice and quiet area
- 2 minutes walking from the train station (black line J) which connects directly to Stockholm Central  in around 5 minutes where you can catch the metro with the same ticket. Trains pass very often...we have never waited more than 10-15 minutes 
- 700 metres from the nearest metro station (in case you don't want to change from metro to trains)
- 2 minutes walking from the nearest supermarket 
- 25 minutes walking from the old town"
1182616,128259982,2017-01-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Nous avons passé un très bon moment dans l'appartement de Peter. 
Nous pouvons arriver à n'importe quelle heure , ça ne pose pas de problème . L'appartement est très bien desservi par les transports en communs mais surtout tout est faisable à pied avec de bonnes chaussures !!! 
La chambre est très agréable avec son balcon privé , il y a une grande cuisine commune. Les autres parties communes sont très correctes ! 
L'immeuble n'est pas bruyant et le lit est très confortable (ce qui est non négligeable après une grosse journée de marche à pied) 

Je recommande fortement ce logement de très bon rapport qualité/emplacement/prix!"
1234960,17960121,2014-08-19T00:00:00.000Z,We had a very pleasant stay at Jacob's place. He is a very friendly and helpful person. Everything was arranged when we arrived and he even brought beer and breakfast for the next morning! The neighbourhood is very peaceful and it is about 15 minutes to the city centre ( Subway is 5 minutes walk). We would really recommend this place if you want to stay in Stockholm.
1144069,37558644,2015-07-08T00:00:00.000Z,"We enjoyed our stay at Jon's place. As soon as we walked in my family and I felt at home. Our young daughter even called it home. Everything was clean, well organized and functional, the kitchen had everything we needed. We didn't meet Jon but he ensured a friend was there to greet us and answer our questions. This would be my preferred place to stay if I am ever in Stockholm again. Thanks Jon!"
1204621,198721044,2017-09-30T00:00:00.000Z,Nettan was a great host! Everything worked perfectly and she was always willing to help with anything she could.

The flat is beautiful and very clean. We didn't met Annika in person, but she was a lovely host! I would definitely come back to this place:)"
368952,43650248,2015-08-21T00:00:00.000Z,A friend and I spent two nights at Madeleines house and felt welcome. She has a very cosy an comfortable place. We were allowed to help ourselfes and she even invited us to have a bbq with her.  I would definetely recommend staying at her place!

Peter was always nice, attentive and available for anything that we needed, providing a safe and enjoyable trip. 
The only thing less positive was the cleaning of the bathroom and room floor. 

Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely recommend it! 
Thanks Peter!"
299154,8193247,2013-10-20T00:00:00.000Z,"I totally agree with all the positive reviews of Daniel's flat. We had a really lovely, comfortable stay there. The location is perfect, very central yet quiet and relaxing. The apartment is small and cosy and just right for two people. The kitchen is well-equipped, so you can easily save some money by cooking there. Daniel is friendly, helpful and generous and he gets a big thumbs-up."
581243,407178432,2019-02-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin is a great host. He is welcoming, quick to respond and offers helpful practical information about the apartment, Stockholm, and how to navigate public transportation. The accommodation is clean, tidy, and quiet. And it's easy to reach. I had a positive experience during my short stay, and would recommend the listing to a friend."

274876,179996943,2017-08-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Lovely, clean apartment in great, residential neighborhood of \"happening\" Sodermalm. We were traveling with our 4 children, so the space was just a wee bit tight - but not my much. Emma was very responsive and accommodating and seemed happy to be sharing her home (she even let us eat her ice cream!). Was an excellent location for a family - nearby parks, easy walks, QUIET at night. Bus to ferry + walking to Djurgarden was about 20-30 minutes. Not a problem for us and we quite enjoyed the walks. Two quirks to know about: no coffee machine (at least that we were able to find - but great cafes very close by!), and no drawer or closet space for your clothes -  (this is still Emma's home so all of her family's items in place). Would certainly return."

822497,8920546,2013-11-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Moa has a lovely apartment in a great neighbourhood that is easy to get to and from. 

She was super helpful by providing lots of maps and ideas of where to spend time in Stockholm and was always available for any questions we had. 

Being a 2 minute walk from the tram (i.e. underground/subway) is really convenient, it takes you everywhere you need to be in the city. 

Stockholm is beautiful and you will absolutely love it. 

If in Stockholm, seriously consider staying at Moa's, it's perfect in every sense of the way."

Kort vei til hyggelige restauranter og til to av mine favorittbutikker i Stockholm: Wibergs foto med stort utvalg i brukte kameraer, og High Fidelity, stedet for musikkinteresserte"
164448,108218170,2016-10-15T00:00:00.000Z,Lidias Wohnung ist super gelegen und war genau wie in der Beschreibung und den Fotos angegeben. Sie hat sich Zeit genommen uns über verschiedene Sehenswürdigkeiten und Ausflugsmöglichkeiten zu informieren - das war sehr nett!

The area is great; filled with bars, cafes and independent shops. The appartment is not too far from the metro; making travelling around the city easy."
164448,101932070,2016-09-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia's place was very comfortable and homey. There was a lot of privacy, as we were on the second floor and had access to a separate bathroom as well as numerous other helpful amenities. The first day we were there, Lidia voluntarily gave us a 20 - minute review of Stockholm's highlights, attractions, and activities. She was available whenever we needed help, always with a smile and ready laugh. We had our own key, which was useful. The place is near a school, so in the mornings, we heard children laughing from the nearby school :) A great stay with a warm host!"

Su casa está a escasos 30 m. de la parada de autobús que lleva a la estación central, y a cuatro o cinco minutos de la entrada al metro, así que esta muy bien comunicada.
Además Alí, el día de partida que teníamos una hora de salida complicada (La 1h 30' de la mañana), estuvo despierto por si necesitábamos algo, y el día de antes me indicó el número de autobus que teníamos que coger, y me acompaño hasta la parada.
Todo muy bien. En la casa entre el día , no estabamos, porque saliamos a ver cosas, y solo estuvimos para dormir y para desayunar, así que sobre eso no puedo comentar nada.
En general salvo un mal entendido por nuestra parte sobre el tipo de comida que podíamos utilizar (que no tuvo ninguna repercusión porque respetamos sus costumbres y no nos afectó en nada porque enfrente hay un supermercado, y compramos alimentos sin cerdo) todo muy bien."

819676,416289669,2019-02-24T00:00:00.000Z,The perfect Airbnb for 1-2 people and the PERFECT location! Vanessa and Andy were even headed away for the weekend and allowed my friend and I to stay in the apartment on our own.  Access to their Guest Netflix was a plus on nights that we ended early.

478105,33762371,2015-06-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Herr Wigardt war bei der Wohnungsübernahme kurz anwesend und hat div. Empfehlungen abgegeben und sich bereit erklärt für weitere Anfragen telefonisch zur Verfügung zu stehen.

Die Wohnung liegt in einem ruhigen Vorort von Stockholm. Die Blicke aus den Fenstern gehen ins Grüne, was sehr angenem ist.

Die Wohnung war bei der Übernahme sehr verschmutzt (am Boden war Lurch, Betten, insbesondere Matratzen, dicke Staubschicht auf den Möbeln und Sesseln, Geschirr etc.). Ein Raum konnte wegen der extremen Verschmutzung der Betten nicht benützt werden, daher wurden Matratzenauflagen verwendet um ein \"Bett\" am Boden des Wohnzimmers zu schaffen. Man hatte subjektiv den Eindruck die Bettwäsche eines Bettes wurde nach dem Vorbenützer nicht gewechselt. Wir hatten vorher noch nie eine derart verschmutzt Unterkunft erlebt. Bei der Anwesenheit von Herrn Wigardt gleich beim Einzug war das Ausmaß der Verunreinigung noch nicht abzusehen, wir waren sozusagen überrumpelt.

Die Balkone waren unverwendbar (verschmutzte Liegestühle).

Das Free-WIFi hat nicht funktioniert."

O apartamento é super bem localizado, praticamente na porta de saída de uma estação do metrô e a hospitalidade do Edwin foi espetacular. O espaço estava sempre muito limpo e organizado. Além disso, o Edwin ainda nos permitiu usar a cozinha do apartamento, o que facilitou muito os nossos dias em Estocolmo. Detalhe: há um shopping com supermercado no mesmo prédio do apartamento, o que ajuda ainda mais a se abastecer para os dias em Estocolmo, onde  o preço das refeições é relativamente alto. Resumindo: estadia perfeita!!"

Ilona was also very accommodating where by terrible flight schedule was concerned (with flight delays and a late arrival). Would definitely consider staying here if I drop by Stockholm again.
954832,299660636,2018-07-31T00:00:00.000Z,"Appartement très bien situé. Il est fonctionnel et lumineux. 
Nous avons apprécié l'accueil et la gentillesse de Mikael qui s'est montré arrangeant . Nous avions toutes les informations nécessaires pour passer un excellent séjour. 
(à noter cependant que l'appartement ne dispose pas de doubles rideaux  ce qui peut être gênant en été car le soleil se couche très tard et se lève tôt.). 
Rien à dire de plus. Nous recommandons cette appartement."

Told us a few things about the flat that we should know, which was helpful and then left us to our own devices to enjoy the place.

The space was wonderfully neat and clean, aesthetically pleasing, all your needs in one---and exactly what I needed!  The location was convenient to the city center using the metro or bus, and Vidhatri was very helpful about providing exact instructions on how to get to their apartment from the airport, and anywhere else I wanted to go. They are an exceptionally nice mannered, openhanded and helpful family. They are so helpfuly, they accompanied us all the way to the airport, unluckily the trains were stopped on our way to the airport, they helped us reached the airport on time.
I highly recommend staying with Vidhatri and her family and plan on doing so again when I return to Stockholm in the future."

 Right before we arrived Andre's place, we were terribly disappointed with our airbnb experience in London despite of the fact the host in London has over seventy five 5 star reviews.  

Staying at Andre's place restored our faith in airbnb again.  Andre is a true SuperHost and he deserves more than 5 stars!  I highly recommend Andre's place! He is a 10 star host!"

The double room has 2 single beds that can be pushed together for couples or separated for 2 friends sharing.  The communal area has fridge and kettle etc so you can get a takeout or breakfast/lunch items and have a place to put these in order to keep your costs down.  Metro is just around the corner so it was no problems getting around with luggage.

The location and proximity to the local T station is really a huge plus. The room itself is on the smaller side and this is a reflection of the building being quite historic.

Martin was very accommodating and even let us drop off our bags early. He offered plenty of local recommendations and was quick with communication. Highly recommended!
313763,449750278,2019-05-07T00:00:00.000Z,Martin was a very helpful host. The room in his classy appartment was the perfect homebase for my city exploration trip.

916806,141155720,2017-04-02T00:00:00.000Z,This was a great apartment. There was a beautiful view and only a short walk to the train station. Very convenient! Julia was an amazing host that provided me with a lot of information on transportation and the local area. She had a self check in service that was extremely convenient.
916806,164488030,2017-06-27T00:00:00.000Z,Nice and clean small space. Lovely decl to sit in the sun. Short drive to waters edge for a nice walk in nature. We had a car while here so about a 20minite drive to Stockholm and 5 minutes to nearest shopping centre. Not much to do in area but good base to travel out from. Julia was very responsive to our questions and lots of detailed information.
1250227,155110598,2017-05-27T00:00:00.000Z,En perfekt lägenhet med charm och ett lugnt men ändå centralt läge. Idealiskt för ett par.
624886,2455495,2012-09-30T00:00:00.000Z,"The perfect place for a family to enjoy Stockholm. It's hard to over-praise Oskar's place - we (two kids, two adults) had a fantastic week there. It's in a quieter part of hip Sodermalm but v near to both the Tunnelbana and a kid's playground. The flat is really stylishly done up - we wanted to move in oursevles. And best of all they were lots of great toys and books for our kids to play with. There's probably Stockholm's best Indian restaurant next door and for me a great vinyl shop just a few blocks away as well as the city and SoFo just a few metro stops away. Oskar was extremely helpful, sending us great tips on what to do (Djurgarden and the barnas rom at Kulturhuset are musts) and greeting us when we arrived. There was place for a pram downstairs, the lift was a great hit, and Oskar provided a travel cot for our youngest. All in all, a great stay and we were really sad to leave."
1212891,513939475,2019-08-20T00:00:00.000Z,"My sister and I had a lovely stay at Maud's place! The room is exactly as described and the location is great too - just a few stops from the city centre, in a safe neighbourhood. Maud does her best so that her guests enjoy their stay and Sammy, her cat, is the most lovable being. If you like cats, he will make this visit one to remember. There is also a supermarket nearby and the area is quite quiet at night, which is a bonus. If we ever go back to Stockholm, we'll stay with them again."
1189469,482186715,2019-07-06T00:00:00.000Z,I would recommend this apartment because it is convenient located in close proximity to the old town center gamla stan (10-15 min by foot) and surrounded by a park. Additional you have shopping facilities. The apartment was clean and has a very modern and stylish furniture. There was everything you needed and very special things too such as a piano. It is a place to relax and it conveys a homey feeling.
1271843,55317095,2015-11-29T00:00:00.000Z,"André and Joanne are really nice, very friendly and helpful hosts! :) their apartment is very cosy and clean, very comfortable room and bed, conveniently located (very close to the metro station and in a nice neighborhood close to the city center).

274876,317528785,2018-09-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Our stay with Emma was outstanding. The initial communications where informative and accurate. She even gave us a few hints for local eateries. The check—
in was a self check-in, but with her instructions where very easy.  The apartment itself is in a perfect location to discover the city and just a 15 min walk to Galma Stan. The flat is on the 4th floor, but there is an elevator. Our initial impression when walking in, was the space being immaculate, homey, and very well designed and thought through. It is her apartment and like others have stated there isn’t much closet space but that’s not really an issue. To make this stay over the top, Emma even left some food for us to have breakfast the next day, including milk as she knew we where coming to stay with a baby. She also had a crib all set up for us as well. One of the best stays through this app we have ever had. Was a true pleasure."
819676,286967559,2018-07-07T00:00:00.000Z,"I would definitely recommend Andy & Vannie’s place.  It was very clean and the private bathroom was fantastic.  Andy & Vannie’s place also includes good wifi, a television, a small fridge, tea and coffee making facilities and lots of helpful information.  The apartment is in Södermalm and quite close to Gamla Stan, which was perfect for my visit to Stockholm.  Andy & Vannie were very friendly and provided lots of local tips.  They also went out of their way to enable early check-in so that I didn’t need to find somewhere to store my luggage for the day."
442837,18031202,2014-08-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Jo was a super great host!  Her location is just right outside of Stockholm, but getting there is super easy.  The room was clean and it was a really safe area.  There are all sorts of transportation options, including trains and buses just right outside her doorstep.  There is also a great bike program where you can rent a bike for 3 days and it is supper easy to bike all over Stockholm.  Jo was super friendly, she provided an awesome map of the city and had great ideas and suggestions on how you should spend your time there.  Her condo is super secure and its really up to date."
581243,36647902,2015-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin was very nice and his place was very clean.  When we arrived he explained everything to us.  Best of all was that it was conveniently located near buses, subway station, and a nice supermarket.  The room was a little small with no desk, but if you are out most of the time and only sleep, eat, and shower there it won't be an issue.  The kitchen was a nice size with plenty of dishes, pots & pans, glasses, etc."
442837,13994644,2014-06-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Nice, clean, modern place. Jo's communication was great. Her mum was there to check me in and was kind and helpful. I met Jo later in my stay and she was kind as well. It was an easy 10 minute subway ride to/from central station and easy to get to other areas of Stockholm as well. Area is quiet and there is shopping available within the complex if you need food and such. All around a good comfortable stay."
757320,35014796,2015-06-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Barb was a very welcoming and kind host who made us feel right at home. The location is perfect, only a 3 mins walk from the nearest tube station and a short walk to SoFo."
985944,5783139,2013-07-16T00:00:00.000Z,"This was my first airbnb stay, and I can only dream that subsequent bookings will be this good!

Anna accommodated me and my friends perfectly. She is great at communication, and always accessible via SMS or email. The apartment was clean, and all necessities were catered for.  She even had a little welcome package for us, with Swedish treats like Herring!

The apartment is spectacular and the photo's uploaded do it no justice. It is a close walk from the centre of stockholm, a few doors down from the subway, and located in a trendy area, full of vintage stores, bistro's and cafe's.

Would absolutely recommend and use again. Perfect host, perfect apartment."
1158791,94465029,2016-08-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Wir verbrachten im August eine Woche in Alex Wohnung. Der gesamte Organisationsablauf und der Kontakt mit Alex waren sehr gut. Die Wohnung ist sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet, wir fühlten uns sofort sehr wohl. In der näheren Umgebung gibt es Supermärkte, Bäckereien, Restaurants, Haltestellen für Bus und U-Bahn und City Bike Fahrradstationen. Insgesamt können wir Alex und seine Wohnung weiter empfehlen."

1212891,240236186,2018-03-04T00:00:00.000Z,"It was my second time staying at Maud's home and it was wonderful as expected. Maud is a brilliant host, I said it before and I say it this time, she is the perfect host! Kind, cheerful, helpful and friendly. And her house is so cosy! 

The Purple Room is beautiful, clean and comfortable. I slept incredibly well.

The house's location is perfect as it is close to the metro/subway. You can get to the city centre in a matter of minutes. It's a fantastic location to get around Stockholm and visit everything. Also, there's a big supermarket and a caffeteria next to the house, 2-minute walk.

I'm definitely coming back again to meet Maud and her lovely cat next time. I'm so grateful!"
274876,5456675,2013-07-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Emma's place is wonderful and convenient by bus to the city center.  Her father met us to let us into the apartment and he was a wealth of information about Stockholm, both its history as well as recommendations what to do during our stay.  Also the elevator was wondering being that I was 7.5 months pregnant at the time.  The building is quite and with a great courtyard."

The location is close to public transport and to supermarkets and restaurants. Our room had a nice balcony towards the morning warm sun. The apartment is well equipped. The only downside is that three rooms are sharing one bathroom, almost 6-8 people."

She was kind enough to sit down with me when I arrived and walked me through ways to get around the city and main spits to check out. Her place was in a perfect location and was comfortable and clean. I think you'll appreciate Lidi's cheery disposition and her great apartment, if you stay with her. Many thanks to Lidia for making my stay in Stockholm a memorable one. :)"
1212891,247116247,2018-03-27T00:00:00.000Z,Maud ist super freundlich. Man ist nur 10 Minuten vom Zentrum entfernt. Auch vor Ort kann man sehr gut essen gehen.

The flat was very nice, super clean, well equipped and does look even better than the photos. Very arranging (we were arriving very late at night), Madeleine has been a perfect host. Everything was clearly explained too.

The area is lovely. A very short walk to the closest tube station. Few shops and restaurants in the street. A nice 20 minutes walk to the Gamla Stan island along the river.

We would definitely recommend the flat to anyone going to Stockholm for a few days!"

The appartment is absolute nice, corresponds 100% to the photos shown at airbnb and we found it perfectly clean when arriving. The apartment was quiet and comfortable with ample supplies of coffee for the machine, a good fridge and the necessaries for basic cooking. The location is perfect with nice restaurants nearby and in walking distance to Stockholm center etc. The scenery around the apartment is very nice also and walking  is very enjoyable.

1212891,181541967,2017-08-13T00:00:00.000Z,"L'appartamento era molto pulito ed organizzato. Nonostante ci fosse un altro coinquilino ognuno aveva i suoi spazi sia in cucina che in bagno. La posizione è buona, a circa 10 minuti con i mezzi dal centro. Maud è stata fin da subito molto gentile e disponibile. La cucina è molto ben attrezzata (forno, microonde, bollitore, macchina per il caffè, tostapane). Ci siamo sentiti come a casa nostra e se dovessimo tornare a Stoccolma torneremmo sicuramente qui."

Her home is very welcoming and she was available by phone when i needed a taxi.
608672,150940933,2017-05-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Karl's place was very well located a few blocks off the main pedestrian-only shopping street. It allowed easy access to the main city and old town, while being tucked away from any noise. 

The apartment was very clean and the bed is very comfortable. Karl was very helpful in explaining the metro and how to get around. We appreciate him being flexible with our checkout time, though it is important to note that there was no other guests arriving on our checkout day. Nonetheless, it was very nice of him to allow us a few extra hours before our flight. 

The shower, as Karl explained, is a little unconventional - and historic building codes prevent him from updating it - but it is hot and works well. All in all it was very enjoyable and we would return again next time we visit Stockholm."

514210,44179519,2015-08-24T00:00:00.000Z,"These 3 weeks, that me and my boyfriend, passed in Margareta's airbnb were wonderful. As hosts Margareta and her children are really warm and helpful. 

We arrived late from the airport and Margareta kindly drove us from Stockholm center to her accommodation. It roughly took 15 minutes by car but you are already in place full of nature, peaceful and close-by a swimmable lake. By the public transportation which is highly efficient (bus + subway), the same track takes 30min maximum.

Margareta's accommodation itself is a pretty big apartment, clean and tidy. You are hosted in a really conformtable room, have a private bathroom and access to the balcony where you can enjoy a peaceful breakfast surrounded by flowers. The apartment is located 2min by walk from a supermarket and the bus station. It is also well placed for outside activities lovers. It is the best Airbnb we experienced so far.

Even more than the accommodation, we highly appreciated our hosts. Margereta is a clever woman, joyful and interesting.  She helped us to carry our apartment research and discover Sweden and Swedish. We also had fun with anthon & Julia, her two smart and well-educated children. They make our staying even more appreciable!

We will definitely recommend to our family and friends!"

It happens that some trend do emerge and focus on a given sort of interest ( for exemple the modern scandinavian literature ) and each year we organise a trip renting an apartment related to the part of the world we have dealing with. Before Sweden, we travelled to St Petersburg, Vienna, etc."

1212891,302753766,2018-08-06T00:00:00.000Z,Me encanto quedarme en la casa de mau! Ella me vino a buscar a la estación y fue muy atenta conmigo y mi amiga! Recomiendo mucho quedarse ahí y sacar la tarjeta de transporte ilimitado porque estas a pocas estaciones del centro pero no para ir caminando! Hay un supermercado con precios mucho más baratos que en el centro cerca de su casa!! MAXI SUPERMERKAT mucho mejor precio a que 7-Eleven
299154,56327537,2015-12-12T00:00:00.000Z,Daniel is reachable both by texts and website making it easier for us to talk to him. He is super friendly and the house was so great we wish we can stay longer. The location was perfect and easy to reach by public transport. We love it there !!
1271843,223423384,2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment is very nice and comfortable. It is in a perfect location: a few steps from the metro and in the trendiest district of Stockholm. Andrè was a perfect host, even if at a distance (in those days he was out of town): he left us all the useful information about the apartment and to move to Stockholm, and made us welcome by his friend Michael, very nice and friendly person, which suggested us different things to do and accompanied for the city. I advise everyone to spend a few days in Stockholm, a unique city, and to stay in a cozy apartment with very helpful people."

242188,449708515,2019-05-07T00:00:00.000Z,Li's place is in a great location for using the trains and buses to explore Stockholm.  Li is available for advice about what to visit and how to get there.  Her place has cafes and supermarkets nearby.  It is a safe neighbourhood.  The set up of her place allows you to be quite independent.  I really enjoyed staying there.
164448,3010404,2012-12-02T00:00:00.000Z,"I stayed at Lidia's place for 3 nights. The stay was comfortable and pleasant. Lidia is very caring and helpful. She advised the must see places of Stockholm, helped with the routes and public transport also. The house is pretty much in the center of Stockholm and near a station so commuting is immensely convenient."

862528,24379975,2014-12-27T00:00:00.000Z,"We enjoyed our stay for Christmas at arne’s place; tidy and comfortable house with chritsmas decorations in the garden, quiet neighborhood, not far from a supermaket, subway station and 15 minutes to Södermalm, Stockholm by car. The house is fine for a family and Arne fixed a bed in the small room designed for a small children for one of our teens.
We didn’t meet Arne, but it was very easy to communicate with him if needed.
We go quite often to Stockholm and in Sweden and we willingly keep the spot for a next trip (winter is a nice season to visit the city but we couldn’t appreciate the terraces to eat, sunbathing and rest!)"
299154,38384101,2015-07-15T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a great stay at Daniels. Only 30m from the main strip on sodermalm and an easy 10 minute walk to Gamlastan. The apartment has a balcony which was great for having a picnic and people watching on Gotgarten. Daniel was really helpful and made some phone calls for us when we didn't have a phone card. Thanks Daniel, a lovely stay!"

Unfortunately my plane had a 3 hours delay so I didn't meet Dany in personal, but he welcomed the other members of my family very warmly - they were totally excited about his kindness and his helpful tipps. The house was perfect - we felt very comfortable and had some really wonderful days there. Also Dany was not angry at all, although I texted and called him at 10 p.m. the day before we left Stockholm. I want to thank Dany and his wife Maria and can totally recommend the house, there was plenty of space for the 5 of us and I would love to come back someday."

We met her boyfriend Victor who introduce us the house, also very nice and smiley boy. The house was small but enough for two persons, we didn't spend a lot of time there because Stockholm is very big to see. It was very nice the detail of the tea and coffee. We really feel like we were in home there. thank you!"
581243,87371304,2016-07-19T00:00:00.000Z,Svarade snabbt på meddelanden och var väldigt trevlig och välkomnande:) Jag trivdes superbra & rekommenderar starkt!

526170,47793068,2015-09-21T00:00:00.000Z,"I would not hesitate to hire the apartement again. Comfortable and cozy. Everything is there, what you need. WiFi works perfect. The kitchen is well equipped. The location to the city is ideal. The metro is around the corner and it takes only a few stops to get to the city. We did everything on foot, that is no problem as well. Supermarket and restaurants are near by. From Airport it will take about 35 minutes to the apartement by taxi. Magnus is a very good host, friendly and responds to any questions (mail / SMS) very quickly.  I recommend the apartment definitely!"

The bed is SO comfortable which is a major plus after spending my days walking around Stockholm. It's not very close to the city centre by foot but the metro stop is right under the building and it'll get you to the centre in only 4 minutes. I highly recommend this host. 
Thanks again for everything."
1244657,409298120,2019-02-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Nic And Usha home is the perfect place to explore the city from. The single room is large, warm and clean. Nic and Ush were very helpful with directions and transport advise. The apartment is in a great location. I really enjoyed my stay."
242188,208406880,2017-11-01T00:00:00.000Z,Really responsive and helpful host. Room had a great view and the place was quiet. The location was so convenient that I walked most days to the rest of the city.
1149820,14348585,2014-06-17T00:00:00.000Z,"We booked this apartment for 3 nights. We met Klara in the city for the keys and everything was fine with checkin/out. Also, Klara provided us with 2 cards for the bike sharing in Stockholm, which was very unexpected but really helpful!
The apartment is as expected. However, we found that there are very few plugs all over the room, so if you depend on them for your laptop phone etc. take a multiplier with you. Also, please note that the bathroom does not have any separation for the shower. Unfortunately, also the bed/mattress wasn't too comfortable for 2 as there are coil springs in the mattress and the mattress kind of \"bent through\" too much; the surface didn't stay even/flat. I can imagine that for \"heavy\" people it might be uncomfortable as well.
We didnt hear anything from neighbours, except for some music in the evenings. other than that it was pretty calm.
The neighbourhood was comfortable. There is a nice restaurant just on the other side of the street a bit uphill that is also doing outdoor concerts and parties in the summer. The place is not far from a Metro station."
581243,255062543,2018-04-19T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin's Airbnb is an incredible place to stay for solo travelers in Central Stockholm. Located right next to an indoor shopping mall and train station. The room and apartment are very clean and feel warm and welcoming.

The real treasure of this apartment is Edwin himself. He is a genuinely nice person who helped me out with a late check-in from the airport, something most other hosts would not have assisted with. He also gave great tips about the city, and has a wealth of experiences to guide travelers. Would highly recommend to any single travelers looking to stay in the heart of Stockholm"
975317,154991139,2017-05-27T00:00:00.000Z,"The location is great. Very convenient to use the metro and be near parks. They had a well-written list of recommendations, which was super helpful. The apartment is bright and spacious. If you are not used to nordic countries (or the north) in the summer time be sure to bring a face mask."
1212891,15752839,2014-07-15T00:00:00.000Z,The place was clean. The kitchen had everything we needed. The location was great. Maud was very friendly and helpful. Her cats were adorable :)
739726,5598369,2013-07-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Sanna's place is a charming, comfortable and quiet apartment, very well located in a cool and convenient neighbourhood full of boutiques and cafes, close to transport and even walkable to the city. The apartment had everything we wanted for our stay: a well-equipped kitchen, convivial dining area, spacious loungey living room, super-clean bathroom, and romantic bedroom alcove with decadent, velvety and - most importantly - light-blocking drapes(allowing us the best sleep we had in our Scandinavian summer trip). Tastefully and personally decorated, but not at all cluttered, so one feels right at home. Our host Sanna was a great communicator: prompt and efficient, and that, coupled with easy car access for loading, unloading and night parking, made booking, check-in and check-out smooth as silk. We strongly recommend Sanna's place and would be delighted to stay again."
302496,5179823,2013-06-17T00:00:00.000Z,We've stayed at the apartment for a week. We loved it very much. It's a big full of light apartment furnished with great taste. It's good located in the center and the same time  quiet. Owners were very nice and helpful.

1212891,33085173,2015-05-25T00:00:00.000Z,"This place is amazing! Don't even hesitate to book it, it's absolutely great. First of all, Maud is super welcoming, you will feel completely at home during your stay. Then the location is great - it took us around 20 min, I think, to get to T-Centralen and it is in a very nice neighbourhood. We walked home from Gamla Stan once and you have a nice park pretty much the whole way. 
The room is exactly as described, we used kitchen a lot (you get your own place in the fridge and on the shelves and can use pans and such) and there are even teas and cookies left for you, which is always super nice. 
Oh, and there is a big grocery store right nearby with lots of choices and decent prices. And her cats are awesome."
954832,471316024,2019-06-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Mikael is amazing. He is very friendly and welcoming. If you are interested, he can provide you with many local tips and is available for your questions anytime. Communication with him is extremely smooth.

His place is great: Conveniently located near to subway and in proximity to all interesting places in Stockholm. On top of this, the apartment is very cozy and super clean. 

I highly recommend stay in Mikael's apartment!"

259025,2059827,2012-08-21T00:00:00.000Z,"The house was really clean more than our expectation and also Ali is friendly and supportive to help guests to visit city. Due to his experience for managing guests he is professional in hospitality and providing peaceful environment for guests. 

As an overview I would say that we were really satisfy to stay his house and it was better than hotel in comparison to price and services. It is recommended for young travelers."
164448,98382434,2016-08-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia was a fantastic host and very knowledgeable about Stockholm. She was almost always around on the first level of the apartment and always willing to help. We would recommend her to anyone!

The rooms are on the second level in the apartment, among a few others rooms with a shared living space and bathroom. Everything was clean and comfortable.

Easy access to trains and buses from the apartment. Sodermalm is an interesting area and relatively close to Gamla Stan, within a mile, and most other attractions."
145320,278477794,2018-06-18T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a really lovely stay at Kim's place and made the most of being in trendy Södermalm! Really lovely places to eat or sip a coffee and cool secondhand shops. I slept really well which is a good sign I guess. It felt like a home and it is a peaceful place. Would recommend to stay and I would come back any time. 
If you are in Sweden for the first time, the shower, stove and windows do work differently. My tip is to check those things on arrival and you are all set. Communication with Kim went well, organizing check in and check out was easy too."

343925,6529259,2013-08-16T00:00:00.000Z,"We spent six night & days in Annika's flat. The apartment is very clean, comfortable and well reflected by the pictures and its description. The living room is quite spacious, while the kitchen and the bathroom serve their purpose rather well although they are not very large. In the whole the apartment was larger than we expected, very well equipped and we were definitely very pleased during all our stay.
In addition the flat is located in a pretty quite area just five minutes from the Fridhemsplan T-bana (the nearest subway), which on its turn is just 2 or 5 stops from T-centralen (depending on the line you choose) or, if you prefer, just 20-30 minutes by walk from it. We did not explore very much the surrounding area, but if you plan to dine at home as we did, you can buy food in a well stocked Coop supermarket right next to the T-bana (which closes at 9 pm if we well remember).
Lastly, Annika was a delicious host: she provided us with plenty of information, she waited for us at the exit of the subway (even if we arrived quite late in the evening), she provided us with a hair dryer and she allowed us to leave our luggage at home until noon on our last day. She also messaged us a couple of times during the week in order to know if everything was ok."

I had my first experience with airbnb and it was much better than I thought and I stay for most probably 4 weeks. Alex's apartment is clean and cozy, near to the subway and the forest (great area with a small lake an beautiful trails for a run or a walk).
As host, alex made his best to feel like home and also give you tips what you can or must see in this beautiful city. He also take the time and will explain you how it works with other things in sweden, how the life goes on in sweden, how you get from A to B and witch is the easiest way to find the appartement or other things."

274876,16197083,2014-07-23T00:00:00.000Z,Emma's place was the perfect base for a girls weekend in Stockholm. The apartment was exactly the way it looks in the pictures and was very homey and welcoming. The location is central enough that we could walk almost everywhere but the neighbourhood was also quiet enough that we could relax at home in peace. I will definitely be recomending it to others!

 The room looked like exactly the way it looks like on the pictures!  Everything was very tidy, clean, very nice atmosphere and quiet. No motorbike noises by night from the street  ( was very important to me.. ) One has really  everything for relaxing there. The area the apartment is located in is very close to the city center and has  very good access to the public transport. 
Lidia is an amazing host, she was very helpful and gave me a very detailed explanation of the way to her apartment,so I could get there very easily.
I must mention I still got free coffee,tee ect. even though I did not order breakfest !
I would very much recommend her place for staying in Stockholm if you're on holidays or even for your business trip on a budget."

Sauber und sehr gute Lage neben einem Supermarkt und neben einer Bushaltestelle. Der Bus fuhr alle paar Minuten ins Zentrum. Kann ich nur weiterempfehlen.

1054406,80258285,2016-06-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Thomas and Madeleine are absolutely fantastic hosts! They were very responsive and provided us with all the information we needed to enjoy our stay in Stockholm. The apartment is really nice (looks better in person than the pictures), spacious, and was very comfortable for our group of 6 adults. We drove up to their place and there is parking right outside the apartment. It is also very close to a beautiful lake with walking/bike trails. We were traveling with our parents and Thomas and Madeleine were so kind as to get us a SL access card for our trip to the city. The bus stop is a 5 minute walk to the train station, which is a short ride away from the city center. They periodically kept checking in to ensure that our stay in Stockholm was both enjoyable and very comfortable. I would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Stockholm. Thanks Thomas, Madeleine!"

We were a family of 6 and there was enough space for us. It provided a great base for visiting Stockholm and was so easy to cook for all of us and spend time just relaxing - thank you so much Marie."
