Annika was such a sweet host. She was very flexible with our check-in and check-out time. She welcomed us with nice breads and fresh fruit. Very recommended all in all."
553914,240241416,2018-03-04T00:00:00.000Z,"This apartment was a great way for me to jump into exploring Stockholm. The space itself is very comfortable and cozy and is well decorated. It's not particularly large, but it was more than enough space for myself and a friend to use as a place to rest while running around the city. Location-wise, the apartment is in a fairly quiet neighborhood that is extremely walkable to many other sections of the city. We never used public transit while we were there, aside from getting too and from the airport, and we found the location to be a great distance to a lot of interesting things, like the city center."
757320,78569544,2016-06-07T00:00:00.000Z,"When we stayed at Barb's we felt at home. Barb was a wonderwul host, we had nice conversations with her and she always was ready to help. The room is very comfortable and central to all places we liked to see."
1182616,468328170,2019-06-12T00:00:00.000Z,"房屋位置挺不错,距离市政厅步行只需十来分钟,距离地铁站只需两分钟,公交车站也很近｡
Peter挺好,预先会把如何到达住处,如何拿钥匙之类细节问题提前告知,有问题询问他,他也快速响应｡
住宿地有电梯,方便行李拿取,套房内有三个房间,我住的还带有一个小阳台,只是房间不太隔音,住的其他客人发出的声音或多或少会影响到我｡
但总体来说是不错的地方,值得向大家推荐~"
259722,1221733,2012-05-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Half of the room's walls are glass windows, both looking outside of the building and in the living room. These glass walls are covered with some tents, that's the privacy level the room enables. 
The real problem is actually having good sleep, as sun rises very early in the morning. Also I have been awaken by the  host, coming in at late night or couldn't fall asleep if somebody was watching tv or talking or cooking in the living room: the glass walls won't provide isolation either from light and sound. In one month I seldom awaken later than 6 am: plane mask is a must eventually bring earplugs.
The room is packed with kids stuff and the guest's cupboard is in the living room, in the room there is a narrow table and a kid's stool. 
I don't recommend this, especially if you plan to stay more than few days or if you are coming here to work."
533880,13647219,2014-06-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Jarl is a kind, considerate and professional host who gives 100% to his clients and only asks in return that you respect his property and possessions.  
I used the sauna, found the laundry room to be an excellent asset also and everyone I encountered was helpful and language issues for English speakers were minimal.  Jarl provided comprehensive transport, food and building access advice as well as a perfect internet access.
I wish more AirBNB suppliers offered the same level of diligence.
The Stockholm Marathon was epic and I hope to visit Jarl again in the future but for longer.
Thanks Jarl you were a credit to Stockholm and the AirBNB community.

Take care

Howard"

Alex was absolutely perfect in every way, very arranging, nice, perfect host I almost felt as good at at home, he is open minded and curious, you feel he is just a very nice person who wants to exchange ! He gave us all the details needed (also the address of this blues bar that I loved!), is an excellent cook and just wanted us to have a good stay, what we did! Don't change nothing Alex, and hopefully see you around !!"
274876,9540663,2014-01-02T00:00:00.000Z,I was traveling with some friends for New Years and stayed at Emma's apartment. We had a fantastic time. Emma is a great host and her apartment was beautiful and in a great neighborhood.
1212891,132298546,2017-02-17T00:00:00.000Z,Très agréable passage chez Maud pour découvrir la ville de Stockholm. Maud fait preuve de beaucoup de gentillesse envers ses invités et facilite grandement notre passage en se rendant disponible. Encore merci pour les petits gâteaux ;-)
259722,2454577,2012-09-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Marcelo is very friendly and hospitable. He even allowed me to have an ethernet cable running through his living room so i could have internet access. The park right behind the room is just amazing. You can take walk trails through the woods and pick up berries. 
The room is relatively small but it was just what i needed for that small period of time. Thanks Marcelo!"
871262,6309623,2013-08-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Lotta's place was just a perfect choice to live in, and Lotta in herself is a very cheerful lady. The grocery stores and restaurants were just a couple of minutes walk away and so are the tunnel bana and bus stations. The room is  nice and cozy equipped with all the necessary things. A very pleasent experience to stay with her."
299154,41899438,2015-08-09T00:00:00.000Z,"As our first visit to Stockholm, we chose this apartment because of its great location. There are shops and restaurants right outside the door, and the subway a minute away. Daniel was flexible with our arrival time since we took a later train from Oslo. I know we will try to stay here again next time we are in Stockholm!"

Close to the Metro and the apartment is placed on top of a smaller mall, so everything you need is close. It was nice and quiet. Edwin was a good host, shower me where everything was and told me where i should go to by food and such! 
I can warmly reccomend him!"

916806,5841563,2013-07-19T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a great stay at Mansour and Julia's  cosy apartment in Stockholm. They were incredibly generous  and kind hosts who were helpful in so many ways regarding anything that we needed in the apartment and by giving us tips and information about sightseeing in and around Stockholm.The apartment was clean, spacious and new with a modern well equipped kitchen, eating bench with four stools and a comfortable living space separate to the sleeping area. It is in a rustic area on the edge of a national park so at night we got glimpses of local wildlife such as hares and deer. It is fully self contained so we has our own sunny deck to eat outdoors and enjoy the sunshine and views. It is easy to get to public transport with a bus that runs to the station or a pleasant walk thru the park and there is plenty of parking if you have a car.    I would highly recommend their accommodation and we would stay there again. Thank you for making our holiday in Stockholm such a happy experience."

I will certainly return on my next trip to Stockholm."

723539,278494200,2018-06-18T00:00:00.000Z,Beautiful apartment in a great location. Very central but on a quiet street in a safe area. Mathias was very responsive and wonderful to work with. Would definitely recommend!
1262188,289423849,2018-07-12T00:00:00.000Z,Karin's place is a lovely 2-bedroom flat in a very convenient location in Sodermalm. She was very helpful and quick to reply to messages. The apartment was well-supplied and the wifi worked well without any problems. I'd recommend the place to anyone travelling to Stockholm.
822497,490752209,2019-07-19T00:00:00.000Z,Take the train. It is not difficult to find the apartment.  Do not take a taxi.  It is very expensive.

1234960,44296334,2015-08-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Jacob is a great host and a great guy. He was helpful and hospitable in every possible way and did everything to make our stay as enjoyable as possible - including caring for food and drinks as well as giving great suggestions where to spend time and what to do in Stockholm. We felt very welcome and truly had the impression that Jacos is genuinely interested in the people he hosts. Short: Jacob is a host extraordinare ;-)  
The house is very convienently located. Public transportation is a mere 5 minutes walk away, getting to the buzzing areas of Stockholm, such as Södermalm only takes a couple of minutes. Same applies to a large convenience store, bakery, restaurants etc.
Despite the central location, the environment is very quiet, We even had deer in the garden at multiple occasions (much to the enjoyment of our kids).
The house and its equipment is very much as described and shown in the pictures. We had a great, relaxed stay at Jacob's house!"
871262,165268344,2017-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,The location of Lotta's place is just perfect. You can reach everything by walking - I never had to buy a tram/bus ticket. The room and the rest of the apartment were very clean. Lotta is a very nice host. She gave me a lot of interesting information about the city in the beginning and was always avaible when I had questions. I can really recommend this room.
916806,227823840,2018-01-16T00:00:00.000Z,We had a nice time in Julias place. The apartment is confortable and clean. Julia was really nice and helped us with everyrhing we needed.

347192,29976465,2015-04-15T00:00:00.000Z,"We took the express train from the airport and then the subway from the railway station. It was just a short walk from the subway to the apartment. We were met, welcomed and admitted to the apartment and were provided with a good explanation of the facilities. Lovely comfortable apartment which gave us a great base to explore Stockholm. Our host even provided wine which was most welcome!"
299154,518220503,2019-08-26T00:00:00.000Z,"Daniel's place is the perfect location to visit Stockholm, it is in a very cool area, yet the street where the apartment is on is very nice and quite. The main sites are within walking distance or easily approachable with public transport. 
The apartment is a studio, and it could be perfect for a couple or a family with 2 small children, it might be a bit tight for 4 adults but definitely manageable. The inside of the entrance door is a large blackboard so be careful not to smudge it and get a bit of chalk on your clothes. 
Daniel's a great host, very helpful and always quick to respond. We had a great time there."
581243,435764578,2019-04-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Edwin was an amazing host, since the start of the booking, he really kind and helpful if you want some help with directions. We enjoyed our time there."

Paul left very detailed instructions on everything and was very helpful and quick to respond to questions.  The apartment is literally just steps away from a city bus line (which is real easy to use).  Our family of three enjoyed our stay in this very roomy apartment and highly recommend it to others.  Stockholm is a must-see city!"

259025,1069545,2012-04-01T00:00:00.000Z,"We are two girls from the UK. We enjoyed our stay and Ali is very nice and helpful. At first its a bit hard to find the house as there are not enough roadsigns in most part of Stockholm, and they are mostly swedish. Nevertheless, we found the house and it is very pretty and well organised. We love the kitchen especially!!! Ali is very kind to us and to save budgets, we are allowed to cook in his kitchen. everything is perfect! We will surely recommend others to stay at Ali's!!!!"
1041103,12123697,2014-04-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Wonderful place, wonderful clean and peaceful neighbourhood. We really loved our stay, the apartment is beautiful and Karoline kindly allowed us to borrow her son's toys and buggy, which was great. The only minor suggestions I would have would be to leave a hairdryer for guests, if possible, and we also found it hard to sleep at night as the curtains are so light! But overall we had a wonderful stay and would definitely come back. Thank you."
985944,485685093,2019-07-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Thanks to Anna, the trip to Stockholm was very happy. 
Anna and her family's apartment was much wider and more beautiful than the picture. Everything Anna had prepared for us was friendly and perfect.
Communication was also fast and accurate. 
Best hosting! Best apartment! Best location. 
If we go to Stockholm again, we want to stay in Anna's beautiful apartment again.

688947,6238122,2013-08-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Alexandre was a great host, he is very kind and made us feel at home. The subway is close from his house and it is very easy to get to central Strockholm. Close from his house there is also a supermarket and several cheap restaurants.

One night he some of his friends came to play music, he invited us to eat barbecue with them and we spent a great evening and they left early so that we could sleep. His son Bruno was also at home, he was very nice and funny, and didn't disturb us at all.

We had a wonderful time and highly recommand Alexandre to anyone who wants to spend a great time in Stockholm !"
536283,74567139,2016-05-15T00:00:00.000Z,"2 friends and I stayed at the apartment during Eurovision. We were concerned that it might be too small all of us in one room as we are girls. But it was great. Even with 3 beds (very comfortable all of them) all our suitcases and stuff! Very Spacious
It was in a great area with bars, restaurants and supermarkets close. Loads to do in walking distance with great transport links. 
Paolo was great, we were arriving late and he arranged for someone to be waiting for us with the keys, even though the flight was delayed as well. 
I would definitely stay again when I return to Stockholm
Thanks for a great stay and letting us use the apartment"
1205051,25353648,2015-01-13T00:00:00.000Z,"We just came back from Viktor's apartment and cannot be more pleased!!!It is superbly located in a trendy neighborhood and close to all services and transport. The apartment itself is a real gem: take a close look to the gorgeous living room: in real, it is even more impressive! No doubt  to have here: Viktor got quite a eye and taste when it's time to create an ambiance and for home decoration. And very important, it was super clean! Don't worry about communication: super fast answer, often within minutes.

And Stockholm: what a city to enjoy and discover. We will certainly come back sooner then later and i'll contact Viktor for his place for sure

Many thanks"

Room is comfortable, cozy, and clean. 
I think location of this room is perfect for traveler.
Although he was not in his house during my staying period, but his feedback was immediate, accurate, and perfect.
Everything I need was in this house, so it was so comfortable.
Even I cancel my left reservation because my schedule changed, but he deeply understand my situation and keep kindness until I check out.
After I check out, he permit to left my bags in his house because he consider my situation.
There is no doubt to stay in his house.
If I have a chance to travel in Stockholm, I will stay his house again!!

We even could lend bikes and explore the city this way."
1272348,62751178,2016-02-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Magnus really went out of his way to help us celebrate valentines weekend in Stockholm. Check-in went effortless and communication was good at all times. Apartment is located in (in my opinion) the best part of town, literally 5 minutes from a subway station on a major line - 15 minutes from the central train station. It's more spacious than the pictures would suggest, apartment has everything anyone would ever need and the bed is easily big enough for two people.

Would definitely recommend Magnus' apartment for anyone looking to stay in Stockholm"
1204621,97533703,2016-08-27T00:00:00.000Z,"I had a wonderful time staying at Nettan's place during my short visit to Stockholm. First of all, Nettan was very nice and supportive. My luggage arrival was delayed and she assisted my communication with the airport. Secondly, the flat itself is super clean and comfortable, and its location is 7 min away from the Gardet metro station. Also. The room feels bigger than how it looks in the pictures. Nettan let me use the kitchen freely and gave me a whole drawer and a shelf in the fridge. Thirdly, she was extremely helpful with tips and directions. I would definitely recommend you to take her place and would be very happy to visit there myself again!"

Viveka's home is lovely, very close to metro station and also to supermerkat if you want to eat something. The best thing of staying in Viveka's home is that is in the middle of the nature and it's a very quite zone for relaxing and take a coup of coffe. 
We will come backup for sure!!!! :)"
1170766,13045644,2014-05-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Annika was a great host! The place is exactly as shown in the pictures, which is a great top floor studio apartment with kitchen. The room has plenty of light, a nice patio, and a comfortable bed. It is located in a great part of Söder with many grocery stores, restaurants, and shops very close to the apartment. The Mariatorget station is just a short walk from the rental, providing quick access to Gamla Stan (2 stops) or the city (3+ stops). I can't recommend Annika's place enough in an area that has quite expensive hotels!"
299154,274809223,2018-06-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Great location near tons of restaurants and stores. Comfortable bed and place, although a lot of personal items in storage around the place (but hey it’s Airbnb). Loved the balcony. Daniel seemed super nice. Love the neighborhood and would definitely stay again."
1182616,19706147,2014-09-16T00:00:00.000Z,"It was easy to arrange the details with our host. He was very responsive and I felt all the time, that I am important for him. The apartment was perfect, located near to the city center. The public transport was excellent, everything was correct as that was described in the ads."
954832,436460172,2019-04-13T00:00:00.000Z,"A big thank you to Mikael and Anna-Karin. Great hosts- thank you for the great communication beforehand, meeting my friend and I outside the apartment to check in and for checking up on us throughout our stay. Had a lovely time visiting Stockholm."
700113,37782934,2015-07-10T00:00:00.000Z,"I had an excellent stay in Ilona's flat. It was clean, comfortable and quiet. It is perfectly located between the city centre in the south and the university in the north so I could do everything walking. No need for public transport. Also the connection from the airport via the Alranda Flygbus is good. The internet was indeed a bit weak, but Ilona said she had already ordered a new access point, so I am sure this will be sorted out in due course. Overall I had an excellent experience and would definitely stay again with Ilona!"
164448,6491512,2013-08-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia is a very friendly host, always willing to help and give advice. You can make tea or coffee for yourself when you want. She has several other rooms in her flat for rent. If that doesn't put you off, then she's a great host for you."
700113,268798382,2018-05-26T00:00:00.000Z,The place was very clean and the balcón has a beautiful view of a park. Greatly enjoyed my stay in Ilona's place.
259025,15161970,2014-07-03T00:00:00.000Z,Ali's apt. Is clean and comfortable. He went out of his way to meet us at t-bana station (a 5 min walk from his apt) when we arrived. We didn't really see him much because we were gone most of the time. It's about 15 min to the city center on the train.
1212891,115944855,2016-11-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Wir hatten eine wunderschöne Woche in Stockholm. Maud ist sehr zuvorkommend und gab sich Mühe, unseren Aufenthalt so schön wie möglich zu gestalten und uns mit Rat und Tat beiseite zu stehen. 
Die Wohnung war immer sehr sauber, auch am Zimmer kann man nichts beanstanden. Die Küche war sehr gut ausgestattet, und auch an Kräutern an Gewürzen, etc. war alles wichtige vorhanden und konnte mitbenutzt werden. 
Die Wohnung liegt einige Gehminuten von einer U-Bahnhaltestelle entfernt, mit der die ganze Stadt gut erreichbar ist."
302496,464211614,2019-06-05T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment is absolutely huge.  The entry, living dining and library rooms are warm and inviting and decorated with outstanding art.  The location could not be more convenient.

We found the master bed room a great place to sleep.  The second bedroom is in the back of the apartment off the kitchen, I am sure it was serving quarters but the bed was very comfortable.  We did not try or use the foldout bed which is located in the dining room.

Seta was very responsive.  She arranged the next door neighbor to let us in.  She responded to every request, usually within 30 minutes.

Our only negative is the distance from the bathroom to the master bedroom.  One had to walk the entire length of the apartment. If there were more than just one family staying in the apartment this might be problematic.

Overall we loved it."
624886,3104670,2012-12-17T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a fantastic weekend in Stockholm, and Oskar ad Lisa's apartment was perfect: beautiful, clean, spacious, close to public transport, and did I mention beautiful?!  It was warm and cosy, and our children really appreciated the boys' bedroom, especially with its bunk beds, books and puzzles.  Thank you, Oskar and family, for a lovely weekend.  We didn't want to come home!!"
974175,31290385,2015-05-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Sophie and Jesper welcomed us upon arrival in their amazing appartement. As a group of 4 girls, we all envied the decoration of her appartement. Everything was explained very well and we felt right at home. 
We can only praise this apparement to other citytrippers! 
For us it was a first experience with Airbnb and it was a very good one.
One disadvantage? we couldn't take enough home in our bags :) 
Sophie and Jesper, thank you again for this amazing long weekend and opening up your home. You made us feel very welcome."
581243,453215280,2019-05-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Un anfitrión estupendo, estancia agradable y todo impecable. Aunque no está en pleno centro, esta muy cerca y se evitan los tumultos de turistas. Un 10!

--------

A great host, very comfy stay and everything was spotless. Although it isn't exactly in downtown Stockholm, it's at walking distance of the main tourist sights and avoids the tourist crowds. A 10!"
581243,29778065,2015-04-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Me and my girlfriend stayed there for three nights, and we have found the house extremely clean.

Edwin is a nice guy, and he knows English pretty well.
The house is pretty close to metro station (1 min walking), you can take the train there and go to city center in less than 10 minutes.

You can use the kitchen utensils (as long as you wash them afterwards), and cook your own food.

On my next visit to Stockholm, hopefully i will stay in the same house."
920582,148715784,2017-05-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Great communication from Suzanna and Ollie, who have a lovely apartment, in all aspects. I would fully recommend anyone visiting Stockholm to stay at their place."
871262,42934427,2015-08-16T00:00:00.000Z,"I agree with those who say good things about Lotta and
her place, the location, the room, the bed etc.  However, I did not push the More+
link in the amenities part of Lotta’s Airbnb page online before I booked (my mistake)
and therefore I did not see that there is no kitchen access. I see this as a drawback when you are staying for ten days, as I did."
164448,316332466,2018-08-31T00:00:00.000Z,"Li is een hartstikke aardige vrouw die er alles aan doet om je verblijf bij haar zo prettig mogelijk te maken. Je mag haar altijd alles vragen en daar geeft ze ook graag antwoord op. Aan het begin van ons verblijf heeft ze ons allemaal tips gegeven over wat er te zien is in Stockholm en na het horen van onze voorkeuren wist ze nog wat meer specifieke tips te geven, waardoor ons verblijf in Stockholm zeker beter is geworden! In het verblijf zelf zijn de meubels wat oud, maar er hangt wel een hele gezellige sfeer. De badkamer is erg schoon en de douche is verrassend lekker. De bedden sliepen heerlijk en ook had Li er zelf al voor gezorgd dat er genoeg stopcontacten waren. Al met al een heerlijk verblijf hier gehad en we zouden het zeker aanraden!"
1244657,7698314,2013-09-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Very nice hosts, and the location is very convenient - right across from the Slussen station. The room was big, the bed was comfortable, and I was able to use the kitchen, which was great. Biggest thing I missed was somewhere to hang my clothes - not a small detail when traveling for business. But definitely recommended overall!"
854975,8261878,2013-10-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Sergej has been a great host! Right after our arrival, he already got in touch with us and provided us with really helpful information on how to get from the airport to the apartment. On our arrival, he showed us the basics of his apartment and also had a guest manual with some recommendations for exploring Stockholm. The communication with him has always been very friendly, uncomplicated & clear.

The apartment itself is located about 5 minutes walking distance from the Odenplan. It is fully furnished, has a nice balcony and everything you need for a Stockholm trip.

We enjoyed it a lot and will definitely come back again! Thank you for an unforgettable stay!"
565912,41931899,2015-08-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Lovely house located in a quite neighborhood in close enough proximity to central tourist destinations.  

Host was accommodating and provided a baby cot.  House works well for small children as there are plenty of toys, stairs and outdoor space to entertain them.

2 children's playgrounds in the neighborhood and extremely well equipped kitchen for those who love to cook.  

Very nice experience overall."
1170766,321732520,2018-09-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Annika was home to greet us when we arrived and showed us to her penthouse apartment that is clean, spacious, and quaint. The room is like a studio apartment on a separate level using a separate entrance. The location is wonderful - close to bus and metro stations, has many good eateries nearby, and is about 25 minutes (at a strolling pace) to the old town Gamla Stan.

Overall, it was great to have a comfortable place like Annika's to come back to after trekking all over the city during our 3-day trip!"
838442,123216728,2016-12-28T00:00:00.000Z,good location.
897584,3519829,2013-02-11T00:00:00.000Z,"We are a small family and this apartment was perfect for us! It was a very clean and cozy room. Viveka and her friend were so hart-full persons, so we was able to stay  in plenty. 
There is a bus stop in the front of the apartment which takes within 10 min from Linneholmen, and it was very convenience when we had much stuff or carried a baby car.
We hope to stay there again next time, too."
1212891,17679018,2014-08-16T00:00:00.000Z,"We were really well received by Maud, she is smiling and very helpful. The apartment, and the room, is nice and confortable. We loved the positive messages on the walls of the bathroom!"
1182616,36151771,2015-06-25T00:00:00.000Z,"We stayed with Peter for one night in Stockholm: he was very flexible with checkin/checkout so the whole experience was very seamless. The apartment is fully rented out by airbnb so we shared it with other two groups of people who were travelling as well, making it feel more hostel-like than staying with a host. That was more than okay for us as we knew our way around but maybe that is not the case for everyone. The apartment was nice and clean, with all the amenities we needed.

The location was okay - close to the metro stop so it is easy to get anywhere, it is on a busy street so a lot of places to eat/cafes however it definitely is not my favourite part of Stockholm. 

All in all, we enjoyed our stay, it was hassle-free and nice, exactly what we needed for one night."
242188,1304824,2012-05-19T00:00:00.000Z,Great location & easy to use public transportation. Very clean & quiet space to stay in. Lidia met me for arrival & explained everything on her map of Stockholm over a cup of tea. Thanks.

L appartement est propre et il y a tout ce qu'il faut. Tres bien placé pour utilisé les transports publics. Le quartier est calme et résidentiel un peu loin de sodermalm

Merci à Lina pour son accueil"

Son studio est confortable et le petit balcon est très appréciable par beau temps, sans oublier l'emplacement dans la ville vraiment idéal.
Je recommande !"

1170766,21292657,2014-10-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Het appartement is ruim, licht en schoon. Het ligt op de bovenste etage dus moet je wel wat trappen op om het te bereiken. De ligging is behoorlijk centraal in Stockholm zodat veel te voet kan worden bereikt. De metro is echter ook dichtbij. Een stalling voor huurfietsen is wat verder weg. De foto met netten voor werkzaamheden is niet actueel, er wordt niet gewerkt. Af en toe hoor je een vliegtuig, vooral in de ochtend."
1153177,365250916,2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Terry's apartment is a warm cosy spacious space with separate kitchen, dining and sitting rooms plus 3 good sized bedrooms, bathroom and separate w.c. It was spotlessly clean with lots of towels and shower gels etc for our use. Terry had even cooked some food and left it for us as well as some drinks."
1182616,61696138,2016-02-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Very nice room - the balcony is really nice, glassed in, in the winter.

Everything clean and well cared for and the bed was very comfortable...

The position is really good, close to the tube, hard to get lost finding it.

Overall, highly recommended"
299154,40665134,2015-08-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Great location, close to everything Sodermalm has to offer. Clean and artsy apartment. Daniel was very helpful and friendly.  He even helped us print our boarding passes for the long distance train. The apartment met all our needs."

647314,430895292,2019-03-31T00:00:00.000Z,Mallika's place is lovely and well situated (close to an underground stop for easy travelling!) and the room is beautiful and big. just to note the kitchen situation for when Mallika is staying in the house too - but this was well communicated.
357012,40935875,2015-08-03T00:00:00.000Z,"We really enjoyed our stay at Calles beautiful apartment. It's very comfortable, our 2-years-old daughter loved it. The area is also great we loved the Hornstull street market on Sundays with the food trucks. I can only recommend to stay there if you like to visit the city."
1212891,48513242,2015-09-27T00:00:00.000Z,This was my second time with Maud and was truly coming back to an old friend.  This time I noticed more all of the small details and plants that she maintains around the house - perfect and all blooming - does she have a greenhouse hidden somewhere>  Her other guests and friends/past guests stop by and a great time is to be had.  See you again in 20??.!
871262,55745925,2015-12-05T00:00:00.000Z,What a great place in a great neighborhood! 3 blocks to the subway. Quiet clean private room. Lotta is a great hostess. Well worth the price!
283446,19307617,2014-09-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Conveniently situated very close to a metro station and the room was exactly what I was looking for, very clean and fast wi-fi. Vida and Bala were were available to answer any questions and even woke up very early in the morning to offer breakfast before I left for the airport. Definitely recommended if you're looking to spend a few nights in Stockholm."
608672,182988032,2017-08-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Pros: 
-very centrally located within 20-30 mins walking distance of Gamla Stan and city hall. Drottninggatan, major shopping avenue is right around the corner. If you choose to use the metro, the closest station is a 5 minute walk. There's a grocery store, a corner store and lots of restaurants nearby 
- Karl was very responsive prior to and during my trip. 
- necessary amenities available and I was even able to do laundry free of charge 
- easy to navigate on public transportation from the airport 
-affordable 
-fast wifi 

Con
-the only minor con is the bathroom, but it really didn't bother me. The listing is very clear so you know what to expect up front. It isn't luxury but it gets the job done. I was hardly in my room anyway, as I was busy enjoying the wonderful city of Stockholm."
347192,22741451,2014-11-13T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment is beautiful, well decorated and really spacious.

1153177,45237211,2015-09-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Terry was a great host.  He greeted us with a home cooked meal of chicken soup,  fried cauliflower and crisps and left many more sweet treats.  He also did our washing for us.  His apartment is well located and a refreshing walk to the attractions, otherwise very close to the metro and lovely restaurants.  There is also a great market hall.  For a group of 5 persons it was also good to have a separate toilet and wash basin and really enjoyed waking up to hot,  filtered coffee.  The kitchen is well equipped  with everything you need and the place is very secure.  Made our stay  in Stockholm most pleasurable."
647314,196193501,2017-09-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Great quiet neighborhood with unique coffee shops! Very close to the metro so can get to main attractions with ease but walking is always better! The host has a couple cats, one that is very friendly in particular and we will miss him!"
164448,93140407,2016-08-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia was super sweet! She sat down and explained everything I needed to know about Stockholm when I arrived and was very accommodating during our stay. There were no blackout curtains in the room, but there were eye masks and a beautiful window overlooking a big (and busy) playground and courtyard. We loved staying in the less touristy Sodermalm, south of the main part of the city but still close to public transportation, shops, cafes and restaurants."
897584,6767929,2013-08-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Viveka's apartment is perfect for a stay in Stockholm: locked next to great transportation, big kitchen, cozy bed room that includes also a sofa for relaxing.
To top it all, you have a little terrace to sit and enjoy the nature around you.
And of course Viveka is the best host ever: helpful with transportation advice to and from the city; with tips on the city and food :)"
242188,106115644,2016-10-04T00:00:00.000Z,Lidia made me feel very welcome immediately I arrived.I felt as though I was living there rather than simply staying there.She went out of her way to describe the best places to visit and how to save money.I would stay here again.

776012,39341658,2015-07-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Airbnb was a new experience for us - and we were very plesantly surprised! we looked up Gamla Stan and liked the appartment.
Majken and Emil are perfect hosts making us feel welcome right away. They are warm, caring and have lots of humor. The apartment is wonderful, still bursting with history in the old part of Gamla Stan. It is the perfect place to start discovering beautiful Stockholm. We can recommend it!"
900043,175151871,2017-07-28T00:00:00.000Z,"The house was pleasant and corresponded to the uploaded pictures and description. It is in a very calm and tranquil neighborhood, next to a nice island where you can walk or swim, slightly out of the city center, but practically in front of the Hornstull subway station, from where you can reach the center in 20 minutes. A longer way of getting there is by walking for a good 40/50 min on the beautiful walk on the sea. In any case, the house is a good solution for a good price, but the fact that the kitchen is small and not fully equipped – perhaps just for us needy Italians! – and that it is, after all, a very simple accommodation make this house a more suited place for a short visit – 2/3 days – rather than for a long one – a week, like we did."

916806,320211900,2018-09-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Good  base to explore Stockholm. As Julia says in her listing, the apartment is an easy 30minutes commute from Stockholm city centre. The apartment is located in a very peaceful suburb with good local supermarkets and shops in the local shopping mall. The stunning view of the lake is a bonus, however, this is not visible from the apartment itself but from the balcony of the apartment above. Nice walks around the area. Communication with Julia was very good."

1250227,35213067,2015-06-16T00:00:00.000Z,Fin mysig lägenhet med närhet till allt vad Stockholm har att erbjuda. Väldigt lugn och bra gata med en mycket idyllisk miljö och Per som värd har varit väldigt hjälpsam under vistelsen.
1170766,346050820,2018-11-07T00:00:00.000Z,"Annika’s apartment is well located in a convenient and fun area of Stockholm. The space is bright and airy, with a lovely open feeling. Annika was a wonderfully relaxed host. We especially appreciated how flexible she was about check-in and check-out, where she worked around our very odd flight and work schedules. We heartily recommend this apartment to other travelers!"
164448,20625711,2014-10-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Great Host!! Great Location!!
I stayed with Lidia while working for a week in nearby Nacka. I had a very nice stay. Lidia is a lovely person, very kind and helpfull. When I arrived she helped me with my stuff and gave me a map showing me everything I needed to know about the area and how to get to work via public transport next day. 
Lidias home is very nice and clean just as you will see in the pictures. I liked the way she has a microwave, fridge and tea making facilities for guests which makes more comfortable for longer stays.
The apt is minutes walk to transport links only couple of stops to Central station. Sodra station is only 30 second walk and from there you can get a direct train to and from Arlanda.
Although I was working a lot is was good that lidia's place in Sodermalm is only 5 minute walk from  medborgarplatsen which is great for going out with loads of nice bars and restaurants. 
When I return to stockholm I will definately be staying with Lidia."
608672,85964074,2016-07-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Karl's apartment is located in the middle of Stockholms heart. Only one street away from the main shopping street and 10 minutes walking from the central station.
The communication with Karl was very good. He answered fast. After our arriving, he explained us every thing which we needed to know about the place. Furthermore, Karl gave us a map and a short introduction about where to find what in Stockholm.
The apartment is very simple and smaller than it looks on the pictures. The \"kitchen\" has a small fridge, a microwave, coffee machine and two hotplates - But no sink. The dishes must be made in the tiny sink in the bathroom. Another thing missing is a place to eat. There is a table, but it's more like a working desk and not ideal to eat.
The bathroom is also very small and there is no real shower in it. When showering the whole floor is under water since there is only a curtain.
The apartment offers wifi - the signal isn't very good though. And on our stay it didn't work properly.
All in all it's a good location for a weekend but it's quite expensive even it's good located. 

One week before our arrival, Karl sent us the directions to find the appartment and some more information. He also wrote that there were ongoing constructions on the house during our stay. We really appriciated his honesty, but didn't expected the noise at 7am."

Overall it was a very positive experience!"

During the time spent at the apartment we felt a little bit like trendy \"Stockholmers\" :) The location is unbeatable, it is really easy to walk either north or south from it and it is fantastic for evening walks in the old city. The views and light are also really special. 

Overall, I would strongly recommend Majken's lovely apartment and warm welcoming."
1041103,9874574,2014-01-16T00:00:00.000Z,"Me and my parents stayed in this spacious and cozy apartment for 5 nights. We really enjoyed it. There's everything you'd need. There are three bedrooms, each with a comfortable and large bed. There is a big living with two sofas, one of them is a sofa bed. There are also a lot of toys, so, if you have kids with you (we received the visit of our swedish grandchilds/nephews), they can  have some fun in playing with them. Furthermore, Karoline and her kind daughter Simone provide us everything we needed for the breakfast. About the area where the flat is located (Aspudden/Hägerstensvägen): it's very handy and convenient...you have the Tunnelbana (Stockholm's subway) very close to the apartment, only 3 minutes by foot and there are also some shops/cafe's/restaurants where you can do some grocery shopping or drink/eat something. All in all, I'd definitely recommend this apartment to other guests! :)"

He explained us all the rules in the apartment and he answered to alla my question about the city, transport, museums....He was very kind and offered his help also for the day after the check in.
The apartment is not so big, but it has all the things you need, and we were I, my husband and my daughter that is one year old.
Also the position is perfect:  minutes from the train station and the city center. There is also a bus stop and a metro station at 100 metres from the building and a lot of supermarkets and restaurants, so eating was not a problem!
I would like to thank Mikael very much!"

This tour took us to some great views that yes, we could technically go to ourselves, but we’d have to know about them, and even if we had, we wouldn’t have had the fantastic background information, setting the scene the whole way. Would be a great orientation tour for your first night in Paris."
700113,452849466,2019-05-14T00:00:00.000Z,Ilona was so warm and welcoming after I had travelled over 24 hours to get to Stockholm. She was always available to answer questions (and help me practice my Swedish!). The apartment is cosy but all you need and in a lovely neighbourhood. Endless cafes and all of Stockholm's major sights are accessible on foot. It is easy to get to from Arlanda airport as well (ten minute walk from Odenplan station and fifteen minute walk from Norra Stationsgatan bus stop via the Flygbussarna). I will definitely be trying to book here again on my next visit to Stockholm.

The apt is right in the middle of Sodermalm, and is in walking distance to Gamla Stan. Very close to T-stations as well. Definitely recommended for people who prefer a more local feeling compared to a touristy feeling when visiting a new place. Paolo was very responsive as well."
646635,33960101,2015-06-02T00:00:00.000Z,"Kristina is such a perfect host: she is very warm-hearted and welcome. She invited me to have dinner with her and her boyfriend. Kristina even gave me a bag of Swedish candy as a gift for me to enjoy during my train ride from Stockholm to Copenhagen.
The apartment is much much better than what I could expect: very beautiful decoration and layout, equipment in very good shape, beautiful balcony with peaceful view...
The neighborhood is also perfect: it is near to KTH, a prestigious university. Very quiet, near to a grand park (if you do a circle running, it will probably take you more than 2 hours) and beautiful waterfronts."
904739,43040615,2015-08-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Mean's place is situated in a great neighborhood near shops, bars and restaurants. It's just a short bicycle ride to the city center (Gamla Stan/ Radhuset, etc). The street is very quiet.
The apartment itself was really clean and comfortable, especially for one person (because of the small bed)...But like Menaf says, the couch is also very comfortable. 
Contact with Menaf was quite easy. Before I entered the building, I knew everything I had to know for my stay.
An early check in was no problem, which was excellent!
Stockholm is a very beautiful city and I hope to come back soon and be able to stay at Menaf's place again! I can recommend it."

La localización si que es ideal, ya que esta perfectamente bien conectado y en un momento caminando, en metro o bus estás en los monumentos más importantes de Estocolmo. A Peter solo lo vimos una vez , unos pocos minutos, pero se porto muy amable con nosotros. Nos hubiera encantado poder compartir con él. Encontramos a faltar el Desayuno, clave fundamental en este sistema (AirB (breakfast)&B) y sobre todo, pensamos que todo hubiera sido ideal y estupendo si el baño hubiera estado limpio. Queremos quedarnos con lo bueno, pero hace falta una buena limpieza del piso en general y el baño en lo particular."
608672,59909487,2016-01-17T00:00:00.000Z,"Karl welcomed me a little earlier than we agreed which was great as I was tired after a long day. He took the time to show me around the apartment and suggest a few places to eat. The space itself is clean, modern and fine for 1 person or a couple.  It is located on a quiet street right near the shopping district and is fairly close to many popular places; it is a 15-20 minute walk to the old town and 10 minutes walk from the airport shuttle. The only downside is the shower which is in a small bathroom with no screen or bath so water goes all over the floor. The water didn't drain properly, but when I left Karl said the drain was blocked & he had fixed it. If you like a long shower then this isn't the place for you. Karl looked after my luggage for me after I checked out which was very sweet. I would stay here again. Thanks."

338470,14294005,2014-06-16T00:00:00.000Z,Gustaf was a very friendly and helpful host. The place is cozy and has its own style and charm. Location is excellent to discover the best of Stockholm
1234960,73877288,2016-05-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Thank you Jacob for letting us stay at your lovely home. Right from the start we had great communication - Jacob is super-fast at responding to questions and provides clear information - and we already felt very welcome and that he was someone we could trust. The house is very homely - has everthing and more that you could want on holiday, a home from home, and we were very comfortable indeed. The open-plan living room/dining room/kitchen is a really nice large space and gets so much sun and warmth. The house is in a very quiet street just a 5 minute walk from the railway station (which is only 10 minutes or so from Stockhom Centralen and only 2 stops from the Ericsson Globe) - we saw a couple of deer in the garden one morning during our stay. There is a good supermarket just across the road from the train station if you want to pick up anything for cooking 'at home'. Jacob is a genuine chap and very generous, providing breakfast and provisions - he was also kind enough to find an extra bike for our stay, thanks for that Jacob. We would be very happy to stay at this accommodation if we visit Stockholm again."

The flat had everything we needed for a vacation/business trip. The shops are just around the corner too. We appreciate the little touches like the espresso machine, lots of information leaflets and fast broadband.

This place is definitely on the top of our list if we use AirBnB in Stockholm again."

His home is very nice and cosy. Its location makes it a perfect base for exploring Stockholm and it's a nice and warm place to come back to after a long day out in the chilly weather. 
The only minus is that there is no real access to the Internet at the appartement but that does not prevented us from enjoying our stay.

I would strongly recommend Mathias and his appartement if you're considering spending a few days in Stockholm!"

220851,196849778,2017-09-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Fredric's appartment is spacious, bright and quite.  It is conveniently located in the city with all the facilities needed in the walking distance (supermarket, restaurants, coffee shops, 7-11 convient shops, subway station and the airport bus).  The host is helpful, and there are all the basic conform in the appartment for a short stay in Stockholm."
368952,69224745,2016-04-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Madeleine und ihr Ehemann haben mich sehr herzlich willkommen geheißen. 
Ich habe für einen Monat das Gästehaus gebucht. Durch den Monatsrabatt kam ich auf 23€ die Nacht. Das Gästehaus ist eine sehr kleine Holzhütte, die mit dem Nötigsten ausgestattet war. Die Hütte steht in einem kleinen Wald, in dem man nichts, außer die Vögel zwitschern, hört. Im Häuschen war ein mittelgroßes Bett, ein Schreibtisch, zwei Möbelstücke für Kleidung, eine kleine Küchenzeile und eine Chemietoilette ohne Spülung. Fließend warmes Wasser gab es nicht, ich musste im Haupthaus Wasser in einen Behälter füllen und diesen wieder in die Hütte tragen. Geplant war, dass meine Freundin 3 Wochen später nach reist, sie hat die Reise letztendlich abgesagt, weil die eben genannten Dinge, nicht in der Anzeige hervorgegangen sind. In der Anzeige gab es nur Bilder vom Haupthaus, sodass wir ausgegangen sind, dass das unser Wohnbereich wird. Wir hatten dadurch auch in Kauf genommen, dass das Haus außerhalb des Stadtzentrums ist. Denn für ein paar Euro mehr kann man in einem Hostel fließendes, warmes Wasser, beziehen, hat eine Toilette, die spült und muss nicht alles zum Schluss reinigen. Wenn man das Gästehaus mietet, muss man sich bewusst sein, dass man die Toilette reinigen muss, sobald man sie benutzt. Das war ein Erlebnis, dass ich nicht noch einmal wiederholen möchte. 
 Das Gästehaus ist für jene gut geeignet, die auf jeglichen Luxus verzichten können und sich mit der Natur sehr verbunden fühlen. 

Das war meine erste und sehr lehrreiche Erfahrung mit Airbnb."
299154,71978287,2016-04-30T00:00:00.000Z,"The apartment was as expected, cozy and beautiful, while its central location counts definitely as a strong plus, too. The host is kind and helpful, although I did not face any problems with the house. It is ideal for one person or a couple and I would recommend to anyone visiting the city either for a short or a long time."
242188,2052424,2012-08-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Lidia is a very cool host. Her place is very well located and comfortable. Very nice to talk to her about her life experiences. I highly recommend having her breakfasts. She sets out quite a spread for only 50 Krowns. It is a great way to start the morning. Make sure you follow her instructions on taking the J to her apartment and you will be set finding her. The bed was really comfortable . Especially after sleeping on Russian ferrys. I plan on coming back to Stockholm next summer and will definitely be asking Lidia if she has a room for me."
581243,20091267,2014-09-23T00:00:00.000Z,"Эдвин очень гостеприимный. Встретил нас в 7 утра (!) и не пришлось ждать на улице. Всячески помогал по ходу нашего пребывания.
Хорошо говорит по-русски.
В квартире очень чисто и уютно (и тихо). Расположение суперское.
Остались очень довольны.
Спасибо!"

624886,92743758,2016-08-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Where do I begin? Oskar's apartment is everything you need for a perfect holiday and more! Sodermalm is the perfect neighborhood to stay when exploring Stockholm as it's well connected and packed with restaurants, shops, supermarkets and outdoor spaces perfect for young families like us. The house itself is better than the pictures show as some rooms have been redecorated to a wonderful taste, making it even more practical. Children's room packed with toys -our daughter always wanted to stay in!, and beautiful master bedroom, both very comfortable. Quiet street but close to amenities and public transport. Bus to/from Arlanda stops 2 streets away so it couldn't be better. I could go on for hours, so please do not hesitate and book this house when you next travel to Stockholm, it will make your holiday an unforgettable experience."
533880,5175929,2013-06-17T00:00:00.000Z,The room is a very quit place to stay. 5 minutes to the sub. Jarl is a friendly and uncomplicated host. Every thing was well organized. I could enter the flat despite Jarl´s absence. In my opinion a very recommendable adress.
301680,32924624,2015-05-23T00:00:00.000Z,Anitta made me feel most welcome to her charming house. I would highly recommend her cosy room.
1170766,509948058,2019-08-15T00:00:00.000Z,"We spent two weeks in this studio and were very satisfied. The house and the surrounding is quiet, but you have underground, shopping facilities and restaurants very near. The Monteliusvägen with its wonderful view towards Stockholm center is only about 50 m away. Annika is a very good host, she cares for her guests."
242188,115399561,2016-11-24T00:00:00.000Z,Has been a warm welcome and pleasant being at Lidia place. She is really kindly and friendly.I truly recommend be at her place.
274876,1825893,2012-07-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Very nice flat, and pleasant setting for holidays in Stockholm. We didn't see Emma but everything was prepared for us. The apartment is located in a neighborhood with a lot of restaurants, cafés, markets and shops. It's easy to take the bus to visit different place of the town. We recommend this flat."
1170766,215209021,2017-11-28T00:00:00.000Z,This spot was very convenient and close to the T. Great views are just a short walk away. Sodermalm has much to offer with Akkurat beer hall being close by. We stayed in November and the skylights weren't a problem. Maybe in summer they could be bright.
700113,498708085,2019-07-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Ilona was a wonderful host. She made us feel very welcome, and the communication went always smoothly. Her apartment was small but very cozy. There was enough space for the three of us. Also the location was perfect."
533880,1893030,2012-08-05T00:00:00.000Z,Extremrly nice and clean apartment with a very good description as to find the place. Good breakfast as well.
1158893,61321249,2016-02-02T00:00:00.000Z,Thank you for sharing your lovely home.   The welcome pack was useful and comprehensive.   Our flight was delayed and we missed our connection in Doha and arrived in Stockholm one day later.   Dany the host was very kind to accept a last minute change to stay only for one night instead of two and gave us a refund.   Thank you.
242188,286390710,2018-07-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Li’s is an incredibly gracious host; she’s very knowledgeable, gives great travel tips, and is warm and welcoming. Li understands what it is to be a traveler, and I really appreciate her accommodating nature. I felt safe and happy in this cozy room with a great view, and it’s close to everything Stockholm has to offer. I highly recommend staying with Li. 

Thank you for the wonderful stay!"
1212891,6232494,2013-08-04T00:00:00.000Z,Maud was great help and her room was very comfortable. She was very flexible with our schedule and went the extra mile to help us out. I give her a full recommendation.
1205051,6914811,2013-08-30T00:00:00.000Z,"Awesome place, fantastic value for the money!  Very clean and cozy place, exactly as advertised/pictured.  In perfect neighborhood with all sorts of cool cafes/restaurants/bars surrounding it.  Super easy access to central Stockholm as well.  Viktor was very easy to work communicate with, flexible and did everything he could to help.  Definitely would stay there again next time I'm in Stockholm!"
916806,329537357,2018-09-29T00:00:00.000Z,Julia's Place is good. We recommend to arrive before dark since it may be difficult to find the exact location. The place looks similar as in the pics. Julia responds to conversation quickly.
1182616,104601796,2016-09-27T00:00:00.000Z,Peter is a lovely guy and did all he could to make us comfortable when we arrived. However there were eight people sharing one bathroom and toilet and there were some issues with cleanliness. Had we known the number of people sharing a small flat we would not have booked. The accommodation would suit backpackers who are looking for easy access to the city.
1234960,37171951,2015-07-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Nous avons passé un excellent séjour, la maison est très agréable, calme et située dans un quartier résidentiel, c'est la campagne à la ville...Tous les jours nous avons eu la chance de voir une biche dans la jardin ! La maison est proche du métro et d'un supermarché ce qui est très pratique. Jacob fait en sorte que l'on se sente comme chez soi, et donne tous les conseils nécessaires pour passer des vacances parfaites. Nous n'hésiterons pas à revenir chez Jacob,  en hiver ,par exemple, pour découvrir la ville dans un contexte différent. Nous recommandons chaudement la maison de Jacob à tous ceux qui veulent découvrir Stockholm. Il est un hôte parfait, très attentionné."
975317,39044503,2015-07-20T00:00:00.000Z,This was a spacious and comfortable apartment in a very convenient location. Tom and Paulina were very gracious hosts.
299154,22974521,2014-11-18T00:00:00.000Z,Very nice place! Daniel was very friendly and have me good suggestions for a nice breakfastplace near by.
1182616,24211889,2014-12-22T00:00:00.000Z,One of the best living experience in Europe. It is so convenient to go to Peter's house from Airport. And it is only 3 minutes walk to the metro station and easy to find restaurants and markets nearby. Also the house is tidy and warm which makes us like home. Very good.
916806,400933860,2019-01-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Un très belle hébergement avec une magnifique vue. Propre, fonctionnelle, rien a redire"
313763,268510190,2018-05-25T00:00:00.000Z,Martin's flat is very clean and spacious and has a great balcony. It is also conveniently situated for public transport. Had a great time!
954832,50195702,2015-10-10T00:00:00.000Z,"We had a lovely stay at Mikael's apartment! Mikael made everything very easy and met us on street to guide us to the apartment. The apartment was perfect for my husband and I. The bed was very comfortable and the apartment very clean, quiet and had everything we needed - even an umbrella and shopping bag! We hope to stay here again on a future trip to Stockholm!"
819676,86133027,2016-07-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Andy and Vannie's place provides an excellent base for discovering central Stockholm (particularly Gamla Stan and the surrounding areas).
The apartment is ideally located (Slussen metro station is just around the corner!), the place is modern, cozy and comfy, the amenities excellent (great bathroom!) and although I didn't get the chance to meet my hosts in person, they were quick to respond to my queries and flexible enough to allow for accommodating my baggage until after my nominal check out time.
Overall a great experience and I will surely plan a visit at their place again. In fact, I'm looking forward to it; wish I had more days to spend there already!"
608672,20645150,2014-10-03T00:00:00.000Z,Karl was a gracious host who gave us a great intro to the city and provided a map. He has some great recommendations for food and sightseeing and went above and beyond with hospitality. The flat is perfect for two people and has a small kitchenette with a refrigerator. Karl was so nice he even left us a welcome gift! Best thing was the bed was very very comfortable! Highly recommend!
822497,11867576,2014-04-17T00:00:00.000Z,The location is perfect and right next to the metro station. We had a lovely stay for 3 nights.
858902,266648417,2018-05-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Lotta is a great host. She had the best tips for me, like the perfect route for runners!"
1170027,13567292,2014-05-31T00:00:00.000Z,Welcoming hosts!
575371,164734954,2017-06-29T00:00:00.000Z,Tomas is extremely friendly and welcoming. He really cares for you before and during your stay. The flat is really nice and big and the room was as described. For me and my wife the location of the flat is very convenient and the area really nice. Only thing is that the bed is not the most comfortable we've slept on. Besides that it was a great stay and would definitely recommend it.
1170766,413824371,2019-02-18T00:00:00.000Z,"Everything went well during our stay. Check in was possible although Annika was not at home at that time. The room was well prepared with towels, bedlinen, some fruits on the table and even some bread available! Annika was available on the phone is anything would have caused a problem what didn't happen.
Check-out also went well so all in all a perfect stay. By the way, getting into the city is just a short walk or taking the Tunnelbana. So kind of a perfect stay in Stockholm."
1124388,11216549,2014-03-25T00:00:00.000Z,Carl was very welcoming and helpful! Apartment was great and comfy enough for three. Thanks Carl
347192,233855723,2018-02-11T00:00:00.000Z,Lovely light flat in a good area. Good kitchen with everything you might need. Second bed as clear in the details was a bit of a squish for two. Good recommendations from Matilda for restaurants. Though we didn’t meet her she was responsive warm and friendly.
608672,48730307,2015-09-28T00:00:00.000Z,Karl is a perfect host - he gave me detailed info about the city and let me stay later than the official check out time. The apartment has a very good location - just next to the metro but really you can reach almost all tourist attraction on foot and Stockholm worth it for sure. Apartment is small but cozy. There is a reparation in the building as it is 18th century and window was covered with the paper - but I was coming to the room only to sleep so ho problems. Would definitely come back again!
242188,460058773,2019-05-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Li is very welcoming, the place is clean and convincingly located."
299154,259998036,2018-05-03T00:00:00.000Z,Appartement très bien situé et conforme aux photos. Daniel nous a très bien accueillies et conseillées au sujet de diverses activités à faire au sein de sa ville.
1054406,142681333,2017-04-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Our stay was perfect! The flat is well describe, clean and nice! Thomas and Madeleine are amazing hosts and they will help you if you need! The house is near the bus and the metro so you can easily go to Stockholm central. I strongly recommend this place!"
916806,219366738,2017-12-17T00:00:00.000Z,Communication with Julia was very fluent although we didn’t actually meet. She gave us all the details to get to the flat and plenty of information on the area. The flat was spotless and very cosy. Strongly recommended!!
1212891,62161711,2016-02-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud war über alle Maße zuvorkommend und hilfsbereit, das Zimmer und die gesamte Wohnung sauber und sehr schön eingerichtet! Auch die Nähe zur Innenstadt spricht für sich. Nur zu empfehlen! 
Tack för allt, Maud!"

1119738,499194229,2019-07-31T00:00:00.000Z,L’emplacement du logement est idéal pour visiter Stockholm et ses environs. De plus l’environnement y est tranquille et Anna est une super hôte. Toujours prête à aider et de bon conseils. Nous recommandons sans aucun soucis. Et si vous voyagez avec un enfant en bas âge et bien il y a tout ce qu’il faut.
1212891,434712168,2019-04-08T00:00:00.000Z,Maud is lovely. We were checked in by her daughter who provided us with all the information we required for a smooth stay. The location is very close to the tram station with direct links to the city centre. The accommodation itself is v clean with a comfortable bedroom and good kitchen amenities. Thanks Maud!
1182616,48481389,2015-09-26T00:00:00.000Z,Peter's apartment was in a great location downtown.  It was a very clean apartment with a private deck that was wonderful to stay at.  He was very easy to working with on checking in.
164448,353469128,2018-11-28T00:00:00.000Z,Ich schließe mich meinen  Vorrednern an.
1096827,6302715,2013-08-07T00:00:00.000Z,"This place was absolutely phenomenal! three of us were traveling to Stockholm for a week to attend a conference held at KTH and this location was perfect. Steps away from the metro  (green line 18, stop Sandsborg) that will take you to the central station with plenty of shops and restaurants around if you need it. The apartment itself was spacious and gorgeous. The beds were comfy, two of us stayed in the room and one in the pull out sofa bed. We especially appreciated the awesome stereo system which allowed us to listen to the music throughout the house, including in the bathroom where there is the most amazing Jacuzzi tub I have EVER seen! The area surrounding the apartment was so cute, I wish I would've had more time in the area to experience Enskede! Anita herself was so welcoming and helpful in the planning process as well as patient when I showed up about an hour late due to lost luggage on the plane. I would not hesitate to stay with her again the next time I am in Stockholm! Thank you so much for everything ! Staying here made our time in Stockholm truly special !"
795354,43050892,2015-08-17T00:00:00.000Z,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1251466,55745261,2015-12-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Dean and his wife are very nice and welcoming hosts! Dean was very patient and nice to us, he waited for us when we were late to the meeting. His wife made tea for us when we arrived. We slept in nice comfortable bed and we were greatly satisfied with our stay."
1054406,169094816,2017-07-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Thomas and his wife Madeleine are excellent hosts and we felt very welcome! The apartment is exactly as described (and suoer clean) and they welcomed us with a food package!  You will find basics like pepper, salt, vinegar,... in the kitchen. The apartment offers a lot of space and there is also a table to sit outside. We used the public transport to go to Stockholm, which was very easy. 

You should go to the little cafe in walking distance - it is very nice! 

Thanks Thomas and Madeleine for having us!"
819676,421961446,2019-03-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Very kind and helpful hosts. Always up for a chat and morning coffee, but also respectfull of privacy when you want it.  Location is outstanding. Hip part of town, close to the metro. You can get anywhere in Stockholm in 20 mins or less. Fast wifi, and your own bedroom and bathroom. The shower has glass doors which was nice after staying in some other places in Sweden with \"wet bathrooms\" haha.  Would definitely recommend to others and consider staying there again myself if I ever make it back to Stockholm."
1158893,199517123,2017-10-02T00:00:00.000Z,The house was exactly as discribed and Danys directions made it very easy to find. We had such a comfortable and relaxing stay. The area is so quiet but still close enough to the centre of Stockholm.
974175,57013399,2015-12-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Sofie was kind and warm in all her communication. The flat was easy to find and it is in a lovely,  quiet,  safe , residential area. We could walk everywhere and there are lots of cool friendly cafes in the immediate area. The flat is more beautiful than in the photos. Warm, clean and easy to be in. It smells lovely. Sofie very kindly left biscuits and milk . We would very happily stay there again and highly recommend it. Thank you Sofie!"
1054406,87886087,2016-07-22T00:00:00.000Z,"The place was just perfect! In the middle of everything for both parents and tweens. Just few metres to a refreshing bath in the lake or 15 minutes by subway to city center. The apartment had everything we needed, including outdoor furniture for relaxing time in the sun. And not to mention those incredible serviceminded hosts! Thank you so much Thomas and Madeline, we really enjoyed our stay!"
581243,2382992,2012-09-23T00:00:00.000Z,"I really enjoyed the stay at Edwin's apartment. It was super clean and tidy, everything what you need during your stay is provided by him. Edwin himself is also a really nice person, he came to Karlaplan to meet us and showed the way to the apartment. The area where the apartment is located is very quiet, clean and safe. Just when you get outside you can get to the metro. We visited mostly Stockholm on foot and so it was a perfect location to get to the most important places."
1205051,35368181,2015-06-18T00:00:00.000Z,The apartment was exactly as depicted in the photos and victor was a communicative and responsive host. We enjoyed the neighborhood and were glad we stayed there.
608672,250221479,2018-04-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Karl’s place was in the perfect location! We were able to explore the city all on foot and had no problems getting anywhere! Karl was kind, he met us for check in and gave us some tips of things to see and do. The shower is so small, and it’s kind of hard to keep the water where it should be; but it was a warm shower and functional!"
1212891,308307901,2018-08-16T00:00:00.000Z,A great stay with Maud and Sammy :D 100% recommended!!

1124388,357404758,2018-12-10T00:00:00.000Z,"The place is good for the price and well located, just perhaps for our standards a few things could be improved. But it was fine in general."
1255668,174582329,2017-07-26T00:00:00.000Z,"A really fascinating place with a personal touch, very good transport connections (17 min to city centralen), quiet surroundings, quick and personal contact :-) , we felt completely \"at home\"!"
1307331,365368168,2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Très bon séjour dans la maison de Marcus, idéalement située à moins de 10min à pieds du métro. Toutes les photos sont conformes à la réalité. Parfait pour 8 personnes (2 salles de bain c’est un plus). Et les échanges avec Marcus en amont ont permis de bien préparer le séjour. Merci."
1182616,11744769,2014-04-14T00:00:00.000Z,"The stay at Peter's place in Stockholm was nice. The bedroom was clean and access to the kitchen really helped us budget. It is close to the metro and is only a 20min walk to the city centre. 
My only complains were that Peter was not around during our stay which concerned me about security since there were no locks on the bedroom doors. We were not aware of other guests in the apartment until about 12 hours before our arrival. Other than that, everything was great!"
647314,29270075,2015-04-06T00:00:00.000Z,Great location great host! The room is super spacious just like in the photo and the flat is super cute! Mallika made everything super easy! Thanks you so much!

It is located extremely close to a shopping center, restaurants, and fast food locations. Edwin was very helpful during my stay, and he even went as far as to pick me up from the Arlanda Express train station to make me feel safe. He is an excellent host and I highly recommend him to anyone looking at staying in Stockholm."
536283,28473157,2015-03-24T00:00:00.000Z,second time we book Paolo's apartment and as usual the place was perfectly clean and tidy and the communication with the host was easy . I totally recommend this place !

954832,440134725,2019-04-20T00:00:00.000Z,We enjoyed our 4 day stay very much. Mikael was the perfect host. He greeted us upon our arrival and was full of great tips for the city and the area! If you are looking for a place near all the sights of the city this is the perfect apartment for you!
688947,74556156,2016-05-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Unfortunately, we didn't get to meet Alexandre until the final day of our stay, but the place was exactly as described. There was a problem, though, as the Wi-Fi had been disconnected before we got there, but Alexandre did offer to let us use his phone for internet, and if our schedules had matched up I am sure he would have been more than accommodating in this respect. It was a pleasant trip and I would definitely go back there if I wanted to go back to the Stockholm area - it's so close to public transport and a supermarket, and the décor is great."

It is very family-friendly and my girls really appreciated having their own bedroom with lots of toys. We found the neighbours to be friendly which also made us feel welcome. The location is great - close to a lovely nature reserve, a COOP supermarket and also very close to the metro (its only a short metro trip into the city centre). 

Samuel is a wonderful host. Great communication and very friendly. He met us at the apartment for check-in and provided lots of useful information. He was very willing to answer any questions and was very helpful when we needed advice about finding a Doctor for our daughter. He also left some breakfast supplies which was greatly appreciated after a long day of travel. We definitely recommend this Airbnb."

Quiet upper class neighbourhood which was great to come back to at night. I felt very comfortable and safe staying at Lotta's place as a solo female traveler. Lotta also bought a mini fridge for the room halfway through my stay so I could store some food, which was really appreciated."

There is a small park area behind the apartment with a fountain, where families gather and enjoy the outdoors.  The apartment is also close to the Royal Music School, and Stadion T-bana station.  For access to food, Eatalia (take away or eat on the patio outside) is excellent and the owners are super friendly and helpful.  There are two very good bakeries nearby.  My favorite is Fosch Patisserie.  They are to the right around the corner from the round apartment building.  Their coffee and pastries are fantastic.  The other, more traditional bakery, ( don't remember the name) is good but only has coffee from a pump carafe.  I highly recommend Terry's apartment for families and/or couples.  Terry kitchen is well stocked and he had food in the refrigerator for us to eat as well as sharing whatever else there was in his pantry.  He made us feel very welcomed when we arrived.  Thank you Terry!"

Our children loved their room with bunk beds and toys. Perfect location near everything - great restaurants, cool bars, transport, good shops, markets and nice parks - but on a lovely peaceful residential street. Oskar & Lisa were very welcoming, helpful and quick with communication. We highly recommend their apartment and would love to stay there again."

My room also had its own fridge and a water kettle, which made it easy to be self sufficient in many ways. I think Andy and Vannie were perfect Aribnb hosts.

The location was also very good. It was on a silent street next to the very busy Götgatan - which had wonderful coffee shops. The metro station was just a few steps away, but the Old Town and the city center were also within a walking distance."

608672,221641416,2017-12-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Karl’s place was just strategically located in the heart of the city. Very nearby to the subway metro what connects most of the parts of the city. Its small, but surprisingly it accommodates 2 persons adequately. Plus with the small kitchen which was very useful to use to quickly prepare some basic meals. As written from other comments, bathroom is basic, with relatively small shower area. But it was okay for me, as i am not so tall.

Karl was also very communicative, giving us some basic info of the city and even giving us reco on some restos open during xmas time.

Highly recommend for anyone who wants yo stay in Stockholm."

Toujours de bonne humeur, elle aime discuter et veille à ce que ses invités se sentent bien. 
Le quartier de Södermalm est vraiment super : très joli, très animé, avec beaucoup de magasins, restaurants et bars sympathiques à moins de 10 minutes à pied. C'est le quartier de Stockholm que nous avons préféré.

Zawsze była do naszej dyspozycji, w każdym momencie mogliśmy liczyć na jej pomoc i radę. Mieszkanie znajduje sie w cichej okolicy, dotarcie do centrum zajmuje ok.20/25 min (10 min dojście do metra, 15 min zajmuje dojazd do centum). Dodatkowym plusem jest przemiły kot imieniem Sammy, którego nie sposób nie polubić :)"

He offered to pick us up from the bus station and showed us around in his apartment. We had time to ask everything we needed to ask, he also checked in with us via text mssg during our stay. The apartment looked exactly like on the pictures. It is a small place and has everything one might need. The value for your money is great. 
The public transport connection is awesome. Only 10-15min by bus (station right in front of the house) to T-Centralen. Right in front of the house are also a big enough supermarket, drug store and restaurants.

The flat was bright with daylight even in the middle of January. Annika's photographs capture the flat very well. My experience was that the flat was spacious, well heated with plenty of hot water too. The decor is calm. The bed very comfortable - though I did manage to bump my head off a low corner over it, despite Annika's warnings.

The streets outside are relatively quiet though you can look down on the distant hustle and bustle. There are lots of restaurants, cafes, shops and bars nearby. So it's very well placed for exploring Sodermalm.

Estuvo siempre pendiente de nosotros, nos recibió con un café afectuosamente y nos explicó los mejores planes para nuestros cuatro días en Estocolmo. Siempre pendiente del tiempo, también se ocupó de cuál era la mejor combinación y el mejor horario para volver al aeropuerto. Si volviera a esta maravillosa ciudad, volvería a ver a Li."
608672,12280265,2014-04-28T00:00:00.000Z,"My brother and I stayed in Karl's room for 5 days in April. The room was only yards away from all our favourite stores, so we had a great time staying here. Karl was very nice and also told us some interesting facts about the building, the street and Stockholm itself. The room itself was perfect for our stay. We used the little kitchen to heat up pancakes for breakfast! All together, I would highly recommend Karl as a host!"

Maud is a good host and she let me borrowed her bike. The ride to reach the city centre is very nice and takes 20 minutes maximum by the river. It was my highlight. The aera is nice and shops, restaurant  are very close by like 5mn walk maximum. I would recommend the place if you need a quiet place and not far from the city. She's cool;)"

The appartment is well situated, so we could take the bus just around the corner for all our excursions.Very near there was an ICA, so we could always buy food for the meals. And in the kitchen, which is top equipped, we had everything we needed.
It´s a pitty, that we couldn´t talk or even read swedish, because Carl´s library is worth to be read!

A 20 minute ride to center city, which was always the perfect length of time for me to plan out my day. And if you like Indian food, which I do, you're in for a treat - amazing food and great conversation as well! You'll never be hungry. I often had to skip lunch since I ate so much for breakfast, which was perfect since it allowed me more time to check out places in Stockholm. Most importantly of all, Vidhatri and Bala are just good people who really go out of their way to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. I would definitely recommend staying at their place, when it's available. Last but not least, if you enjoying running, there's hundreds of acres (if not thousands) of soft surface paths in a countryside setting right behind their place. I ran 12-18 kilometers a day when I was there and there always seemed to be new trails I haven't tested before. Always got the day started on the right footing!"

The metro is indeed around 5-8min walk, the area was quiet and not far from the centre by metro."

Paolo's apartment was perfect for me - located in a funky area of Stockholm, it was walking distance to good food and coffee, and the highlights of Stockholm.  The apartment was clean and comfortable, and I loved the style of the flat, and the cute old lift in the building.  The kitchen was well stocked and access to the computer was very handy for travelling.  Paolo was the perfect host too, very responsive to any request and he made the whole process of checking-in and out short and sweet.  I would definitely stay here again if given the chance to be in Stockholm again."

Andy was kind enough to walk me to a post office when I needed it and both were welcoming friendly and relaxed. The room was cozy and clean. Perfect for relaxing after a long flight and exploring Stolkholm. The location is EXCELLENT. If you want to be close to Gamla Stan Etc this is perfect. Lots of cafes, restaurants, movies Etc. Perfect blend of touristic and residential. I would be happy to return the next time I visit."
916806,322434597,2018-09-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Een mooi appartement voor 2 personen. Het is 1 grote ruimte. Hier rekening mee houden als je niet als stel reist, maar bijv 2 vrienden. Het huis ligt tegen een natuurreservaat, geweldig uitzicht vanaf zijkant huis. Je hebt beschikking over terras om lekker buiten te zitten. 
Stockholm centrum is goed te bereiken per metro. Metro en groot winkelcentrum op 10 min lopen. 
We hebben Julia niet ontmoet, ze werken met een sleutelkastje. 

Stockholm zeker een stad om terug te komen. Geweldige combinatie stad en natuur."
624886,169318063,2017-07-12T00:00:00.000Z,"The place is really nice, location is very good if you travel with kids. The area is very nice, playgrounds and shops very close. Connection to the airport and city center are very easy. It is a very nice place to stay if you want to visit Stockholm, nice walk by the sea to the city center and not packed with tourist. Oskar was very nice and helped us a lot."
274876,92595632,2016-08-09T00:00:00.000Z,"It was a pleasure staying at Emma's apartment in Sodermalm, the nicest borough to stay for visiting Stockholm. The apartment is very comfortable for a family of 5 or 6. It's cosy sitting outside on the balcony and right around the corner there are shops, a supermarket and good restaurants. It's only 15 minutes walking to the old city, but the City Bike and bus stop are only a few hundred meters away. Emma is very helpful and welcoming, even at 11 p.m. when you arrive from a late flight."
145320,290896600,2018-07-15T00:00:00.000Z,"Apartment with a wonderful location. Kim responded quickly (she was not there during our stay) to our questions and had useful tips for us. Indeed; in the middle of it all :-) 

Söder is the place to stay! :-)"

She was very accommodating and met us at the train station to deliver keys and gave great suggestions and directions. The place was perfect for us - very clean and nicely decorated. She even gave us cards to use the City Bikes for the few days, which was awesome. I definitely recommend this place!"
1244657,5974274,2013-07-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Nic&Usha's house is a perfect place to stay. They have been very quick in replying to every question. Arriving there has been very easy and you can choose to go on foot from the central station or by t-bana. Even if they were abroad everything has worked perfectly. The room is a very comfortable and quiet one with a well-functioning wireless. You are near the old town Gamla-stan or the Sodermalm neighbourhood with its cafe'. If you like cycling you can use the air compressor  in front of the building :-). And if you like beer, just behind the corner, there are two of the best pubs I've ever seen. Leaving the house and the town has been a bit sad! In summary, I strongly recommend Nic&Usha's house!
Cheers, stefano"
1124388,131430301,2017-02-12T00:00:00.000Z,Loved this place to stay was 20mins to any central destination and perfect for a couple.

Enjoy !"
1212891,41065396,2015-08-04T00:00:00.000Z,"Maud gave me a very friendly welcome from the time I entered. She then started to explain how things are working and showed me my room for the next days, which were very comfortable. I didn't ever sleep so well during a journey as in this quiet little room.  But also her two sweet cats gave me the feeling of being at home. 

To the public transportation system (subway) it's just a few minutes of walk and also two supermarkets are quite close.

I only can recommend a stay with Maud if you're going to go to beautiful Stockholm!"
610948,11764822,2014-04-14T00:00:00.000Z,Lina's flat was both beautiful and perfectly located. The flat was maybe a 5 minute walk from the nearest T-Bana station and offered great views of the city center (only 3 stops away). Communication was a snap and I will definitely consider staying here during my next Stockholm trip.
164448,307281971,2018-08-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Li was flexible about arrival time and check-in and gave good directions to reach her flat from the Södra station. In the check-in process she provided a map of Stockholm, oriented us to public transportation options, and gave her recommendations on things to do. 

Li also let us switch rooms at check-in for a bit more space. We enjoyed the common area, fridge, and microwave that she makes available to her guests - perfect for staying in on a rainy day. As you are in the upper floor of the flat, it can get a little stuffy when the weather is hot (as it was while we were there). Probably not an issue other times of the year or in cooler summers. 

We found the location very convenient - about a 20 min walk to Gamla Stan - but we also loved exploring Södermalm, which is a great neighborhood, with great dining options within a 5-10 min walk. All in all, we enjoyed our stay very much - it felt more like staying with family than an AirBnB."

862868,43032553,2015-08-17T00:00:00.000Z,"I never actually met Pernilla, but our communication was excellent prior to my stay. I arrived and received the keys with no issues whatsoever. The location of the apartment is perfect, literally right outside of a subway station and with major bus routes 1 or 2 minutes away. This area of Kungsholmen became my favorite part of Stockholm, in the city but with a more neighborhood feel.

As for the apartment itself...absolutely perfect. It's a studio, so it's small of course, but there was an amazing \"a place for everything and everything in its place\" vibe. I stayed for 4 weeks but never had to contact Pernilla as everything I possibly could have needed was there, and her written instructions for things like laundry and garbage/recycling were spot on. It was a wonderful AirBnB stay, and I definitely would have stayed longer if the place had been available."
568341,447376741,2019-05-03T00:00:00.000Z,This was a wonderful experience. We were only in Washington for a short time and this enabled us to make a connection to this great city

It's located in a quiet neighborhood, but very convenient to public transportation. It took me maybe 8-10 minutes to walk to the Gullmarsplan station, and only about 5-8 minutes to take the metro to Södermalm or Gamla Stan... so I was in all the best parts of town within 15 minutes of my doorstep. It was very easy to communicate with Annika when I had questions, and she is very warm and welcoming. I highly recommend her place to anyone visiting Stockholm!"

I came for work but Lotta gave supplied a lot of flyers and booklets about Stockholm which were very fun to read during the evenings. Also, she drew interesting places for me to visit on a map. Then there were even clan towels on the bed. The bed was very comfortable and from the room you have  a great view of the street. The apartment is located in a beautiful building and is decorated nicely and makes you feel at home.  In the neighbourhood there is a 7eleven and a coop for groceries. It's very close to the waterside wehere the Grand Hotel is, and about 10 minutes walk to either City/ Castle / Skepsholmen.  Although I came for work, I had a very pleasant stay that felt like a holiday."

Puedes caminar facil a todo, pero si llevas maleta de rueditas llegar caminando o salir caminando es un terror jaja
Viven dos gatitos, lindos pero un poco metichillos, metieron sus patitas dos veces a mis vasos de agua y se llevaron mi esponja del baño.
Es piensas en este lugar para salir de noche y regresar tarde no es la opción porque les gusta dormir maximo 10pm
Si eres un maniatico de la limpieza, tendras un par de temas porque hay algunas cositas tantito polvientas.
Todo lo demas perfecto, pregunta a la host por el codigo de seguridad de la entrada y el piso para llegar al depa o te perderas :)"

The size of the apartment was perfect for me but i think it would still be good for a couple. it actually looks much better than in photos. it's very light and has a good energy. The thing that attracted me the most is that Magnus does not charge any extra fees eg cleaning,towels...I just wished there was a microwave. but there is a pizza place (which was average) and a Thai place (which was tasty) down the road. there is also a supermarket next to the train station. Do stay here, it's a great deal. Thanks for having me Magnus! 5 stars"

Very close to the metro, a big supermarket on the corner of the street, and a very good cafe (Kaffeebar) next door. Although we didn't meet Cecilia in person, communication was good and we could pick up the keys in the restaurant next door. 
The only impractical thing is that there is no shower curtain in the bathroom, so the bathroom was full of water after showering."

At the same time we enjoyed the trip very much with the help of Bala Sir who treated us as younger brothers.
They have given full freedom of using all the facilities at the home.
I have no more words to describe the Hospitality given by Bala Sir and Vidhatari Madam.
Thanks You again. You people were beyond our imagination."

Stocked kitchen with everything you need, and she even stocked us with a few snacks, and drinks! Couch and bed pretty comfortable. The bathroom/Stockholm shower is sufficient, but it was a bit uncomfortable for my not so small husband. The area is a quick walk to the metro, lots of good food options and shopping close. We had a great time:)"

Nettan is a wonderful host, offer me all the help I needed and allow me to use her kitchen. The house is really clean and cozy, with also a great view. The location is also great, only about 5 minute walk to the metro station, 8 minutes ride to the city centre. It is also really close to the harbour of Tallink Silja line, so I don't have to carry my luggage all across the city. 
So if you are finding an apartment located in a quiet neighbourhood but still near to the city centre and the pier, Nettan's place is the perfect one."
1248490,7123786,2013-09-07T00:00:00.000Z,The apartment is beautiful and spacious with a great view.  Maria was nice and friendly and offered any help we might need.  She had the fridge stocked with lots of good food for breakfast.

Great stay!"
1149820,256949582,2018-04-24T00:00:00.000Z,"Siamo rimaste in questo appartamento per cinque giorni. È piccolino, ma molto ben sistemato e perfetto per le nostre esigenze, vicino alla metro e a diversi supermercati, in un bel quartiere giovane e tranquillo. Klara è stata molto disponibile, ci ha dato diversi suggerimenti su cosa vedere e che posti frequentare nei dintorni. Super consigliato!!!!"

Best place to stay in Stockholm!"
259025,2915328,2012-11-19T00:00:00.000Z,Thank you for hosting us! Ali is a very friendly and helpful host. Nice room and close to the Tunnelbana station/city center. I can strongly recommend Ali and his rooms :)
1212891,70948417,2016-04-22T00:00:00.000Z,Maud made us feel welcome and the room was so nice! It was very easy to get to her house (by tram) and the neighborhood was really cozy. I highly recommend this room and host to everyone! Thank you Maud :)
700113,176687446,2017-07-31T00:00:00.000Z,"This studio has everything you need for basic catering and a very comfortable double sized bed. There is also a small divan and table and chairs. I loved having fresh air at night from the windows/ door leading onto the balcony. There is a little supermarket close by as well as a bakery and other restaurants and cafes. I was able to walk everywhere. My host looked after me in a couple of ways well above expectations. I will be back, especially as the price is so reasonable compared to a hotel."
1173290,15254996,2014-07-06T00:00:00.000Z,"Lovely big flat with four separate bedrooms, a large kitchen and a cosy sitting room upstairs. We were in Stockholm for a 2-week summer school at the university. This flat was just what we needed - in a nice location, close to both the centre of town and the university (about 30 mins by tube). Making a booking for the washing facilities is a little complicated, but perfectly manageable if you're computer literate.

The hosts are very friendly and helpful. Christian was great at communicating in advance about the arrangements, and quick to reply to emails. I would thoroughly recommend this property."

1184553,282834478,2018-06-28T00:00:00.000Z,"Annbritt's place was an awesome place to stay while we were in Stockholm. It was extremely close tonic transportation but my girlfriend and I decided to walk to Gamla Stan every day. It was about a 10 minute walk and was extremely simple and pretty. 

The apartment was extremely clean and the tea kettle and water pitcher were a great addition."
763407,8663678,2013-11-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Everything was just perfect. The apartment was super cozy and the location couldn't be better. Unfortunately, we didn't see Gabriella, but she gave us a lot of recommendations what to do via e-mail and was always available by phone in case of questions. I highly recommend the apartment and Gabriella as host. We had a great time!"
242188,137897390,2017-03-18T00:00:00.000Z,Comfortable home in a great location/neighborhood. Lidia was so helpful with logistics too.

536283,434692776,2019-04-08T00:00:00.000Z,"My girlfriend and I had a lovely stay at Paolo's apartment. Fantastic apartment, very well presented in a fantastic location, in Sodermalm. Walking distance to everything we needed and lots of bars, restaurants and shops in close proximity. Paolo's help with any issues we had was exceptional and response time to messages was almost instantaneous.  Check in and check out couldn't have been easier, with Paolo's information for these superb. The use of the computer proved very helpful to search for our plans for the day ahead. The bed was slightly small to what we are used to but didn't have a huge impact on our stay. Would stay here again and would recommend to all our friends and family. All in all a great stay!"
164448,39189367,2015-07-21T00:00:00.000Z,Lidia was very kind and gave us directions to the main attractions in Stockholm. The room was small but perfect for a short stay.
220851,49839696,2015-10-06T00:00:00.000Z,"O quarto e a cama são realmente grandes e a localização do apartamento é excelente. Vi John muito pouco, então não posso dizer sobre ele como anfitrião. Para tomar banho, é preciso habilidades de malabarista, mas a pressão da água é boa. Infelizmente, o apartamento não tem wi-fi, o que torna a vida de um turista um pouco mais difícil. Em geral, foi uma experiência positiva de hospedagem!"
1212891,160431131,2017-06-14T00:00:00.000Z,Alltid mycket trevligt hos Maud och Sammie
164448,276221789,2018-06-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Li is an incredibly gracious host with an encyclopedic knowledge of Stockholm’s attractions and, probably more importantly, its well designed but fairly complicated public transportation system. Her apartment is comfortable, clean, and has a lovely living area to relax, read,  and enjoy a cup of coffee or tea while you recharge for late night outings in Stockholm. The place is a few minutes walk from parks, public swimming areas, attractive neighborhoods, a spectacular statue of Thor slaying a vicious sea serpent named Jörmungandr, and a walking path along a cliff that gives you the best views of the city at night. I couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay in beautiful Stockholm."
478105,94063189,2016-08-14T00:00:00.000Z,"Très bon accueil de Christian qui est venu nous chercher au métro tout proche. Appartement situé dans un quartier calme à 20 mn du centre de Stockholm en métro (à 10mn à pied de l'appartement). Restaurant, bar et supermarché à proximité. 
Un très bon séjour."

1054406,148096606,2017-04-30T00:00:00.000Z,"We hebben een hele fijne tijd gehad in Stockholm. Thomas en zijn vrouw Madeleine waren ontzettend gastvrij en behulpzaam. het is een heel fijn huis. In 30-40 minuten ben je in Stockholm. Het is makkelijk reizen met een SL kaart die onbeperkt toegang geeft tot bus, metro en trein.
Een aanrader is het fotografiemuseum met een brunch in het restaurant ( vooraf reserveren is aanbevolen). Prachtige locatie, mooi uitzicht voortreffelijke gerechten."
274876,12249529,2014-04-27T00:00:00.000Z,"We absolutely loved this place! Emma was very helpful and did reply quickly to messages. Her apartment is beautiful, clean and SoFo is a nice area to start any kind of day trips in Stockholm. The bus drive to Gamla Stan is approx 10 minutes, you can even walk. 
We were staying as a family of four (two little kids) and enjoyed our stay very much. 
Thank you so much, Emma. It was our first trip to Stockholm and a very nice experience!"

Die Wohnung ist gut ausgestattet, wir konnten in der Küche gut kochen um Geld in Restaurants zu sparen.
Die Lage ist perfekt, Södermalm ist sehr schön. Geschäfte, Bars und Restaurants sind direkt eine Straße weiter, man ist schnell zu Fuß am Wasser und in Gamla Stan.
Besonders Empfehlenswert ist abends auf dem Heimweg beim auch nicht weit entferntem Monteliusvägen den Sonnenuntergang anzusehen."
871262,9330232,2013-12-22T00:00:00.000Z,"Central and calm neighborhood, beautiful appartment, and Lotta is anice and reliable host. To be recommended."

974175,251575311,2018-04-08T00:00:00.000Z,The apartment was wonderful - we had everything we needed and Sofie was always available to help us and to give us the feeling to be welcomed guests.

The apartment is very well located, south of Sodermalm, 5mn from the Skanskul métro station, which is 3 stations from central Stockholm.
The apartment is bigger than it appears in the pictures and we enjoyed the little balcony.

We had a great stay."

723539,260937445,2018-05-05T00:00:00.000Z,"Mathias made our stay in Stockholm very comfortable. The communication with him was fast and efficient. House rules are clear and very reasonable. Sorting out the garbage is even a small quest, which makes you smile sometimes and adds a charm to living in his apartment. Apartment is very well located: 10 minutes by foot to Royal Drama Theatre, which is the beginning of Strandvägen, 13 minutes to Gamla Stan, 15 minutes to Djurgården. We stayed for 5 full days and never used public transportation or taxi, not a small change in Stockholm. In a few minutes by foot there are also have two reasonably priced food stores Coop (more expensive) and Hemköp (less expensive, larger choice). The apartment is definitely a good price/quality ratio for Stockholm. You should only know that probably a family of three is maximum what we would advise as a group, the place is not so large, but very homely. One very small caveat: if you need wifi, you should either buy a local SIM card, either have a generous roaming plan, as mobile modem works perfectly, but only with one device with USB port at a time.  Definitely recommend to grab Mathias's apartment if it is available."
1304431,82187032,2016-06-26T00:00:00.000Z,"This apartment was perfect for our family's trip to Stockholm - light, beautifully decorated, fully equipped, and perfectly situated on a quiet block in Sodermalm!  Madeleine was incredibly responsive to our questions and needs, and even provided a crib and high-chair for our 14 month old daughter.  Every member of our family (ages 1-60) felt at home in the inviting and comfortable space!  The neighborhood was ideal - quiet, near the subway, and with many shops and restaurants nearby."
299154,204851729,2017-10-20T00:00:00.000Z,"Very nice yet small place very close to public transit and Gamla Stan. Great bars and restaurants near the place in Sodermalm. 

Would certainly recommend."
873383,66013671,2016-03-18T00:00:00.000Z,Isabelle was a great host. She was quick to respond to my last min request and was able to meet me in town on her way home. Her apartment is well located with a very short walk to the metro. The room was a good size with a comfortable bed. Isabelle was great about any questions I had and I enjoyed getting to know her and her cats over the few days I was in Stockholm.
242188,216276853,2017-12-03T00:00:00.000Z,"Li is a very welcoming and dynamic lady who made sure I had a cosy and well-organised stay in her greatly-situated flat in the area of Södermalm. The single room is as pictured, with all that is required for comfort and convenience, along with some extra space and amenities in the shared sitting room. The flat is quiet although there are all sorts of shops and cafés nearby, and access to other parts of the city and the airport are outstanding. Big thumbs up from me!"

1153177,20987930,2014-10-09T00:00:00.000Z,"Other members of my party arrived earlier than me and expressed how gracious Terry is. He helped them figure out things to do in Stockholm, gave them cake, etc. The place is just lovely, very eclectic. The queen size bed is not the same queen you would expect in the US, more of a double-size. Kitchen is beautifully stocked. Terry left train passes that his guests could fill , just the little things we don't often consider. We felt very comfortable there. Thanks Terry!"
1261445,168703290,2017-07-10T00:00:00.000Z,"Marie Louise's apartment was perfect for a weekend away with my husband. It's a really well kept apartment and we were so touched to see that we had been greeted with a stocked fridge, fruit and snacks etc. Really nice touch which made as feel very welcome and right at home. The location is fantastic, really close to public transport and lots of things within walking distance. Thanks for having us!"
581243,11144416,2014-03-22T00:00:00.000Z,The reservation was canceled 59 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
533880,50215381,2015-10-10T00:00:00.000Z,"I stayed Jarl's place for 3 nights.  Above all, staying Jarl's place made my first visit to Stockholm further more wonderful one. 
His place was at calm area and just some minutes after I went into the room, I felt very comfortable with silent and warm atmosphere. Also could reach the city center in just about 20 minutes by walking and I enjoyed finding out the pretty shops, cafe, and famous indoor market on the way. 
Jarl was very practical host, so the communication before and after check-in was smooth. He gave me a tip about the city and kindly searched how I could get there. Also he was flexible. Thanks to his offer, I could keep my stuff at his place after check-out and it was so helpful for me."
647314,16291840,2014-07-25T00:00:00.000Z,"Unfortunately this has not been a great Airbnb experience....

The check-in went well as Mallika was ready to welcome us in the middle of the afternoon when our train arrived. This was perfect timing. When we arrived we liked the look of the apartment as it feels cosy and comfortable. Also I have to say that place is well situated.

However, things started to be a little awkward when she asked us to change the sheets of the bed when we will leave the room, as she was going to be out of town the day of our departure. As we like to be nice and accommodating with everybody, we accepted without hesitation...but it was still awkward as we knew we would also have to pass the vacuum, wipe the room and clean the floor (this is in the house rules. Make sure you read them).

As Mallika works and sleeps in the living room it can be little uncomfortable at moments if you are not used to share life with strangers. Also, as she had clients from 14h to 16h on the second day, she told us to be very quiet if we come to the apartment. This is not a big thing, but I think it's worth sharing with future guests.

During our stay, we did some mistakes, like forgetting to close and lock the second entrance door and misplacing stuff in recycle bags. When Mallika noticed, she came to us to make sure we understood how to do it properly the next time. This was little embarrassing and from that moment we started to walk on eggshells and we were not sure what we should and what we shouldn't do. In fact, this is why we did not appreciate this Airbnb experience as much as normally...

We have nothing against Mallika. In fact, we think that she's a nice person. However, during our stay, we were not super comfortable with some situations. Other people could react differently..."

581243,302733302,2018-08-06T00:00:00.000Z,Edwin's place is immaculate! The apartment is very well located both in a nice area and convenient for getting around town. Edwin himself was very helpful and gave very precise directions. Highly recommended!
1153177,87660971,2016-07-21T00:00:00.000Z,"As we stepped out of our taxi from the airport Terry came across to greet us. This was in keeping with all our dealings with Terry. From my first enquiry, he  replied without delay to all our questions and requests for clarifications.  For our arrival welcome a cooked dinner was waiting and a substantial amount of foodstuffs was in place. When leaving I asked Terry to book a taxi for us to the airport, which he did immediately. Truly a super host.

We were delighted with this accommodation for our 8 day visit to wonderful Stockholm. It is spacious, comfortable, modern and very quiet,  including importantly at night for sleeping. Situated just off the broad Valhallavägen with its grand linear park, it was an ideal base for us. A good supermarket is close by, at the junction of Nybrogatan and Karlavagen. 

We had a marvellous time in Stockholm. We love walking and did much. The nearest metro station is only a few minutes walk but we used it only once, as we did almost all our sightseeing on foot. 

Based on our very positive experiences throughout, on a return to Stockholm we would without hesitation request to stay in this grand accommodation again."

Die Wohnung ist gut gelegen und sehr schön eingerichtet. Das Zimmer ist sauber und gemütlich, sehr empfehlenswert! Sammy ist die flauschige Katze aller Zeiten und ein sehr angenehmer Mitbewohner. Das war jetzt das zweite Mal, dass Maud unsere Gastgeberin war und wir würden jederzeit wiederkommen. Großartige Gastgeberin, tolle Wohnung und ein schöner Urlaub!"

Julia and László"
514210,7738964,2013-10-01T00:00:00.000Z,"Hi,
I had the most amazing time at Margareta's. She is a fabulous host and helped me out with getting to know Stockholm a lot (even came to the city to pick me up on the day of my arrival). The room/balcony/kitchen etc. are exactly as shown in the pictures (or even better!). 
There is a supermarket (Hemsköp) right outside the apartment and also couple of pizzerias and eateries as well. There is also a bank (hence an ATM) nearby the supermarket.
The city can be reached in about 15-20 minutes and is very well connected by busses/metros. 
I highly recommend this place for all those wanting to enjoy the Stockholm city while based in a calm and quiet area.

Thank you Margareta and kids for the extremely wonderful time !!

Regards,
Vidya"

The room was just as described, the appartment just a good walk away from the city center in a good neighborhood and only 3 min from the next subway station. Since Peter couldn't be there to greet us himself, he made sure we'd get the key so that we could unpack. Would recommend his room to anyone."
1182616,67497551,2016-03-29T00:00:00.000Z,"Recommended. The flat was fairly close to the center, and the room was spacious and comfortable. The kitchen and bathroom were big as well. I didn't meet Peter, but everything accurately met the listing description. Great experience!Thanks!"

It is a cozy not-so-small penthouse at the very heart of Stockholm, balcony included. It is a warm place, and I felt like at home from the very beginning. Mathias was very thorough in his welcome package, and provided options to adapt to my check-in and check-out circumstances.
Highly recommend staying at his place.

So be aware that there may be quite a number of other people in (check with the host well beforehand). There's only one bathroom. It's  a good stay in terms of location and public transport access. Room door wasn't lockable (bathroom was). All in a good budget place."
776155,159576058,2017-06-11T00:00:00.000Z,"Ann-Sofie's place is well-placed in Odenplan near shopping and restaurants, and just a block away from the local subway station.  Perfect location for exploring Stockholm."

299154,263462347,2018-05-12T00:00:00.000Z,"Daniel's flat is perfectly located near Slussen on Södermalm. So you have Götgatan only a minute away, as well as the subway station to move around the city. As mentioned, you live within Daniel's own flat, so do not expect  sterile hotel like environment. Nevertheless, the appartment was very clean and comforable. A plus is the little balkony featuring some evening sun. In warm time, expect to have some background murmuring coming up from Götgatan, whilst that underlines the central location. As a host, Daniel was very welcoming. Yet we had only the basics to discuss, he responded fast and the encounter at check-in time was a pleasure."
647314,67060035,2016-03-26T00:00:00.000Z,"El Barrio es en el centro de la ciudad muy cerca al (Website hidden by Airbnb) habitación es tal cual como aparece en la fotografía. El baño es muy cómodo. 

Sin embargo, para alguien que viene viajando mas de 16 horas y luego unos cuantos trenes y metros en la ciudad es  bastante duro ser recibido, en la fría ciudad de Estocolmo. La calefacción es bastante precaria. Y la anfitriona no es amable. 

Comparado con otras experiencias previas en habitaciones privadas en Grenoble, París, Bretaña,  a donde asisto regularmente a conferencias, creo que a la anfitrióna le falta calidez y amabilidad. La habitación no es el lugar  adecuado para trabajar y concentrarse cuando en el caso mio vengo para preparar una conferencia.  La habitación es muy cara y muy restringidas las  posibilidades de utilizar demás espacios como sala y cocina."

After getting to her place, she made coffee and croissants, and oriented me with the neighborhood and Stockholm. The room was clean, cozy and had a lovely view. She was great communicating and just a pleasure to deal with. I heartily recommend Lidia, and will definitely stay at her place again on my next visit to Stockholm!"

The location of house is  genuinely teriffic. I was able to visit all theimportant attractions in Stockholm by walk so that it enabled me to save significsnt traffic costs. The room is cozy but it is very comfortable to use 4 persons for a long period. The small balcony is my favorite spot in his house. Who choose this house can easily use All kinds of traffic methods by 2~3 min walk. Highly, recommend Daniel's house to all users of Air-bnb."

The apartment is very clean and neat, and the facilities are excellent. The apartment is well situated, only about 5 min walk from a great shopping mall (with a good food court)  and the train and bus station.

I would recommend Marcelo as a host and would stay there anytime in future if I get the chance.

The flat itself  is unique and charismatic and as we were there over new year I can attest to how cosy and warm it is!

I felt very welcome right away. Lidia had freshly made tee and cookies and gave me helpful advices for my stay in Stockholm. 
I even got a map with nice places to visit and helpful info on the public transport. 
The apartment and room are very comfortable and I even enjoyed a nice breakfast with Lidia. I came for Stockholms furniture fair, the location is perfect - between the city centre and the fair.
I can really recommend staying a Lidias place, she is very nice and cares so much about you feeling welcome."

1212891,91089082,2016-08-03T00:00:00.000Z,"We loved to spend five days at the place of Maud!

The apartment is like the photos. The purple room is tidy and cosy. The neighbourhood is very quiet and beautiful (especially the docks during sunset!) with a big supermarket close.

At Maud's, everything is at our disposal for feeling like home and it works! 

The cleanliness is flawless, it's hard to believe that two cats live here because there is never cat hairs on the floor or litter odor. 

Maud is the kindest person in the world and we already regret not staying longer. She is really the best Airbnb host you can find.

Sammy and Dione are adorable. They are both soft and cute and Sammy loves playing!

This Airbnb experience was perfect. The only  \"bad point\" is that Maud  will really miss us."

Elle est située à une dizaine de minutes à pieds du métro : ce qui permet d'aller facilement dans le centre de Stockholm et de rentrer le soir au calme. 
Dany nous a donné toutes les informations utiles. Nous nous sommes sentis les bienvenus.

1182616,39463376,2015-07-23T00:00:00.000Z,"It was ok overall and luckily I only stayed a single night, but the experience taught me to more closely read the reviews of a listing before making a final booking, as the description left out an important detail..

..that there are others living in the flat, and that the host does not live there himself.

I'm a host myself and try and take good care of my guests, from the moment they book to the moment they leave.  Perhaps the most memorable attribute was the instructions to, upon arrival, only *take one of the keys* taped underneath the carpet in front of the door.

I'm including this here in the interest of future guests feeling more safe in an otherwise shady apartment building."

She stayed up and was very gracious when I got there. Also it took them two days to bring my luggage and it was my last night in Stockholm when they were going to deliver. They gave a 5 hour window for the delivery and Illona was there to collect while I was out enjoying the town. I highly recommend staying there, perfect for a solo traveller."
608672,10268838,2014-02-10T00:00:00.000Z,Perfect place super central in Stockholm. Great host that gave me sufficient info and maps. Thanx Karl! Can definately recommend this place. Close to the subway too and a short walk to everything! PS. Ilcaffe right by in Drotningens gatan was the perfect breakfast place. 2 minutes away!

Julia propose une documentation riche pour aiguiller les voyageurs.  Service de clé par boîte sécurisée très pratique. Logement bien équipé et bien décoré.

It’s very easy to get downtown - about 20 minutes you’re in T Centralen and Gamla Stan. She was very welcoming, very nice and whenever I had a doubt she helped me out. I loved my experience there!"
1182616,172580962,2017-07-21T00:00:00.000Z,"Super appartement avec un balcon privé dans la chambre. Bien situé, nous avons visité toutes les parties de la ville à pied. Peter n'était pas là, mais il répond rapidement aux messages si besoin! 
Je recommande :)"

Nice cosy apartment, minutes away from vibrant streets with bars and restaurants. Also really close to the inner city, by walk or via public transport."

En kort promenad till Medborgarplatsen eller Mariatorget gör att du snabbt tar dig till alla sevärdheter. Karin ställde upp perfekt med snabb återkoppling kring alla våra frågor och praktikaliteter. Ett stort tack till Karin!"

The only potential red flag was that the advertised rate was lower than actually charged (bummer!) so I recommend double check before booking!"
819676,235331603,2018-02-16T00:00:00.000Z,"I only got to meet Andy because Vanny was on a business trip. However, Andy was extremely accommodating and touched base with me numerous times prior to my arrival. He was able to give me clear directions and I easily found my way to the apartment. 

He greeted me warmly once I walked in and gave me a quick tour of the apartment along with a “How-to” with the appliances since American kitchen technology is eons behind Europe’s. 

After the tour, I quickly settled into my room and unpacked a bit of my suitcase. The room was very warm and cozy and could definitely accommodate 2 people but no more than 2. The private bathroom was great because I was able to lay out my bathroom products without cluttering up a shared bathroom. 

Overall, my entire stay was extremely lovely and pleasant. Andy and Vanny’s place was spotless, clean and in a very hip neighborhood! If I were to come back to Stockholm, I would definitely reserve Andy and Vanny’s place again. 

Perfect location, perfect atmosphere, perfect hosts, spotlessly clean... what more can you ask for?!"

478105,4573979,2013-05-13T00:00:00.000Z,"Amazing doesn't even start to describe the place. Christian went to pick us up on one of the subway stations closest to the place, which is less than 10 minutes by foot, both of them. It has everything you might need and more, like a massage chair, two Macs with internet available and and insanely awesome amplifier with speakers. Dream home. Only being there to know and see everything in it. All the house instructions are in a paper for further reference, and if have any doubts, just ask the host, he'll promptly answer your question.
It has two supermarkets that are very close, and if you're not willing to go far at night, there's a great restaurant/bar nearby. But you can also get to the city center very fast any time of the day. If you're not sure where to go, just ask Christian, he knows a lot of places to indicate and was happy to do so. You won't regret staying in this place. Me and my friends are 100% sure it was a better option than staying at a hostel."

Was nice to have such a big room to spread out in. The cats were no problem and Mallika was very relaxed and we hardly knew she was there.  All really comfortable : )"
916806,73431261,2016-05-08T00:00:00.000Z,"Die Beschreibung der Unterkunft war korrekt. Die Wohnung ist in Ordnung und sauber und gut eingerichtet, ideal für 2 Personen, für 4 ist sie etwas eng. Störend ist das überlaute Geräusch der Wasserpumpe im WC und die Überbewertung der 5 „holy rools“."

Everything is very clean and the technical standard is high."

757320,214995453,2017-11-27T00:00:00.000Z,"Apart from the reception (we were reprimanded for 15 minutes on not contacting her at every step of our journey - difficult when we do not have a network and do not know the city), the stay was well. The appartment is near to metro ( 3 minutes walk) and we had our own bathroom."
338470,37008615,2015-07-03T00:00:00.000Z,"I had a great stay at Gustaf's apartment. It is such a lovely bright, light, airy space. It's in a great area of Stockholm too. Gustaf was great about meeting me there, and taking me through a map highlighting places I might like to see. he is a lovely guy and made me feel very welcome.  His apartment building is one of a few surrounding a lovely little park too. Recommended place to stay."
1182616,77916024,2016-06-04T00:00:00.000Z,Peter was a great host. It was really easy to get from the airport and its well located.  You hace everything you need un hus house. The room was as described as the picture. Its a nice place to stay.

904739,45864739,2015-09-06T00:00:00.000Z,We just got back from a weekend in Stockolm.  Menaf's place is a great homebase that is close to everything.  Even getting though we landed at midnight we were still able to find the place without a problem thanks to Menaf's great directions.   The location is right in Soldermalm only about a 2-3min walk from the train station and about a 1-2 min walk from the nearest cycle station.    We would really recommend getting the 3 day pass for the city bikes and riding around the city.  Can't wait until we get back to Stockholm soon...definitely will try to stay at Menaf's again.

Details provided to the address was more than sufficient in navigating to the apartment. Apartment has a very cozy feeling and the room directly faces an open park with a good view of the outside and plenty of ventilation. Apartment is also located close to some of the neighbourhood's most beautiful viewing points of Stockholm up at Mariatorget. If you are intending to visit Stockholm and want somewhere nice and cozy to stay in Sodermalm, do consider staying with Lidia!"
164448,5158554,2013-06-16T00:00:00.000Z,"I only stayed two nights with Lidia, but she was a perfect host, kind and helpful.  Her room was very clean, with a comfortable bed, common room with sofa, books, magazines, kettle for tea, all you need to relax.  The shared bathroom was spotlessly clean, only a few steps away from the room, and included every possible convenience.  Her apartment is very conveniently located in a quiet, newer complex only a few blocks from the Stockholm Sodra train station.  She was very nice and extra helpful to me while I was there, and I would definitely recommend her place to anyone looking for a room in this area of Stockholm."

Her var lækkert og rent. Kommunikation med Gabriella var nem og ukompliceret. Ankomst og afgang var helt fleksibel, hvilket var et stort plus. Lejligheden ligger meget tæt til offentlig transport, indkøb af dagligvarer, restauranter, take-aways. Der er 1,5-2 km til centrum. Vi gik turen flere gange.

It is centrally located and really close to the Odenplan station which made getting around the city very convenient. The communication with Ann-Sofie was really easy and she went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed. She gave us information on the easiest way to get from the airport to the hotel and how much it should cost and she left us a packet of maps, and recommendations for restaurants when we arrived at the apartment. At the end of our stay, she even helped us book a taxi back to the airport. Really wonderful host!"

Parfait pour découvrir Stockholm ! Nous n'avons pas eu l'occasion de croiser notre hôte mais nos échanges étaient forts sympathiques.

I had already been travelling for 2 weeks and he was happy to arrange use of the laundry facilities during my check in.
He explained how to use everything clearly and even gifted me some laundry detergent to use.
I was worried about the bathroom facilities after reading some reviews but they were fine. 
The apartment was lovely and was everything I wanted for my 2 week stay.
The apartment is so close to everything, I know other reviews have said that but SERIOUSLY! 
Drottinggatan is one block over and everything is in walking distance, and I am not a fit person.
If I ever have the chance to return to Stockholm I would stay in Karls place again."
608672,98170648,2016-08-29T00:00:00.000Z,The studio is in a great location.  It was easy to get around the city using public transit.  There were food stores and restaurant nearby.  Karl is an excellent host and spent time telling about the studio and answering questions.  It quickly fixed an item that broke ... we told him about it in a morning email and it was fixed when we returned from a day of sightseeing.

Perfect location!
Couldn't have been better!
I would stay here again. I'd love to come back in the summer and enjoy the balcony.
Daniel is truly a sweet, honest and all-around great guy! He communicated promptly and clearly, and was very accommodating and flexible in dates.

All true about the location - this is truly in the heart of hip & trendy & busy & fun Götgatsbacken. 
We were so busy exploring the neighborhood - on foot - that we had no time to enjoy the big screen TV in the flat.
It was surprisingly quiet for a neighborhood with so many cafés, restaurants and bars.
We slept well, saved money and ate well by cooking in Daniel's well-equipped compact kitchen. The grocery store \"Matrebellerna\" just around the corner was well stocked. 
Free and fast wifi as well.
Thank you!"
