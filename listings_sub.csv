Since I'm only letting my apartment when I'm travelling I will not meet you in person, most often it is my good friend and colleagueJohan that will meet you.

In that way we can share a meal with new found friends - anywhere.

Home cooked food is one of our passions. While there, in our kitchen, we can circle the globe, at least once a week, and if on the road, a gas-fueld camping kitchen and our Indian spices will keep us going for months.

We tend to travel budget style, but never cheap. And we've discovered that hospitality never can be taken for granted, so we take part in chores if we are allowed. That could be anything from moving the lawn, do the laundry, paint a fence or any other household stuff.
You can say that we are kinda practical personalities by nature.

We seldom invest in guide-books but trust any locals to make sure we get introduced to their hidden treasures. We figure it's all about people and that it's supposedly easier to meet them if you aint buried your nose in a book.

I have also lived in London and in Madrid and when I did photography exhibits my work took me around the world. 
I currently work as a Political Advisor, my field of expertise is gender equality, as well as international affairs. I studied International Development Studies at UCLA. 
I live with my two children, a 10-year old boy and an 8-year old girl. (And our part-time fostercat that we are watching since her owner passed away. We say foster cat because sometimes the cat goes to stay with the children from her first family.) 
We lead a rather busy life, with full time work, the children go to an international school nearby, and we all take lots of classes ranging from Chinese, piano, cello, ballet, aikido, scouts, choir and yoga. We also tend to travel a lot - thus our trying out airbnb! This summer we will be traveling to Capri, Italy. In the fall we´re going to Shanghai, and for Christmas, Los Angeles.
My favorite movie is Frank Capra´s ""It´s a Wonderful Life"" and my favorite song is Louis Armstrong´s ""It´s a Wonderful World."" If I include the kids, our favorite movie would be ""Horton Hears a Who!"" and our favorite song might be something from Ella Fitzgerald that our neighbour plays on her old grammophone player outdoors. We all love Japanese food and chocolate cakes. I also love coffee ;-). When it comes to a life motto, I think mine is ""It always seems impossible - until it´s done!"" (Nelson Mandela).

We are a travel loving family of four who set up two airbnb guest rooms in our apartment so that we can meet people from all around the world. Our aim is to give our guests a possibility to see life in Sweden from the inside. Do not hesitate asking us for advice on what to see and do during your stay in Stockholm. Yoga studios and running trails, we know them all! When we are at home you are welcome to spend time with us if you like. If you want privacy and are just looking for a place to stay, that's of cause fine too.

The adults and 16 year old door daughter all speak swedish, english and german. Our 7 year old son mainly speaks swedish but is  learning both german and english.  

Our family loves traveling and we are becoming quite experienced airbnb-guests. When we are not at home working in Stockholm or travelling the world we love to spend our free time in our little summer cottage on an island an hour away from Stockholm. That means we sometimes spend the night away but we'll always be just one call or text message away for our guests, day and night!

Places i highly recommend in the nearest area is the restaurant Pappa Ray Ray, the Bistro Sud and the coffee shop Johan & Nyström, all at Swedenborgsgatan. There you also find several smaller, nice shops with clothes and organic foods. At St Paulsgatan you must stop for a coffee at ""Kaffe"" (as did Daniel Craig/Mikael Blomkvist in the Millenium movie ""The Girl Who Played with Fire""). You must also see the pottery of Mikaela Willers (Website hidden by Airbnb) At Mariatorget there is also the cosy Abba Hotel Rival, (Website hidden by Airbnb) where you can have a coffe or drink.

At the moment I have only made the days I know I will be away available, but I can probably accommodate guests other dates as well if special requests are made.

I am service minded and my guests are always very well taken care of. My home is my fortress and I take good care of it. I am extremely well organized and like things neat and tidy. Personality wise, I am very balanced, friendly, tolerant and easy to deal with regardless of the issue. 

I CANNOT live without my calendar... my iPhone... my Airbook... I am like most people today. Totally lost without them.

What my interests are and how I spend my time is nowhere near constant over time (I guess that is why it suits me so well working with change). At the present time I spend a lot of time socializing as well as relaxing and enjoying the city. I love the selection of restaurants, theaters, exhibits and so on in Stockholm. When it comes to eating. I love food and everything that enhances the experience of eating! Preparing it, eating it, getting the setting around the eating just right, finding the perfect place. Although I am the first to want to taste anything that is new the Italian cuisine is on top of my list, regardless of whether I am dining out or cooking myself. 

I enjoy long walks at Djurgarden as well as short walks in crowds streets with stops for eating, drinking and shopping. I also love traveling and NY is a city I love while the Caribbean offers the blue waters, white beaches and relaxation mode I also love. I love summer time boat trips in the archipelago. Sailing.... love that too but not on top of it just yet:-).

If you wish to go jogging there are many trails you can take from our house, either jog through Hammarby Sjöstad towards Hammarbybacken (the ski hill you see from our window), or why not run to the old prison island Långholmen where there is a very nice little beach for swimming.  There are several other bathing spots on Södermalm. Tantolunden, Årstaviken are two others we recommend. Stockholm has very clean water so you can actually swim in the middle of the city.  If you wish to go shopping instead, there are a lot of trendy stores within just 5 minutes walking distance. Our favourite restaurant in the neighbourhood is the japanese restaurant Blue Light Yokohama, where you need to book a table. We also recommend you visit the skybar ""Och himlen därtill"" which is on the top floor of Skrapan very close to Medborgarplatsen (T); they have amazing drinks here. If you are a ","From Arlanda, take the Arlanda express or the local commuter train to Stockholm C, at Stockholm C take bus 53 and get off at Ersta Sjukhus. If you take the local commuter train you may also get off at Stockholm södra and switch to bus 66; get off at Erstagatan if you do this. You can also park in the neighbourhood  if you can find a spot. From the apartment there's 100 m to bus 2 which is one of the four blue buses of Stockholm. The blue buses leaves around every third minute during daytime, and this bus will take you to Slussen, Old town, Stureplan etc. You have around 200 meters to bus 53 which will take you to the Central station and bus 71 that will take you to Slussen. If you walk down from the mountain (a seven minute walk but it's a beautiful panoramic walk among small cottages) you end up at Londonviadukten where you can access the buses to the islands east of Stockholm and here is also the ferry terminal to Finland.","Acess to dishwasher, induction hob, oven, microwave, refrigerator, freezer, mixer, coffee brewer and all our other cookware.

I really like the concept of Airbnb. I'm a very social, outgoing person, married to Magnus. I am an entrepreneur and I love to create new solutions to old problems. I enjoy meeting new people and hearing their stories, learning new things and seeing new places. I cannot live without nature; I love hiking, jogging, gardening, being in the wilderness... I used to be a DJ and my favorite genres are alternative rock, indie, synth, electro and anything retro. Love the sight of vinyl records. One of my favorite authors is John Steinbeck. Jim Jarmusch and Ingmar Bergman has made many great movies. So have the Coen brothers. I follow True Blood, Girls and MadMen. I seldom watch TV. I love smoothies and premium food which we cook from natural organic ingredients. My mission is to make guests feel that this was the best holiday in a long time. I want our home to be comfortable, tidy and visitor friendly. Why not read one of our books if you have a rainy / lazy day?

I have been travelling since I was a child and I just love Italy and especially Venice. Good food and good wine is a part of my life.
I also love adventure, but I take no risks. I suppose I can describe myself as a humble person with a great respect for other people. There are some luxuries that according to me are (sometimes) almost necessary, but I am actually quite happy with simple life - that is also my way to travel. I enjoy the company of nice people, but I feel totally OK alone. I am curious and keen on learning new things - in the very moment I am studying at the university, because I have to change my profession (engineer). I am humorous, honest, reliable and social. No matter my age, I have  a very young outlook on life. I speak English, German, Italian - and my ""northern"" languages Swedish and Finnish.

Travelling is one of my hobbies, as well as for instance litterature, good films, opera, classic music, outdoor life and biking. I have been travelling since I was a child and I just love Italy and especially Venice. Good food and good wine is a part of my life.
I also love adventure, but I take no risks. I suppose I can describe myself as a humble person with a great respect for other people. There are some luxuries that according to me are (sometimes) almost necessary, but I am actually quite happy with simple life - that is also my way to travel. I enjoy the company of nice people, but I feel totally OK alone. I am curious and keen on learning new things - in the very moment I am studying at the university, because I have to change my profession (engineer). I am humorous, honest, reliable and social. No matter my age, I have  a very young outlook on life. I speak English, German, Italian - and my ""northern"" languages Swedish and Finnish.

BUT, if you plan to cook a last meal, or hang out in the afternoon, please ask in advance. It might not suit my schedule that day.","There are two buses (2 minutes away) on the island that'll take you to Hornstull metro station or around the city. To walk to the metro station takes about 12 minutes, 15 if you have a lot of luggage.   If you take a taxi, only use Taxi Stockholm.","My guests will share the bathroom and the kitchen with me (and occasionally my daughter OR boyfriend). You will most likely be left alone in the apartment at least one night, especially on weekends. Also, on weekdays I leave as early as 6.20 and my daughter at about 8am, so there's a lot of privacy.  Please let me know in advance if you would like to use the kitchen to cook. It's much smoother that way, we can take turns :-). There's a great gas stove and an electric oven.  No heavy or greasy cooking, please.","I like talking to my guests, if I have the time. I work full-time as a teacher, so I can be a little tired. Please, no offence, I'm not a night-person. I go to bed at 9 pm on weeknights. However, I don't expect my guests to go to bed that early though :-). And I'm super quiet in the morning.","You cannot smoke inside. No pets because my daughter is very allergic to any animal.  I prefer not to receive guests after 10 pm, but once you have your own key, you can come and go as you want.  You cannot make a lot of noise after 10pm, my neighbours won't like it.

The Norr Mälarstrand waterfront is a lovely place for a walk, offering stunning views of the colourful façades that dot the Old Town and Södermalm.

It's packed during the summer with sunbathers, joggers and kids running around with ice cream. You can also find a grocery store, restaurants and coffee shops adjoining the boardwalk, and from there you'll see the trendy area Hornstull right across the water.

I'll sort you with details once you've booked. To get around town: There's a bus stop 1 min up the road from our building, taking you to Liljeholmen subway station in 5 min.

My name is Emil and I live in Stockholm together with my wife Sarah (who moved in from Berlin) and our newly arrived twin boys. 
We love unorganized and spontaneous travelling and always buy too expensive tickets just a few days in advanced. Another interest is spending time in nature and we know all about hiking in Scandinavia. 
People wonder if we shouldn’t move to a bigger place now when we are 4. We tried but it wasn't possible to leave this beautiful place.

////PLEASE NOTE: I only accept guests with multiple satisfying recommendations. And I have have a French bulldog puppy named Frank in the family too.///

I'm a life-loving entrepreneur in my mid-thirties who love to travel. 
Me and Frank live in a beautiful and tranquil apartment in the heart of Stockholm, at Mariatorget/Södermalm. 

Some of my best trips so far is Petra - for the epic walk before the old city reviled it self through the passage (Jordan), Kauai (Hawaii) for the extraordinary landscape, beautiful energy and green experience, Kraków - for the history (Poland), Anthony's Keys - for the most genuine dolphin experience so far (Honduras), Laguna Beach - for the memorable stay at host Korey's house with the marvelous view (California), Kawaguchico - for the breath taking close-up view over Mt Fuji (Japan). 

I love good food and tea. I prefer clean, pure and tasty food. I love the vast range of great restaurants, diners and Inn's in Stockholm, especially around Södermalm/Mariatorget, where I live. I have a gluten-free and refined sugar-free diet and don't eat that much meat.

I appreciate cleanness, and open non-messy spaces in a home.

Airbnb is a really nice way to meet new people, for renting out my apartment and also to find nice places to stay when traveling myself. I just love the concept and sometimes prefer to be staying in a home rather than in a hotel and to get a sense of being a citizen for a short while in the city/place Im visiting. 

I would be happy to see you, either during a trip or during your stay in my charming apartment.

I have hosted over a hundred guests so far, and I love it.  

I look forward in meeting you!

I'm into details and modest design (no minimalism really)...

ABOUT THE APARTMENT
What kind of home would you find yourself in at my place?
- ART, both old pieces and modern photography
- BALANCE, between romantic and design (rustic tables, neoclassical console table and mirror, industrial kitchen with brick wall and naked bulbs, design lamps and photography art, meters of old leather books)
- COMFORT, electrical appliances (dish machine, microwave, 46'' plasma, Home theater), Wi-Fi 100Mbits, indoor hammock, double bed (with top of the line duck down and satin)
- SPACE, separate bedroom, inflatable mattress available, small office with a workstation  
- LOCATION, about as central as it gets while not being in an office area (Kungsholmen)
- FRESH, it's been renovated completely Q4 2014

ABOUT ME

I try a lot of stuff! Albeit I'm getting pickier with age...

..playing beachvolleyboll at our local court or wherever I find myself traveling
..dancing pole or salsa

There is also a tram stop 2 mins walk away that in three stops can take you either to Liljeholmen (a metro/bus hub and mall to the west) or Gullmarsplan (metro/bus hub to the east) from where you can take the subway a few stops into the city.  There is night traffic every night of the week to a bus stop 5mins away from the house. From Skavsta the best option is to get to the city center by bus and then get here by subway/SL train/tram.,,,"We love animals but as one of us is very allergic we do not allow them to stay in the apartment.

Jag heter Siw men kallas för Siwa som även icke-svenskar kan säga utan problem, född o uppvuxen i Stockholm. Mitt hem är en unik charmig kulturmärkt tvåa på Mariaberget i Stockholm med tre mindre etage inne. Jag har egen vacker ingång direkt från kullerstenarna, mörkgrön/brun dubbel trädörr med två runda kajutafönster.

Förutom argentinsk tango är mina härliga två sondöttrar livets stora plus. Skidåkning utför, matlagning, cykla, bio, läsa, lösa knepiga korsord, resa etc. Nu höftopererad och time out från tango och skidåkning ett tag.

Jag sover i bäddsoffan utanför sovrummet. 
Om det känns obekvämt och mycket högre grad av integritet är viktig,  rekommenderar jag att boka ett större boende eller en lägenhet!

Mitt boende ligger på ett berg, alltså gående uppför från huvudgata, kommers och alla kommunikationer. Dessutom leder en trappa med 13 steg upp till min lilla gränd och min dörr. Inne i lägenheten leder fyra trappsteg ner till v-rum och angränsande uthyrningsrum. Till toalett och badrum är det sex trappsteg ner! 
OBS! Ej barn- eller handikappvänligt alltså!

Jag kommer att göra allt för att mina gäster ska ha det bekvämt och känna sig hemma och få bästa möjliga utbyte av sitt besök i min vackra stad.
Keep an open mind and live in the moment!

I am also producing films, writing books and feature for magazines.
I like to travel, both in my work and privately. My latest job journey was to Burma where I spent a month. I´va also done job journeys to countries like Kongo-Kinshasa, Burkina Faso and Kenya.
Summertime I never travel! – and  always spend in Smögen, an idyllic little island in the famous Swedish Westcoast Archipelago.  I love everything connected to the Sea – kayaking and sailing for example.
Wintertime I do longskating on the lakes, if possible – just as many stockholmers! And cross country skiing.
I´m a very social person who likes to do things together with friends, my grown-up children and nowadays grandchildren! I´m also active in NGO´s who fight xenophobia.
Persons who visit my home will notice the trace of my job journeys around the world. All these things reminds me of fantastic people I met!
Welcome!

Jag är journalist med fokus på livsåskådning, design och kultur. Jag producerar också filmer, skriver böcker och gör magasin.
Jag tycker om att resa, både i jobbet och privat. Har senast varit en månad i Burma/Myanmar och skriver nu om det. Gjort reportageresor i t ex Kongo-Kinshasa, Burkina Faso och Kenya.
Sommartid tillbringar jag alltid på Smögen, en idyllisk skärgårdsö på västkusten. Älskar allt som har med hav att göra. Paddlar gärna kajak och seglar. 
Vintertid åker jag gärna långfärdsskridskor – liksom väldigt många i Stockholm. Och skidor.
Är en aktiv person med vänner, barn och barnbarn – och engagerad i allt som motverkar främlingsfientlighet. 
Den som kommer hem till mig kommer se hur mina resor i världen satt sina spår i saker och ting. Och de påminner mig om fantastiska människor jag mött.
