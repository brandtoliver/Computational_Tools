The apartment itself is ideally located in trendy Södermalm, super close to bars, restaurants, and the historic center Gamla Stan. Kim herself is very nice and gave us great tips on what to do and where to eat."
11,145320,203410181,2017-10-15,23002655,Charlie,We absolutely loved Kim's place and had a great time exploring beautiful Stockholm. The apartment is roomy with a good taste of decorations. It's also centrally located with easy access to the subway and buses and only 20 min on foot to Gamla Stan/old town. Although we didn't get to meet Kim in person but she managed check-in and check-out super smooth and was so nice to leave the lights on for us as we arrived late in the evening. Thanks again for your hospitality again Kim!

Kim is very likeable and the flat is in a good location, very easy to arrive."
14,145320,212932349,2017-11-19,203826,Fe,"We had a wonderful time during our short stay at Kim's house. She made us feel very welcome and comfortable. The communication was easy at all times. She even bought us juice, coffee and bread so we had breakfast next morning (after arriving late at night at her apartment)! We totally recommend her place. Thank you, Kim!"
15,145320,214018139,2017-11-24,70756436,Marcel,"Great location! Cozy place, amazing inside infos and hospitality! Thx u kim!"
16,145320,216533345,2017-12-04,10655526,Shannon,"Lovely flat in a great part of town - lots of coffee shops, boutiques and bars. We didn't get a chance to meet Kim, but she made our stay very easy ! Thanks Kim "
17,145320,219021131,2017-12-16,29246547,Dan,"Kim’s flat is in a wonderful place in Stockholm, in an area just south of Old Town. The neighborhood is so close to everything you’d want (museums, shopping, food), but it’s also so quiet, so safe, and so clean. Kim herself is a very friendly and impressive woman, and was a warm and thoughtful host. When we come back to Stockholm, we’ll definitely hope to stay here again!"
18,145320,231273225,2018-01-31,160717975,Sam,"I would definitely recommend Kim's place for anyone wanting to stay near the city in a nice comfortable place. Close to the subway, 3 stops from the Central station, close to shopping markets. Kim provided good instructions and was very quick to respond to emails. She also gave some recommendations of things to do in the area, can't comment on that however as I was too busy to actually check them out.

What to expect: Very cosy interior, had a warm feeling that you can't get just anywhere. Didn't feel like I was staying in an AirBNB, felt like being in a home."
19,145320,233159940,2018-02-08,33212603,Katina,"Kim's place is perfectly located and very comfortable. She was away during my 5-day stay, but was always very responsive in answering questions and providing advice."
20,145320,234271335,2018-02-12,160422715,Kensuke,The flat is so comfortable and Swedish style. This is a 2 minutes walk from nearest station. It is so easy to live because the design of the room makes me feel relaxed. I wanna stay there again if I visit in Stockholm.
21,145320,238617249,2018-02-26,171567489,Nilgun,"It was great time at Kims place, friendly and warmest welcome, and great location."

23,145320,244964347,2018-03-20,16469934,Eugenio,"Kim is a wonderful host and a lovely person. We could not have asked for a better host. Her recommendations were excellent and she was always quick to respond and made sure we felt right at home. The apartment has everything you might need for your stay. It is located within walking distance to public transportation, restaurants, bars, yet somehow feels a little secluded, which is great. Would definitely recommend staying here."
24,145320,250191884,2018-04-04,113793451,Jesse,"What an incredibly great location with even better hospitality, could not have asked for a better place."
25,145320,255613837,2018-04-21,11689674,Sebastian,"We stayed one week in Stockholm. Kim was a great host and we had a great time staying at her apartment. The private room was small, but we could use the complete apartment and often relaxed on the nice chairs in the living room. Kim's kitchen has everything you need to cook meals and we had our own space in the fridge.
The location of the apartment is indeed very central. It was a perfect starting point to explore the city walking or by public transport. Restaurants, bars, and parks can be reached within a few minutes of walking distance."
26,145320,262324560,2018-05-08,24114569,Aymeric,"Notre séjour chez Kim était parfait, de l’accueil à l'arrivée jusqu'au départ, l'appartement est bien placé dans la quartier à la mode de Stockholm. L'appartement est propre, la chambre confortable et tout est fait pour que l'on se sente à l'aise. En résumé c'est un endroit parfait pour passer un weekend à Stockholm réussi."
27,145320,263616667,2018-05-12,178111737,Brian,"The place was great, close to shops and the metro. Kim was a great host and we had a great time. There was a lot to good and everything was really close by."
28,145320,266040511,2018-05-19,86001838,Jinju,"Best host, best house, recommended here! Thank you kim!"
29,145320,267677547,2018-05-22,97955787,Tammy,"A great host! The place is close to the city centre with easy access and a safe area. Kim is organised and quick at responding, also gave great tips about local places."
30,145320,268473313,2018-05-25,177556525,Brittany,The host canceled this reservation 70 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
31,145320,268908833,2018-05-26,99271530,Kali,"Kim's home is very close to Stockholm, and it was a great place for us to stay in order to quickly reach the city on foot (about 20 min). Our check-in was a bit rough as she forgot to send us the directions to her home, but I believe that we were a special case and that this does not usually happen. The beds were quite comfortable; however, it gets a bit cold at night because the windows and doors in the home are always open. Kim allows guests to use the entire house which is very nice, and her kitchen is the cutest area. Kim is also very kind and friendly. Overall, we enjoyed our experience there and would recommend staying here for a short trip!"
32,145320,269848901,2018-05-28,66517089,Amit,"Kim has a wonderfully funky space in the heart of Södermalm!  I found her location knowledge and recommendations to be invaluable.  Kim's apartment is quiet and cozy, and I loved the small terrace with hammock."
33,145320,271098522,2018-05-31,96009807,Lucy,"Kim's place is in a great location with lots of fun shopping and restaurants around. The place was very cute and comfortable with a lived in but tidy vibe. We didn't meet Kim until our second day but she was very helpful in checkin and in offering tips about Stockholm! Finally, she was very accommodating in letting us stay an extra hour and a half when our other Airbnb pushed back the check in time. Great place to stay if you want to see a different side of Stockholm but still have access to the more touristy areas!"
34,145320,273792504,2018-06-07,1737373,Michaela,"The main advantage of Kim's home is the excellent location. It's in hip and trendy Södermalm, but in a quiet street, so you'll get a good night's sleep. Also Petrus bakery, which makes the most delicious cinnamon buns, is right around the corner. Kim was - once she was home -  a very good host full of helpful tips and information. As it says elsewhere in the comments, the flat is lovingly decorated and exudes the air of a place well-loved and lived-in. However, if you want fancy and stylish accommodation this is not it. It's perfectly serviceable for a few days though and we'd still recommend it."
35,145320,274916598,2018-06-10,55134076,Aurélie,"Nous avons passé un super séjour chez Kim. Nous n’avons pas eu l’occasion de la rencontrer mais elle s’est montrée très réactive et hyper arrangeante dans nos échanges. 
L’appartement est très propre et très bien situé dans un quartier qui bouge beaucoup, à seulement 4 min du métro. 
Nous avons eu la chance de pouvoir admirer le soleil de
Minuit depuis la chambre de l’appartement... ça vaut le coup !
Je recommande a 100%"
36,145320,278477794,2018-06-18,26011088,Maria,"We had a really lovely stay at Kim's place and made the most of being in trendy Södermalm! Really lovely places to eat or sip a coffee and cool secondhand shops. I slept really well which is a good sign I guess. It felt like a home and it is a peaceful place. Would recommend to stay and I would come back any time. 
If you are in Sweden for the first time, the shower, stove and windows do work differently. My tip is to check those things on arrival and you are all set. Communication with Kim went well, organizing check in and check out was easy too."
37,145320,288159998,2018-07-09,95177961,Ted,"Trivdes bra, nära till det mesta, rent och prydligt. Kim kommunicerade mycket bra och korrekt!"
38,145320,289819498,2018-07-13,4944617,Rachit,"My stay at Kim's place was wonderful! Her house is so cute, charming, and beautiful. To add to that, the location is perfect with great cafes and restaurants right around the corner.  Kim was also an extremely accomodating host who gave me great tips and even let me use the washer before my hiking trip - much appreciated! :)"
39,145320,290896600,2018-07-15,46367807,Adelaide Santos,"Apartment with a wonderful location. Kim responded quickly (she was not there during our stay) to our questions and had useful tips for us. Indeed; in the middle of it all :-) 

Söder is the place to stay! :-)"
40,145320,310825120,2018-08-20,52414264,Mathilde,"Vous pouvez aller chez Kim les yeux fermés. C'est une hôtesse d'exception, accueillante, chaleureuse et bienveillante, elle m'a tout de suite aidée à me sentir comme chez moi dans son adorable appartement - au passage idéalement situé. Ses conseils vous aideront à passer un incroyable séjour à Stockholm ! Encore merci Kim ! "
41,145320,315286870,2018-08-28,72732381,Léna,"If you visit Stockholm and want a perfect room at a perfect location: don’t hesitate. Kim’s apartment is gorgeous, close to every interesting part of the town. 
She is lovely and will give you great local tips.

45,145320,325592745,2018-09-20,29067866,Erin,Kim’s place is perfect size for two guests. The location is walking distance to a major public transit station as well as several bus stops as well depending on which direction you wish to go. The bed is comfortable and clean. Kim greeted us and made us feel very welcome. I’d have no issues with staying here again
46,145320,329649490,2018-09-29,34389286,Jenna,"Kim was a wonderful host, she was great about answering questions and directing us around the city in the most convenient and affordable ways possible. Her place is very cute and artsy and within walking distance of some great pubs and cafes as well as the Old Town. We would definitely stay here again!"

Would definitely stay here again!"
52,145320,343687167,2018-11-01,62458814,David,"Kim is a wonderful host, and welcomes you into her home.  It is also very central to whatever you might want to do in Stockholm.  We really enjoyed our stay!"

62,145320,410552409,2019-02-10,189303825,Carla,Als je bij Kim verblijft heb je een prima appartement om Stockholm te ontdekken. Dichtbij de metro en het oude centrum. Kim is erg gastvrij. Wij kwamen pas na middernacht aan en ze heeft gewoon op ons gewacht. Je krijgt een kamer in haar flat op de 6e verdieping. Je bent vrij om alles te gebruiken.
63,145320,414330106,2019-02-19,219893670,Alexander,"We had a wonderful stay in Kim's very centrally located apartment.
Kim was very helpful from the start: Coming with good tips on how to get from the airport to her apartment in the cheapest and fastest way - and furthermore giving us local tips. 
The apartment is clean, nice, with a good kitchen and a very comfortable bed! 
While Stockholm is an expensive city - both for hotels and AirB'n'B - Kim's apartment proved to be of good value. 
We can only recommend other people to stay at Kim's place and be greeted by her hospitality."
64,145320,417736211,2019-02-28,2635046,Cécile,Kim est une hôtesse très sympathique et vraiment serviable ! La chambre est petite mais cosy et super bien située ! Je recommande!
65,145320,423869171,2019-03-15,236557225,Kateryna,"Kim is the best hostess ever imagined! We had a great stay at her lovely place, where you could feel the atmosphere of Swedish lagom. Flat has a great location, which makes it even better. Kim was really helpful, having suggested a lot of useful tips. She was really hospitable, we had everything we needed. I wish we didn't have to leave!

Thank you, Kim!"

69,145320,452849736,2019-05-14,42438152,Dora,"Kim's place is great! The location is very central but close to all the interesting sites. It is not the main touristy area which is by all means a huge plus. All of the restaurants, coffee shops, and bakeries right down the street were amazing. The amenities were very good. Overall we really enjoyed it."
70,145320,462664737,2019-06-02,19312174,Lone,"Vi havde 4 nætter i Kims lejlighed, som er hyggelig, velfungerende, uhøjtidelig og charmerende.
Lejligheden ligger centralt i byen, med gode indkøbsmuligheder, cafeer og restauranter og i gå afstand til mange seværdigheder."
71,145320,468682315,2019-06-13,6233598,Joe M.,"Kim's apartment was a great hub for my son and me while we visited Stockholm. The apartment is as pictured, with a nice window opening over the street. There is a shared bathroom adjacent to the guest room where you sleep. You have access to wifi, kitchen, and the elevator is a wonderful bonus because you're up several floors!

I did not see a way to lock the guest room or the bathroom, and those are the only small things I might suggest. Certainly no criticism of the host; it's just that a lock can give the traveler some additional peace of mind. It was, to be fair, not a problem at all while we were there. So I may be overthinking this.

The neighborhood is spectacular, with many food choices nearby and convenient access to mass transit. To save money, I advise travelers to take the Pendeltåg commuter train (line 40 or 43) from the airport down to Södra station. Much less expensive than taxi or Arlanda Express, and the 45-minute train ride is comfortable.

I did not meet Kim, but Kim's daughter Irma was a wonderful host and so kind to us as we arrived and got settled. I hope to visit Stockholm again and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here in the future."
72,145320,476029472,2019-06-25,29139,John & Claire,"We spent a lovely couple of nights at Kim’s apartment and found it to be very convenient, clean and comfortable. It was within walking distance to shops and transport which was great. Thanks for a great stay Kim!"

74,155685,830804,2012-01-03,827612,Philippe,"We spent one week in Stockholm and the flat of Robert is awesome. Nice view on the river, 2 minutes from many restaurants in the area, 2 minutes from the train station and few stops from the center. Robert is by the way a nice, kind amazing host. Eerything is prepared to have good time there. and of course we will recommand Robert for everyone going to Stockholm ! "

Robert is a formidable host and was extremely attentive to details, from the first communication to his friendly greeting upon our arrival.  The apartment was spotless, tastefully decorated and comfortable, exactly as per the listing, and Robert had provided us with everything we could possibly require.  The neighbourhood is vibrant and full of life (especially on the weekends), and a great location from which to explore Stockholm (either on foot or by subway, with a station within 2 minutes).  Highly recommended!"
81,155685,3249321,2013-01-03,3896878,Friederike,"Really great apartment, just as nice as on the pictures. Sportless & clean, just a really good atmophere and also in a really cool neighborhood. We had 5 great days in Stockholm. Robert is a great host,  very welcoming, easy to communicate with and also very helpful with tips for the city and instructions for the transportation. Everything worked out just fine  - I can highly recommend the apartment & Robert as a host! "

Robert is very nice and friendly person, you may consider his apartment if you are looking one!"
83,155685,25034290,2015-01-05,2853633,Diego,"Robert was a fantastic host: kind, easy going and we felt he really put an effort on us feeling at home: We arrived on New Year's Eve and he waited patiently for us and even bought us breakfast for the next morning.

His place is really beautiful: amazing views, wonderful light and its decorated with a lot of taste. We loved the location and everything we need was walking distance (grocery shops, restaurants, bakeries, ..). 

If we come back to Stockholm I hope we could stay there again."
84,155685,30219020,2015-04-19,1699922,Zach,"Roberts place was even better than pictures described. Great location to bus and metro!! Fantastic views from his windows. Design aesthetic was very trendy as well. He was also very helpful with food suggestions. Hornstull is full of cafes, restaurants, and chic shops. There's even an underground grocery store / shopping mall really close. We'd stay here again without hesitation."

Thank u so much Robert!"
87,155685,34540122,2015-06-09,14048905,Murray,Robert's apartment in Hornstull is in a perfect location to be able to walk around the centre of the city. The view from the apartment was incredible and the apartment itself gorgeously decorated. The apartment had everything we needed to be able to cook when we wanted. A fantastic stay all round! 
88,155685,36038417,2015-06-24,908076,Berk,"We had a great stay at Robert's place. Though he couldn't be there to meet us (We'd arrived in the middle of the night), he made sure we had a smooth check-in and that everything was in order. All in all, he was a perfect host.

The location is great. The neighbourhood is lively and the apartment is close to the Hornstull T-Bana station and the bus stop where you can take the airport bus.

The apartment itself is decorated both aesthetically and functionally. We felt quite at home. I'd definitely recommend this place."

We really enjoyed our stay."

From the moment I arrived, I could feel very comfortable and as I listen music alot, the sound system was terrific for me. Robert's house view is stunning which I can say one of top views during my travel. the transport is also very close and other supermarkets and parks as well. I would like to stay here next summer again."
91,155685,44022648,2015-08-23,22929062,Ricky,Thanks for the apartment!  Nice location and very easy to get to from the airport and downtown.
92,155685,45997208,2015-09-07,16556399,Håvard,"The flat was nice and tidy, and the area was a cozy one with lots of cafes and places to visit. Robert was a friendly guy, and the books were interesting.

Two things that can be improved/informed about:

The curtains are very light, and for someone it can be difficult falling asleep, and there is a highway with continous traffic, if you're not used to it, it can be disturbing, so would be advisable to bring earplugs and a sleeping mask."
93,155685,51804412,2015-10-24,45269872,Otto,"We enjoyed a fabulous 5 day stay in Stockholm. What a beautiful stately and trendy city! Robert's apartment was cozy, warmly decorated and comfortable. Everything felt good. The kitchen was complete and everything was fine clean. Although Robert was abroad, we had good contact and efficient and service oriented. This was our first experience Airbnb; a fantastic experience."

The bed is a large king size and the room very quiet.  We slept wonderfuly well... however, the best part is Lidia herself.  She is kind, helpful, and had a wonderful breakfast for us each day as well as guides of the city and advice on what to see with the time we had allowed. 
If I were ever to go back to Stockholm, I would not consider staying elsewhere!"

Hemos estado muy a gusto en su casa.

Even though there were several people staying in other rooms at her apartment at the time we were staying, it was absolutely fine and we didn't feel any inconvenience at all. 
I highly recommend staying at Lidia's place. It is great value and experience for staying at the center of Stockholm. "

The breakfast is very good, full of international and tipical swedish food.
The house is in a good  place: one J-stop to the city and in the right side to enjoy the nightlife of Stoccolma's Soderlmam and be tranquil during the sleep.I recommend her rooms as a good location for visiting Stockholm."

Each morning we were treated to a full European breakfast and sent off to sight-see Stockholm with full tummies. Lidia knows the city of Stockholm and was willing to share her knowledge of the city with us to give us the best ideas on what to see and when to see it so that we could fit everything in that we wanted to see before we were to leave Stockholm to continue our tour.  Thank you Lidia!

120,164448,5158554,2013-06-16,1493472,Chuck,"I only stayed two nights with Lidia, but she was a perfect host, kind and helpful.  Her room was very clean, with a comfortable bed, common room with sofa, books, magazines, kettle for tea, all you need to relax.  The shared bathroom was spotlessly clean, only a few steps away from the room, and included every possible convenience.  Her apartment is very conveniently located in a quiet, newer complex only a few blocks from the Stockholm Sodra train station.  She was very nice and extra helpful to me while I was there, and I would definitely recommend her place to anyone looking for a room in this area of Stockholm."
121,164448,5230802,2013-06-19,6315188,Anna,Lidia is very friendly and helpful. Her place is fantastically located and reasonably priced. I happily recommend staying with Lidia to anyone visiting Stockholm.

Toujours de bonne humeur, elle aime discuter et veille à ce que ses invités se sentent bien. 
Le quartier de Södermalm est vraiment super : très joli, très animé, avec beaucoup de magasins, restaurants et bars sympathiques à moins de 10 minutes à pied. C'est le quartier de Stockholm que nous avons préféré.
Précisons que trois chambres sont louées à l'étage, et que l'ambiance de l'appartement dépend aussi beaucoup des autres occupants."

You feel very welcome and so I can totally definitely recommend it!"
137,164448,8663866,2013-11-11,9470305,Katie,"I stayed at Lidia's with my boyfriend this weekend and we had a great time. The flat is in a very good location - walking distance from the trendy SoFo and from Gamla Stan and also very close to Sodra station which is one stop from Central Station (on the commute train). The room was quite basic but perfectly nice with a proper bed (very comfy!) and there is a sitting area outside with a fridge, microwave and kettle. Lidia was very kind and helpful with all sorts of maps and tourist guides for us to borrow and loads of advice.

140,164448,13780819,2014-06-04,7735454,Iris,"Lidia was perfect. She is a smart, active woman who always tried to do the best for us. When we were in Stockholm there were some works on the public transports and Lidia helped us a lot figuering out the best way to get where we needed to and gave us good suggestions to what to see in her city. The house is big, always clean and we had enough room for ourselves."
141,164448,13938309,2014-06-08,13461507,Sherry,"We stayed three nights here and she couldn't be more helpful. As soon as we got there she showed us how to get around and where to visit. Her place is very conveniently located to the metro station and walking distance to a market and many restaurants. Very clean and privacy was not an issue at all despite other guests staying as well. Wifi was not that reliable, but you're on vacation so it doesn't really matter :)"

She is very very helpful and helps you organising your stay. She can tell you about sweden and its capital. Me and my friend would always come back to her flat! The location of the appartment is especially for young people very interesting. The bohemean and student area are very close by. The room is not too big but there is enough space for a few days. There is a good security in the house and an elevator. The bathroom is not the youngest but very clean. She offers breakfast if you want to. Just enjoy the stay in her accomodation and the city! Thank you Lidia.
145,164448,19282806,2014-09-09,3202932,Autumn,"Our stay with Lidia was absolutely fantastic!  The accommodations were very comfortable and inviting.  We shared a bathroom and sitting room with other guests which worked out very smoothly, no problems, and it was nice to meet and socialize with the other guests.  Lidia's home is in the perfect location to visit Stockholm, everything is VERY easily accessible.  However, the MOST wonderful part of our stay was our host, Lidia.  She was so inviting, helpful, warm, and welcoming.  When we first arrived she had us for tea/coffee and gave us an overview of the city and places to go and see and do!  She answered all our questions throughout the stay and could not have been more helpful.  In addition, my boyfriend was having sinus problems from all the plane travel and Lidia was so kind and generous to provide some medications/remedies to help him feel better.  We 100% recommend staying with Lidia, she is a genuinely sweet, knowledgeable, thoughtful, accommodating and kind woman and host.   Thank you Lidia for everything, we wish you the very best."

From Stockholm Arlanda Airport take the PENDELAG train toward ALVJSO station (125 sek/pers) , 11 stops, 43 minutes, step down at SODRA station and ...follow the Lidia's indications: after 10 minutes (walk) we meet Lidia in the apartment.
Our departure was from Stockholm Central Station: walk 5 minutes from Lidia to SODRA station (another traject, ask Lidia), take the train to Stockholm Central station, step down to first stop.
Walking distances to down town and many cultural and historical attractions."

I stayed with Lidia while working for a week in nearby Nacka. I had a very nice stay. Lidia is a lovely person, very kind and helpfull. When I arrived she helped me with my stuff and gave me a map showing me everything I needed to know about the area and how to get to work via public transport next day. 
Lidias home is very nice and clean just as you will see in the pictures. I liked the way she has a microwave, fridge and tea making facilities for guests which makes more comfortable for longer stays.
The apt is minutes walk to transport links only couple of stops to Central station. Sodra station is only 30 second walk and from there you can get a direct train to and from Arlanda.
Although I was working a lot is was good that lidia's place in Sodermalm is only 5 minute walk from  medborgarplatsen which is great for going out with loads of nice bars and restaurants. 
When I return to stockholm I will definately be staying with Lidia."

There was a shared living space upstairs right outside our room where Lidia left tea making facilities etc. Location wide this is fantastic. Loads of public transport options extremely close by. Lots of places to eat, drink or look at some shops. And it was a very simple and short walk to the old town (about 20min I think) and then into the downtown area. Lidia was so helpful! When we arrived VERY late from the airport she stayed up to meet us and took the time to sit down with us, make a pot of tea, and discuss all the things we wanted to do while visiting. She gave us a map and helped us to know where everything was. Throughout our stay she was always helpful with ideas and even researched a lovely restaurant for us for brunch on Sunday!
It is worth noting that Lidia has two rooms that she rents out and these rooms share the one bathroom and the living space. Lidia bases herself downstairs. This wasn't an issue for us at all."

Responses were very prompt from pre-booking (2mths plus in advance) to even 1 day before my arrival. Directions were given clearly. You do need to drag your stuff from Sodra station for around 5mins so do take note of that.

Upon check in, Lidia was present, she welcomed us like we are some long lost families. From the info she provided, I could have mistaken her for her pro advice on the sights to cover in Stockholms / admission fee prices to some and even which part of the train to stand in order to alight nearer to Saluhall at Ostermalm station (it's in front). Her attention to details and willingness to socialize with us provided a warm welcome to us. Room is good, coffee and tea was provided and toilet is super clean.

Thanks Lidia for your hospitality!"

Si tratta di un B&B bello, abbastanza curato e funzionale. La camera è fornita di tutti i confort necessari per mettere gli ospiti a proprio agio e a renderli pienamente autonomi. E’ collocato in una posizione strategica col il valore aggiunto che la proprietaria Lidia è una persona molto disponibile, gentile e di ottima compagnia. Lidia ci ha dato tanti consigli su come muoversi a Stoccolma. La posizione è ottima, a pochi passi dalla stazione di Sodra che permette di arrivare ovunque.
Lo consigliamo e ci ritorneremo sicuramente.

217,164448,80173958,2016-06-16,43610883,Anna,"Very nice neighborhood and apartment exactly as described! Perfect for a few days stay. Lidia was incredibly friendly and provided guides and maps for us, pointing out good areas to go to in the city. There was a microwave, mini fridge, and dishes upstairs in the living area which was perfect for when we made breakfast and had a few groceries to store. The apartment is in a great location in Sodermalm and do-able walking distance from everything in Stockholm! Would love staying with Lidia again if I get to visit Stockholm in the future. "

221,164448,82712107,2016-06-29,74941359,Junqin,"Really enjoy to live in Lydia's place quite near to the train. Clean and conveinent. Lydia gave us a map and made coffee for us when we arrived, she knows a lot about the city and told us some must-go scenes. The  breakfast she make is delicious recommend that. Highly recommended her place to live in truly worth it. We have good time there."
222,164448,83046934,2016-07-01,34880611,Thu Hang,Lidia is very friendly and helpful. She provided my friend and myself great advice on places to go while being in Stockholm. We enjoyed staying at her house and would recommend her place to others.

The bed was very comfortable and the room was a good size for my husband and I to share. The location was amazing and very walkable. If my husband and I go back to Stockholm we would stay here again. 
224,164448,84708058,2016-07-08,63002406,Teni,The space was very clean and very comfortable! The location right beside the train station was incredible for getting around the city.  Lidia was one of the best hosts I've ever had through Airbnb - she was so helpful and informative and help our stay be even better than it would have been.  She had great tips for sight seeing and maps to help us get around.  Definitely would recommend her as a host as well as recommend the great space she had listed.

227,164448,90299474,2016-07-31,8788386,Marina,"Lidia´s accomodation was simply perfect. The house is clean and located in a good place, really quiet at night but at the same time close to the old town. Lidia was the best host ever: she was very flexible with the times of arriving and leaving, she gave us plenty of information on how to reach her house in the most convenient way and also about what to do and see around Stockholm, but at the same time she wasn´t intrusive at all. She is one of the kindest lady I have ever met, I really hope to come back one day!"
228,164448,91063817,2016-08-03,42435202,Wilson,The neighborhood was a perfect jumping ground to visit the city but in a lovely quiet neighborhood meaning noise was not an issue.  Lidia greeted me on my arrival and provided lots of background info and suggestions of places to visit.  The double room has 2 single beds that can be pushed together for couples or separated for 2 friends sharing.  The communal area has fridge and kettle etc so you can get a takeout or breakfast/lunch items and have a place to put these in order to keep your costs down.  Metro is just around the corner so it was no problems getting around with luggage.

Once settled, Lidia gave us a nice overview of things to do in Stockholm which was very useful.  The location of the appartement is perfect, right next to a train station and walking distance of Götgatan where you can find everything you need.  We had a great time, we would definitively go back to Lidia's place."
230,164448,92751268,2016-08-09,55712680,Brenda,Lovely! She knew a lot about the area and the public transportation. The room was very nice. 
231,164448,93140407,2016-08-11,12370460,Addie,"Lidia was super sweet! She sat down and explained everything I needed to know about Stockholm when I arrived and was very accommodating during our stay. There were no blackout curtains in the room, but there were eye masks and a beautiful window overlooking a big (and busy) playground and courtyard. We loved staying in the less touristy Sodermalm, south of the main part of the city but still close to public transportation, shops, cafes and restaurants."
232,164448,94293426,2016-08-15,32884084,Rebecca,The apartment was very easy to find and in a great location. It was close to transport and lots of great cafes. Great spot!

할머니께서 정말 친절하게 처음부터 끝까지 잘 챙겨주셨습니다.
숙소 위치도 기차역, 그리고 시내 나가는 버스타는 곳과도 가까워 편하게 다녔구요.
숙소 또한 쾌적하고 깨끗하고 (여기에 표시는 안되어있지만) 냉장고, 전자레인지도 있어요.
스톡홀름의 아름다운 기억과 함께 할머니도 잊지 못할거예요.
다시 또 방문하고 싶어요!"

235,164448,98382434,2016-08-30,53745099,Cooper,"Lidia was a fantastic host and very knowledgeable about Stockholm. She was almost always around on the first level of the apartment and always willing to help. We would recommend her to anyone!

The rooms are on the second level in the apartment, among a few others rooms with a shared living space and bathroom. Everything was clean and comfortable.

Easy access to trains and buses from the apartment. Sodermalm is an interesting area and relatively close to Gamla Stan, within a mile, and most other attractions."

Lidia hat uns genaue Informationen gegeben wie wir vom Flughafen Arlanda  am günstigsten zu ihrem Appartement kommen, war sehr hilfreich. Das Appartement liegt um die Ecke der Zug bzw. Metrostation, was auch sehr angenehm ist, außerdem ist auch die Bushaltestellt in der Nähe. Das Appartement liegt in einem guten, ruhigen Viertel. Es ist gut ausgestattet mit gemeinsamen Aufenthaltsraum in dem es an nichts fehlt. Wir wurden sehr freundlich von Lidia mit einer Tasse Kaffee und Tee empfangen und Lidia nahm sich Zeit, um uns auf dem Stadtplan die Sehenswürdigkeiten zu zeigen, war echt super. Sehr zu empfehlen. Silke und Janina"
238,164448,101932070,2016-09-16,1865767,Maggie,"Lidia's place was very comfortable and homey. There was a lot of privacy, as we were on the second floor and had access to a separate bathroom as well as numerous other helpful amenities. The first day we were there, Lidia voluntarily gave us a 20 - minute review of Stockholm's highlights, attractions, and activities. She was available whenever we needed help, always with a smile and ready laugh. We had our own key, which was useful. The place is near a school, so in the mornings, we heard children laughing from the nearby school :) A great stay with a warm host!"
239,164448,102874913,2016-09-19,78464156,Mathieu,"Le séjour a été très agréable. L'appartement est spacieux, très joli, propre et surtout très calme. Lidia est une personne très sympathique. Elle donne plein de bons conseils afin de réussir au mieux le séjour. Rien ne manquait dans l'appartement. La chambre est grande avec des livres, tv,... Tout pour être comme chez soi.

242,164448,104832477,2016-09-28,64724044,Angus,"Everything as described,  Lidia buzzed us into the building and after showing us to our room kindly sat us down with a cup of tea and showed us on a map some of the highlights of Stockholm. We slept well and enjoyed our stay. The underground system was less than 10 mins walk away."
243,164448,105266034,2016-10-01,21252472,Peifeng,"Lidia is very nice,she was waiting us in the outside door when we arrived, then show me the map and told me about the transportation, sight viewing detailedly, the room is exactly same with the discreption, it is nice, just like home ,very convenient to ervey where, the ICA supermarket is near the apartment .

La stanza non è molto grande ma il letto è matrimoniale ed i materassi comodi. Il bagno è vicino alla stanza ed abbiamo usufruito anche del comodo forno a microonde che era nel soggiorno adiacente.
L'appartamento è situato nel quartiere Soderlmalm, ricco di ristoranti, supermarket, pub e negozi. 
Distante 15 minuti a piedi dalle Metro: Mariatorget o Medborgarplatsen con le quali si arriva in Gamla Stan con due fermate."

The facility is clean and we feel like at home. Our room is located upstair while the host live down stair. We have all the privacy as the host does not come up stair at all. She does come up to tidy/clean the place while we were out. Lidia allowed us to check out late which has been very useful as our departure from Stockholm is at 2:00 pm. The place is centrally located. Stockholm old town, major shopping areas, City Hall etc. are all within walking distance. Only one stop from the central train station. We thoroughly recommend this place to other travellers. "

The house is really near from public transport if you arrive Stockholm from Arlanda airport. It is very warm, relaxing and quiet. We spent four intense days walking around Stockholm and Lidia's house offered us the rest we needed every night. And she is so kind every moment! She offered us tea and coffee just after the arrival and spent time explaining us all kinds of tips regarding Stockholm. It remains clear she loves her home city and she loves to communicate it to visitors. The room has space enough, the beds are big, the views are nice... The neighbourhood is as quiet as cool. Really hipster area in Södermalm called SoFo. If we return to Stockholm Lidia's home will be our choice!"
253,164448,120269354,2016-12-09,9658397,A,"Lidia is communicative and kind. She's attentive when she needs to be but knows when to give guests space. The place is as described and is clean, cozy, and quiet. 

I would recommend this room to anyone who is seeking an affordable and centrally located option. If you like to walk - this location is just close enough to some of the major sites (about 20 min in multiple directions). Public transportation is also very close by (4 min walk) "

Lidia is absolutely lovely, very welcoming, helpful and smiling! She waited for us until late in the night and she carefully explained everything about the main spots of the city and trasports so that we would be ready and well prepared the next day (she gave us also maps and brochures).
She lives in the same apartment but in a separate part of the house so you will have your own privacy. The bathroom is shared with other two rooms but there was never the need to queue.
Our room (good size for two people) and the whole house was clean, warm and cosy. Even though the breakfast was not included, coffee and tea were always there for us, kindly offered by the host. 
There is a fridge, microwave, kettle, cutlery and plates to warm up or store your own food, as well as a common room where to eat. There is wifi.
The location of the house is very good:
- nice and quiet area
- 2 minutes walking from the train station (black line J) which connects directly to Stockholm Central  in around 5 minutes where you can catch the metro with the same ticket. Trains pass very often...we have never waited more than 10-15 minutes 
- 700 metres from the nearest metro station (in case you don't want to change from metro to trains)
- 2 minutes walking from the nearest supermarket 
- 25 minutes walking from the old town"

Her house is close to metro (T-bana) and bus stops, with almost everything you need. If you don't have detail plans for Stockholm, you can count on her. She has collected a lot of maps and information for touring.

Lidia是一个相当有意思的退休老太太, 和她聊天很有意思, 能够了解到当地人这几十年来的生活状态. 中国游客可以放心选择她的这个公寓: 干净, 整洁, 漂亮, 以及热心的主人. 离地铁和车站都很近."

De kamer en de voorzieningen zijn prima, niet erg modern maar wel een goed (zacht) bed , een koelkast en waterkoker en een lekkere douche.

Unser Zimmer war mit einem bequemen Doppelbett ausgestattet und im Vorraum standen Kühlschrank, Mikrowelle und Wasserkocher bereit, dazu eine kleine Auswahl an Tee und Kaffee. Die Räumlichkeiten waren ausgesprochen sauber.
Wir spazierten von Lidia aus zu Fuß in die Altstadt (ca. 15 Minuten), öffentliche Verkehrsanbindung wäre ca. 150 m entfernt gewesen.
Bei einem weiteren Besuch in Stockholm würden wir jederzeit wieder bei Lidia übernachten!"

283,164448,161963819,2017-06-19,28482533,Claudia,"Super convenient from the Sodrä Station. Perfect place to stay if you want to explore Sodramalm (and you definitely want to). Everywhere is accessible by foot. Lidia was really lovely, she accommodated an early check in, made us coffee and circled many interesting things we should see on our short trip to Sweden. She is precise with her directions and made everything very easy for us. Thanks a lot Lidia, will definitely stay here again!  "
284,164448,164071410,2017-06-26,42963101,Ari,One of the best stays we have had. Li was so helpful and very informative on everything Stockholm. She was extremely flexible and her house was very comfortable. Location was terrific too. Definitely recommend! 
285,164448,166297913,2017-07-03,139233,Jennifer,"We enjoyed our stay at Lidia's during our five days in Stockholm.  The apartment is well located and comfortable.  Lidia was very attentive, providing excellent information about the city's cultural offerings.  We would stay with Lidia on our next trip to Stockholm!"
286,164448,171206611,2017-07-17,8287411,Ron,"From the very start, my communication with with Li was excellent: she answered quickly and in a very welcoming and pleasant way.



Before I arrived, she provided me with clear and accurate instructions how to reach her flat in three different ways - the quickest, the normal and the cheapest including buying a multi-day ticket for all the public transport in Stockholm.
I recommend buying that ticket as you can also use it for getting from and to the airport.



When I arrived, Li welcomed me and offered me a coffee. She was cordial and provide me with maps and a wide selection of explanations and recommendations for the city, museum, interesting places and transport to and from her place.

Location is very good. 5 min walk to J train to the airport, 10 min walk to 2 different Metro stops and busses. Many supermarkets around as well as coffee shops, bars and restaurants.

The room is on the second floor, which guarantees complete privacy. Li rents two rooms on that floor. Luckily for me, I was the only guest so I enjoyed a double room and a private toilet and shower.

The apartment is perfectly clean, and Li provides all the necessary things, such as a microwave, fridge, kettle, instant coffee and milk. The apartment has all the utensils and crockery to prepare a simple meal in the microwave. The room is small but has enough space for what you need with many electrical sockets. Very comfortable bed.

Li was a great host, a pleasant conversationalist if you want, but respects your privacy if you want to be alone.

I really enjoyed being in Li's flat and meeting her. She also change old banknotes for new ones when she understood that the bank would only replace notes that were out of circulation only for bank account holders.

Recommended with all my heart!

"
287,164448,172833859,2017-07-22,101573043,Eileen,Li went above and beyond expectations of a host. The space is lovely. It was nice to be near restaurants but away from all the tourist. Her apartment is located right on the major transit line and next to buses.
288,164448,174178042,2017-07-25,116197221,Xueyun,We stayed in Linda's home for there days and it was super good! The apartment was nice and tidy and it had a quiet neighborhood. Linda gave us some good advice on our travel plans which was very useful. She is a kind lady who loves guests from all over the world. Highly recommended!
289,164448,177834956,2017-08-04,111306840,Alexandre,"This place was great! It had a super comfortable bed. It was also awesome to have a living room exclusively for the guests. She also has an other room with a single bed so we also met other travellers. There is a fridge, microwave/oven, water kettle, utensils and plates that were very useful. 

"
290,164448,178750369,2017-08-06,74897865,Kyle,Li was a wonderful host and her place is very close to one of the commuter rail stations that connects to the rest of Stockholm's metro system. The room was comfortable and the neighborhood was very quiet. Would recommend Li's place to anybody!
291,164448,179691760,2017-08-08,57960340,Peter,"When we arrived at Lidia's house, she was waiting for us and gave us such a warm-hearted welcome, which made the first impression with her the best. The house is located at five to ten-minute walks from the metro stations and bus stops also. Lidia stays at the first floor, and the guests at the second floor. There were three guest teams altogether but we had no difficulty using the bathroom. We had a lot of conversation with Lidia and the other guest, a German lady, sharing cultures and experiences. The most fascinating point with Lidia was that she pinpointed some really nice tourists' attractions in Stockholm, which was quite helpful for us to visit super worthy places. We recommend Lidia's house with both our thumbs up! We will also definitely stay at her house on our next visit to Stockholm for one to two weeks. Our stay at Lidia's house was one of the best Airbnb experiences ever. Thank you for everything, Lidia. Take care.

Sincerely Yours,"

294,164448,184775909,2017-08-20,5207953,Brian,"Lidia is a great host and she went above and beyond to make sure we had a great stay. As others have noted, there is another room rented out to guests as well but this was no problem for us at all. Although it is a shared house, everything you have a private room that opens to a guest-only living room and bathroom on its own floor, so you can really have your privacy. The location was also great for us. I would highly recommend this place and would definitely return next time we are in Stockholm."
295,164448,186040414,2017-08-23,136063271,Sylvie,Situation parfaite pour découvrir les différents quartiers de Stockholm.

Estuvo siempre pendiente de nosotros, nos recibió con un café afectuosamente y nos explicó los mejores planes para nuestros cuatro días en Estocolmo. Siempre pendiente del tiempo, también se ocupó de cuál era la mejor combinación y el mejor horario para volver al aeropuerto. Si volviera a esta maravillosa ciudad, volvería a ver a Li."

Personally, I stongly suggest the (Website hidden by Airbnb) think twice ;)"

303,164448,197301718,2017-09-25,6263516,Ken,"Li's absolutely great! Her place is about a 7-min walk from two of the metros and a 15-minute walk to the Old Town. She gave me a map of Stockholm and went over all of the popular places in with me. She provided clean towels and replaced the bedding everyday, and even helped me do laundry. Li's one of the nicest people I have ever met and it was a pleasure staying with her."
304,164448,198431917,2017-09-29,95971717,Simon,Li is a great host. If I ever go to Stockholm again I know where I will stay.
305,164448,199880466,2017-10-03,7844817,Bernhard,"Eine nette ruhige und recht zental gelegene Unterkunft. Li ist sehr nett und gibt gerne Tipps zum Reiseprogramm. Gelegentlich war das Bad besetzt, es waren mit uns noch 2 andere Gäste da."

310,164448,211188222,2017-11-12,115560099,Jason,Very close to the local city railway line and super fast to get into the city center. A short walk from many of the interesting places on Söder. Li is very friendly and helped me brush up on my Swedish after not talking it for a long time. Overall a great experience and I would definitely stay here again.
311,164448,215047421,2017-11-27,9938841,Katya,Хозяйка квартиры была очень гостеприимна. Рассказала о городе и достопримечательностях. Предоставила поздний выезд.
312,164448,216857083,2017-12-06,105348559,Anna,"The host is very kind and friendly. The house has a good ubication, near one of the main stations of Stockholm"
313,164448,217826176,2017-12-10,3247693,Heleen,"We had a very good stay at Li´s home. She was extremely hospitable even after just returning from the hospital (!). The location is good, but note that with a late arrival (after 23:30) a direct connection from Arlanda by train is not possible. Room is rather small but has everything you need, and the bathroom is large. Reccomended."
314,164448,234329902,2018-02-12,52598847,Brooke,"The location of Li’s apartment is quite convenient to almost all the sightseeing places in Stockholm. And Li is an amazing host, she shared all the information we needed with us, and was very helpful! I’d definitely recommend to stay at her place."
315,164448,235572014,2018-02-17,84879393,Junfan,Li is a nice and considerate host. The communication was smooth and so was the check-in. The place is convenient for guests with several public transportation hubs are just around the corner. I enjoyed my stay in Li's apartment in Stockholm and I would definitely recommend it to others.
316,164448,237004788,2018-02-21,140744820,Patrick,Li's is a great host with a cozy apartment in a great location. Li gave easy to understand directions to get from the airport to her hotel and had helpful tips for travelling around Stockholm and things to see. Would definitely stay here again and recommend it for anyone who's looking for a convenient base of operations for a Stockholm trip.
317,164448,243550310,2018-03-16,13848227,Lea,"Li is a very attentive, generous and kind host. The room was very clean, cosy and confortable. I really recommend! Thank you for everything"
318,164448,251185530,2018-04-07,81403122,Di,Li is the best! She is kind and thoughtful. Make sure that I have everything I need. Help me get the best route. Nice kitchen. Everything is perfect! I spent 3days in her house. It made me feel we are family. Transportation is convenient as well. Highly recommend!!!
319,164448,252777443,2018-04-12,143472287,Yolaine,"Li est une personne charmante, accueillante, disponible (nous sommes arrivés à 2 h du matin et elle nous attendait). Elle est pleine de bons conseils et nous donne tous les renseignements dont nous avons besoin. 
La chambre était située à l’étage de la maison avec un salon et un coin cuisine bien agréable. C’est tout près du centre ville et nous avons tout fait à pied. 
Nous recommandons vivement."
320,164448,258996752,2018-04-30,42968886,Cinzia,"Li è una ospite perfetta. Ci ha accolto con un te e tante informazioni sulla città, davvero preziose. La stanza è carina ed accogliente.  Unico problema, non ha le imposte alla finestra e cosi alle sei la luce del giorno ci svegliava. Consiglio di portarsi mascherina per gli occhi."
321,164448,260296135,2018-05-04,107637012,Daff,"Very comfortable, spacious and bright apartment – clean and well equipped. The apartment is situated in walking distance from the city center and all attractions. Li was very friendly, helpful and hospitable. Highly recommend this place to stay in Stockholm!"
322,164448,262252128,2018-05-08,11645160,Jules,"We were very lucky to stay at Li's place. She is a terrific host - with a fondness for orchids - who makes you feel at home the moment you arrive and helps you figure out what to visit in this fantastic city. Also, the location can't be beat: Södermalm is the perfect spot from which to base your visit of the city. Place can't be beat!"
323,164448,264665772,2018-05-14,61879038,Christian,"Accueil très sympathique de Lidia qui nous attendait malgré les 90 minutes de retard de notre avion. Lidia nous a donné beaucoup d'informations  très utiles  qui nous ont grandement facilité notre séjour. Elle est très discrète mais présente en cas de besoin. L'appartement est très calme, la chambre est un peu petite mais comme on a accès à tout l'étage cela ne pose pas de problème. L'appartement est très bien situé, sur l'ile de Södermalm avec des transport en commun très pratiques surtout les bus 55 et 57 pour le centre ville qui sont à 2 minutes à pied. 
Petit conseil pour l'aller et le retour de l'aéroport Arlanda, avec la carte de transport SL 7 jours (300 couronnes pour les +65 ans) achetée au comptoir Informations de l’aéroport, nous avons pris le bus 583 (à droite en sortant du terminal 2) jusqu'à la gare de Märsta puis le train Pendeltåg qui arrive direct à 3 minutes de chez Lidia, c'est un peu plus long (55mn) que le train Express 20 mn pour le centre ville + 15 mn pour arriver chez Lidia) mais beaucoup plus économique. Notre carte SL a été amortie en 48h.
Temps superbe, ciel bleu pas un nuage pendant 6 jours, très beau souvenirs de Stockholm."
324,164448,265821468,2018-05-18,46284750,Ivan,"Li是一個非常熱情和友善的房東,她為我們在斯德哥爾摩的行程提供了很多建議｡房間非常整潔,設備齊全,位置也很方便,從Li的家走到火車站只需3-5分鐘,附近也有超市和餐廳｡如果要來斯德哥爾摩,我會推薦Li的家｡"
325,164448,267885931,2018-05-23,133287338,Nathan,"Li was a spectacular host. She sat down and gave us a wonderful overview of the city and the ""must sees"". The space is large and bright, with lots of amenities. It's very close to trains, but a nice 30 min walk to Old Towne."
326,164448,269464566,2018-05-27,169327061,Maxine,"Li is a nice host - she was informative of the area and things to do. The common area upstairs is shared among three rooms and that area is nice place to have conversations. The location of this place is close by to the T, so getting around everywhere is fast and easy."
327,164448,271128480,2018-05-31,48918400,Ho Kwan,A very nice host! Wait for me and gave me a detailed overview of the city even I am late due to flight delay! One of my best traveling experience!
328,164448,274819822,2018-06-10,130752780,Tyler,Li has a great apartment in the very trendy Södermalm area of Stockholm. It’s a 20-30 minute to every tourist spot other than the Skansen area which is a little bit further. The train station however is only a 3 minute walk from the apartment. Li’s house is very clean and the room was a fine size for my girlfriend and I. Li also gave us some fantastic recommendations on what to do while in Stockholm. We really enjoyed our stay with Li and would definitely stay with her again.
329,164448,276221789,2018-06-13,22390969,Maxwell,"Li is an incredibly gracious host with an encyclopedic knowledge of Stockholm’s attractions and, probably more importantly, its well designed but fairly complicated public transportation system. Her apartment is comfortable, clean, and has a lovely living area to relax, read,  and enjoy a cup of coffee or tea while you recharge for late night outings in Stockholm. The place is a few minutes walk from parks, public swimming areas, attractive neighborhoods, a spectacular statue of Thor slaying a vicious sea serpent named Jörmungandr, and a walking path along a cliff that gives you the best views of the city at night. I couldn’t have asked for a better place to stay in beautiful Stockholm. "
330,164448,281595748,2018-06-25,6298826,Cassidy,Li was awesome! Thanks so much for having us!
331,164448,282878669,2018-06-28,83527120,Becky,"It is really a great experience to practice Yoga with Solveig’s perfect instructions. There are a few things that I am really impressed on: 1)
She chooses a perfect location which is outdoor while can enjoy the sun, the wind and the Frankfurt City sky view at the same time; 2) Solveig’s coaching is with her own peace and enjoyment that I can feel the calmness and I believe she enjoys the process for each coaching; 3) There are some certain Yoga post that I am always struggle on for years but Solveig gave me excellent tips that how to correct my movement; 4) It was also a surprise that her Airbnb booking includes an detail Frankfurt guide with a decent presentation, moreover she arranged a coffee time in the Cafe that we both can relax and talk for our life and lifestyle right after the Yoga Practice. It is a very good experience, worth recommending! "
332,164448,283065271,2018-06-29,16138142,Christiaan & Penny,"Staying at Li's place is like staying at your favourite aunt's house. She welcomes you with a cup of coffee or tea, makes your bed, hang up your towels and clears away your dishes when you've gone out for the day. She couldn't be kinder and more generous. Her location in Södermalm was a perfect base for our adventures in Stockholm. We were able to walk to pretty much anywhere we wanted to go. Thanks for the tip about where to swim in the river and meatballs at Made in Sweden. Great host!"
333,164448,286395142,2018-07-06,175926807,Diana,"Li's place is in an excellent location to be able to walk or jump on the metro to any where in the city. Li is a sweet lady and when you arrive she has a city map ready for you and will go over where to find things in the city. WiFi is strong and works well.

The following reasons are why I did not give Li's place a 5.
The address is to the apartment complex not her apartment so you need to has access to a phone to call her to let you in.

She uses her upstairs for Airbnb. There are three bedrooms and one bath. At times the bathroom is in use so you need to plan your day accordingly to maybe having to wait to get into the bathroom.

She does not give kitchen privileges though she has a small microwave and refrigerator is the small sitting room upstairs. So if you plan on eating a lot of your meals there they will all have to be microwaveable. She has no coffee pot, just instant coffee. To get water and wash dishes you need to use the bathroom sink.

Her TV's are the old tube type before remote controls. The picture is very fuzzy. If relaxing with TV after a long day is something you do, you won't be able to do that here.

She has no black out curtains on the windows. We were there in July and the sun hits you in the face at 3:30 am. I was lucky enough to have an eye mask that I got on the plane or there would have been no way I could have slept in that room

There is no visible electric outlet in the bathroom so hair drying etc has to be done in your room.

Li will come into your room during the day and make your bed and straighten your things, even if the door is locked. If you do not want her to come into your room you will need to let her know that when you check in."
334,164448,289792128,2018-07-13,13541212,Thodoris,The place is really central; very close to the Sodra station (2-3mins) and in walking distance  from the Old Town and most other places. The room was good; everything you would expect from a short-term stay. Li was very good in making check in extremely convenient and was also extremely hospitable. I definitely recommend the place.
335,164448,291657658,2018-07-16,53906489,吴依秋,"Li is really really kind to give us suggestions useful information about the city. We felt  sorry to arrive at her place quite early in the morning, but she waited for us kindly and welcomed. The room is tidy and the location is also nice close to the train station södra and metro station. A perfect holiday here and i’m Sure to come back again "
336,164448,293324526,2018-07-20,4330799,Brianna,"Li was such a great host! Her place has a great location,  comfortable bed and she was so helpful!"
337,164448,296778795,2018-07-26,92946108,Luca,"Solveig is offering an exceptional Yoga experience. We met in a wonderful spot in Frankfurt downtown on the riverside, where there also was a  beautiful view of the Skyline.
The practice itself fits to all level. I am a intermediate beginner :) and the day after I could feel the benefits of the lesson.
At the end we also had a little talk together with all other participants and Solveig gave also us a very nice travel guide with her best tips for Frankfurt! Thank you Solveig! It was fun!"
338,164448,296778858,2018-07-26,14545388,Maggie,"Such a great experience. Lovely location by the river. Solveig is a wonderful host, a great yoga teacher who tailors the experience to your level. Her local knowledge about Frankfurt is also so helpful, even for someone who has been here a while. Definitely recommend, whether you’re living here or just visiting! "
339,164448,296779094,2018-07-26,40220570,Ines,"Great experience to try yoga or continue practicing. Solveig was very attentive not only during class but also sharing her tips about the city. The place was also very nice, by the riverside, with a beautiful view for some pics and a nearby cafe perfect for a sunset drink. Loved the experience!  What an amazing way to end the day,  enjoy a different perspective of the city and create a good memory. "
340,164448,296779185,2018-07-26,168744336,Jana,"I really enjoyed the whole experience, chill-out yoga with a view over the skyline and a drink in the end. Tips for interesting Frankfurt places were valuable as well. Solveig is very nice, there are no downsides about the experience."
341,164448,297275207,2018-07-27,55940462,Esther,"I had a really good experience with Solveig. She is a great yoga teacher but also a very nice and warm person that makes you feel comfortable throughout the class. The practice is suitable for all levels and time and location were perfect. At the end of the class, she also shared with us very useful tips about Frankfurt and nice spots while we had a drink. 100% recommendable :)"
342,164448,297275796,2018-07-27,16592532,Alicia,"I really enjoyed this yoga class. It was in the perfect location, I was able to see the skyline of the city and we were right next to the river. Solveig was super nice, I really enjoyed her as a yoga instructor. After the class she shared with us a travel guide of the best places to go in Frankfurt and gave us coconut water so enjoy after the class. I will definitely go back to her class. If you are visiting or new to the city I definitely recommend this class. "
343,164448,297278664,2018-07-27,49186290,Ida,"It was a great experience, Solveig is very competent and nice and she held the class in an appropriate level for the participants. I also appreciated that she shared her favorite spots in Frankfurt with us, very helpful for people that are new to the city!"
344,164448,307281971,2018-08-14,10676689,Heather,"Li was flexible about arrival time and check-in and gave good directions to reach her flat from the Södra station. In the check-in process she provided a map of Stockholm, oriented us to public transportation options, and gave her recommendations on things to do. 

Li also let us switch rooms at check-in for a bit more space. We enjoyed the common area, fridge, and microwave that she makes available to her guests - perfect for staying in on a rainy day. As you are in the upper floor of the flat, it can get a little stuffy when the weather is hot (as it was while we were there). Probably not an issue other times of the year or in cooler summers. 

We found the location very convenient - about a 20 min walk to Gamla Stan - but we also loved exploring Södermalm, which is a great neighborhood, with great dining options within a 5-10 min walk. All in all, we enjoyed our stay very much - it felt more like staying with family than an AirBnB. 
"
345,164448,311067308,2018-08-20,71971282,Martin,"If you decide to do a yoga session with Solveig you can expect to meet a very friendly, kind and considerate yoga teacher. I very much enjoyed the session and the subsequent drink at the very stylish bar. Here, with a view of the skyline of central Frankfurt, Solveig kindly shared her tips for what to see and do in Frankfurt when one only has so much time to spend there. Very nice combo, yoga + info on Frankfurt"
346,164448,312838473,2018-08-24,140903467,Sara,Ottima esperienza! La casa è molto carina e accogliente e Li è una signora meravigliosa
347,164448,315211732,2018-08-28,154757720,Isabelle,We had a great 3 days in Stockholm staying at Li's place. It is a little cluttered and the furnishings are old fashioned but everything was clean and nothing lacking. The location is perfect. Li gave us some very useful tips when we arrived.
348,164448,316332466,2018-08-31,211325542,Marit,"Li is een hartstikke aardige vrouw die er alles aan doet om je verblijf bij haar zo prettig mogelijk te maken. Je mag haar altijd alles vragen en daar geeft ze ook graag antwoord op. Aan het begin van ons verblijf heeft ze ons allemaal tips gegeven over wat er te zien is in Stockholm en na het horen van onze voorkeuren wist ze nog wat meer specifieke tips te geven, waardoor ons verblijf in Stockholm zeker beter is geworden! In het verblijf zelf zijn de meubels wat oud, maar er hangt wel een hele gezellige sfeer. De badkamer is erg schoon en de douche is verrassend lekker. De bedden sliepen heerlijk en ook had Li er zelf al voor gezorgd dat er genoeg stopcontacten waren. Al met al een heerlijk verblijf hier gehad en we zouden het zeker aanraden!"
349,164448,318088446,2018-09-03,15599549,Anne-Sophie,"We had a wonderful stay in Li’s apartment. The location is ideal to explore Stockholm by foot as well as hop on many public transit options as needed. The room was clean with two single beds put together to sleep which wasn’t a problem for me and my husband. We shared the bathroom with another girl who was also staying at the apartment during our stay but we never overlapped. 
Li’s extremely nice, she welcomed us with Tea on our first day and gave us a map with highlights of the main sights. 

I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a convenient place to visit Stockholm."
350,164448,325538289,2018-09-20,11104454,Ronald,"Li was a wonderful host. The room was clean and comfortable. The location was great, since it was next to the metro.  Li was very keen on helping us find our way and was happy to share her knowledge of Stockholm. :)"
351,164448,329532947,2018-09-29,31480145,Silvia,"Li is a special host: very kind and gentle. You'll find a special room with a shared bathroom but there are no problem at all. The room is spacious for two people and the metro, pendeltag and buses are very near. You can go everywhere without any problem and you can reach the centre of the city by bus or by metro in few minutes.
Li can give you some useful advices to visit better the city and she is always ready to talk and help you planning your visit. If you are searching a beautiful spot in Stockholm, you have to choose this flat."

357,164448,352358605,2018-11-25,69418483,Jock,"#adorable!
This little firecracker LOVES her adopted city and loves helping you navigate it.  Be prepared for a 20-30min tutorial when you first meet her.  She’s a storehouse of knowledge about the local sites and how to get to them.  (Ask her about the solar system display.)  
Her complex is HUGE and I got turned around more than once, but getting there via metro or bus is ridiculously easy ONCE YOU GET YOUR BEARINGS. 
I would certainly stay there again!"

Her house is warm and makes me feeling like being at home.  It just takes you 5 minutes to get to the stations and you could get the city center within 15 minutes. There are some supermarket nearby too. This is absolutely the best choice for you in Stockholm, it would not disappoint you. Thanks Li creating a good memory for me in this city."

375,164448,449996074,2019-05-08,256006024,Noah,"Li was a fantastic host. When we first booked, she reached out and communicated with us about directions from the airport and welcomed us to Stockholm. When we had questions, she was prompt and detailed in her responses, and when we arrived, she sat us down for 30 min with a map and museum brochures to help us refine our itinerary. She was the perfect host in terms of giving us the privacy we wanted, but always being available if we had any questions. She clearly has lots of experience hosting and providing a comfortable environment for travelers who just want a cozy space to come back to in the evenings. In addition, her home in Sodermalm is in a great location for the walking traveler. Thank you Li for providing such a welcoming and memorable experience in Stockholm - I hope to be back again in the coming years!"

390,164448,498731198,2019-07-30,29452418,Maria,"Quarto e banheiro muito confortáveis, limpos, boa área de estar. Li é muito prestativa e muito interessada em oferecer ajuda. Tivemos problemas com nossa bagagem que não chegou e ela logo nos ofereceu escova de dentes na chegada. Nos ajudou na intermediação com a empresa aérea quando precisamos que recebesse mensagens e a própria bagagem qdo foi entregue.  Voltaria a me hospedar em seu apartamento"

Even more importantly, though, Li is a lovely host and extremely helpful with local tips, maps, and guides.  When we arrived, Li brewed us a cup of coffee and sat down with us for a quick summary of what to do in Stockholm.  She made us feel very welcome, and gave us great suggestions for what to do with our time in the city.

Can’t recommend enough!"
395,164448,512134592,2019-08-18,244324220,Steffi,Wir hatten eine sehr schöne Zeit in Stockholm und waren mit der Unterkunft sehr zufrieden. Li ist eine sehr nette Gastgeberin und nimmt sich gerne etwas Zeit Fragen zu beantworten oder Sightseeing tipps zu geben.
396,164448,514512132,2019-08-21,29439449,Kristelli Mari,Lovely home and easy access to a lot of places people want to visit. I had the best sleep here and feels like home. The receiving/living area is one of the best touches of the house forme. The neighborhood is such a secured and friendly place. I would recommend Li's place. I would love to stay there again!
397,164448,516209932,2019-08-24,38500148,Ricardo,everything was very good

Li is very hospitable person, very warm and helpful. I definitely recommend her place! It was a big pleasure, thank you Li! :)"

She is always there to help in case of any questions and her tips are extremely useful for tourists. Overall we had an excellent stay at her place."
400,164448,523739927,2019-09-04,105822540,Julia,"Li is an incredibly sweet lady, who immediately makes you feel welcome in her home. When we arrived, she offered us all kinds of brochures and maps of Stockholm, explained its different areas and public transit. The room, the TV room and the washroom are very clean and orderly. The apartment is located perfectly, close to several tram, bus, and metro stations, as well as the hip area of Södermalm with its thousand bars and restaurants. Li is an amazing host, who made our stay a great experience."
401,164448,526017713,2019-09-08,238052639,Natalia,"Li’s place is perfectly located - quiet and safe (even in the late evening/at night), but also very near to main streets of Södermalm, numerous underground/bus stops (only a few minutes away from the Old Town/Gamla Stan, or half an hour’s walk), lots of lovely cafés and restaurants as well. Li is a great, hospitable host, with excellent knowledge of the city and always happy to share tips and suggestions. In her apartment there are a few different rooms for guests, but it’s really nice and quiet at all times as everyone respects the common space. There is a pleasant sitting area for guests on a separate floor, with microwave, fridge, cutlery/cups etc. for guests. Generally, anything you might need is available - toiletries, hairdryers, ironing facilities etc. There is no full kitchen available, but we - and most guests probably - didn’t find it problematic as there is the microwave and lots of cheap places to get food/eat out around. The room we had was very warm (there’s a fan available too!), clean and decorated in a quaint, old-fashioned style with lots of books; plenty of storage space too. The place is very well maintained and we were well looked after - I would definitely recommend Li’s place as it is great value for money (especially location, location, location!)."
402,164448,529210012,2019-09-14,4608535,Laura,"Li was warm and welcoming with a cup of tea when I arrived and gave me a run down of the local transit, points of interest and navigating in Stockholm. The place was clean, cozy, and quiet. She was easily available, but also gave me space and privacy. There is one other room she rents out, but I hardly noticed the other person and this didn’t district my stay at all. This was well located and near groceries and transit. I was able to easily get downtown and to my conference at the south of the city without issue. Would stay here again if I am ever in Stockholm. Thanks Li!"
403,164448,531671483,2019-09-18,287149921,Riccardo,"Posto accogliente e molto pulito. Zona perfetta per chi vuole visitare Stoccolma. Li è adorabile, molto disponibile e gentilissima. Consigliatissimo!"

406,170651,443898,2011-08-14,827381,Tamara,"Marie S is the best flat owner :)  The apartment looks just like the photos.  It was spotless, and she left delicious fresh fruit and coffee to welcome me to Stockholm.  The flat is located in an amazing location for long walks and is close to transportation all over Stockholm.  I can't say enough about how nice Marie is, and how lovely it was that she trusted me with her plants.  Also, the balcony is wonderful and romantic.  Love her and her flat.  "
407,170651,495351,2011-09-02,879815,Derk,"Nice location, well equipped kitchen, nice sunny balcony. 
If you are travelling with a small baby, as we did, it is good to know that the elevator is rather small. Our baby carriage did not fit in (unless dismounted), which was a bit impractical.
Also, from the practical standpoint, we would have liked a normal size table and some more electric light (instead of the many candles), but I suppose this is a question of taste."
408,170651,580334,2011-09-29,958351,Stefano,Nice and clean apartment. Good location (close to subway). Very kind landlord.
409,170651,785773,2011-12-14,1309213,Audrey&Benoit,"Marie's place is totally cute and close to everything you need, supermarket down the street, great bars ,metro station ...
The appartment was a real pleasure to stay in, really clean, feeling fresh and cosy, big enough for two . we loved it .Marie's been really great with us as well, from showing us things to check on the map to making sure everything was ok , an overall 5 stars experience. "
410,170651,1009721,2012-03-17,1814871,Olivia,"Lovely apartment and wonderful host!
Close to metro and supermarket. 
"
411,170651,1117372,2012-04-12,1982414,Zoe,"At the risk of sounding sycophantic, I cannot recommend Marie and her apartment more highly! Marie is gorgeously friendly and helpful- going well beyond the duty of a host; I was welcomed by a cafetiere in the sun on her balcony and spent the next two hours chatting away and being given invaluable local tips and advice! The apartment is an oasis of bright, light calm and wonderfully located in vibrant Hornstull, just round the corner from the Tunnelbanna (although why anyone would take public transport in a city so lovely to walk around beats me). Five star stay in every way- the only downside was having to come back to London... Go to Stockholm, stay at Marie's, just don't you dare try to book the same days as me (I'll definitely be coming back)! Thank you so much again, Marie. Z x "
412,170651,1315141,2012-05-21,1328312,Adele,"We loved Marie's little heaven on the roof top! it was really cosy and we felt at home! 
Marie is really easy to deal with and we had no problem arranging for the keys even though our plane landed close to midnight.
The area is really convenient! you will find nice little restaurants, supermarket, bakery, tube/bus station within few hundred metres. Also one of Stockholm ""beaches is not far from the flat.
I'll be back in Stockholm and most probably in Marie's flat!

"
413,170651,1674806,2012-07-10,2274023,Varvara,Thank Marie for wonderful staying in Stocholm! Apartment is very clean and cozy. Marie is very attentive owner. I advise everyone to stay in her apartment! 
414,170651,1738691,2012-07-18,552942,Shaun,"Marie's flat is lovely. Very chilled and bohemian. The local neighourhood is great - lots of nice coffee bars, cafes and close to the water. It's a bit more alternative than other parts of Stockholm we visited - and all the better for it. Metro is 5 mins walk away, so it's easy to get to the centre. Recommend it & Marie is really nice too."
415,170651,1881645,2012-08-04,2173519,Nicole,"Marie is just as lovely as her apartment. It is in a great location. You are close to everything great bars, cafes and the metro stop. Marie was accommodating, sweet and responsive. We had a wonderful time in Stockholm and owe much of it to Marie and her ""petite charm rooftop next to heaven."" The name is very fitting. Thank you Marie!"

419,170651,24377367,2014-12-27,13567048,Svenja,I stayed with my family around christmas in maries wonderful apartement. Everything was decorated so lovely and we felt very comfortable. Marie was very helpful with every questions we had and otherwise everything else went well too.
420,170651,30424511,2015-04-21,30974111,Mariangela,"The apartment is very nice, and very easy to get around from it. Nice cafés, an independent cinema around the block, good metro connection and the plus of an airport bus around the corner. Beautiful plants keep you company while visiting Stockholm. Will stay there again. It feels like a home, and beds are very comfortable. The balcony is very nice."

 i never met the owner , it is a jungle inside with 40 types of flowers, many flees inside, it stinks, very old fourniture , nothing to cook inside , NO WIFI !!! No real bed but something on the floor, 
The owner seems to be cool then she became a Monster because she puts fourniture on her balcony and rain went on it and she accused me of this, i am not responsable of the weather !
This owner uses each details to earn money, it is scary and the end of The trip was a nightmare , she was agressive, moreover i had to clean all this accommodation before checking out and she charged me 35 $, !!!! I was Shocked and so sad, this woman plays with people and i Would never recommand this place , it is a nightmare and the area is dangerous, not safe, homeless and drug dealer !!!! Forget it Thats an advice of someone who travel a lot and who never believe this could happening "
423,170651,42721148,2015-08-15,10876144,Jennifer,"Marie is a very charming and thoughtful host. She made us feel welcome and was quick to answer any question we had. Her apartment is neat, clean and adorable. If you have a heart for plants, you will absolutely love this place. It is ideally located in short walking distance to the metro, a big park and a beach. Raw food café and gluten free bakery just around the corner. Perfect place for ourstay in Stockholm. Thank you for having us, Marie!!!"
424,170651,44317682,2015-08-25,34197258,Nadia,"The flat looks exactly like in the pictures, it is beautiful and neat with a lovely balcony. The area is great; public transport, shops, restaurants and parks are just around the corner. Marie is also a fantastic and welcoming host. Thank you Marie for letting us stay in your home!

The only downside is that there is no WIFI in this flat (as advertised) and this caused me quite a problem as it prevented me from working. I got the code to the neighbours WIFI network but it would only work at times in the hallway. "
425,170651,79419650,2016-06-12,2479915,Alex,"The apartment is in a great location - close to major transit but also very quiet! Great layout, perfect for 2-3 people. The kitchen is very well equipped with basics. The beds are comfortable. The space itself is tight, but works well for a few people. There is no seating, however - which was an issue when making a sit-down meal. The patio/balcony was a great place to sit and enjoy the sun! Very easy to communicate with Marie. Wifi was great (except we accidentally unplugged the router thing, and it eventually ran out of battery and we struggled to figure out how to get internet back!) The room does not have dark curtains; hopefully not an issue for others. Bathroom was a little tight, but doable - no shower curtain, which was odd. I would recommend this place to anyone! Also, the cat is very cute, cuddly/friendly! "
426,170651,88177487,2016-07-23,53716247,Christiane,"Wir hatten auch Dank Maries kleiner, liebevoll eingerichteten, süßen Wohnung samt zuckersüßem Grisen (Kater) einen traumhaften Aufenthalt in Stockholm. Sommer pur, somit konnten wir auch den Balkon voll ausnutzen, was eine echte Bereicherung für die Wohnung ist! Die Lage ist klasse, Strand, Restaurants, Supermarkt und öffentliche Verkehrsmittel (inkl. Flughafenbus nach Arlanda) sind nur 5 Min. entfernt, perfekt! Wir konnten Marie leider nicht persönlich kennenlernen, aber die Kommunikation mit ihr im Vorfeld war super und sie hat alles für uns hergerichtet und eine nette ""Anleitung"" verfasst, so dass wir keine weitere Hilfe benötigt haben (wäre aber durch ihre Schwester in der Nähe möglich gewesen!). Wir würden auf jeden Fall wiederkommen und vermissen Grisen bereits sehr!!"

429,170651,173396036,2017-07-23,43319,Emma,"We had a very nice stay in Marie's flat. The apartment looks exactly like the pictures. As the flat is placed on the 5th floor, there's a lot of light, there are lots of plants, a neat little kitchen and a cosy balcony. The apartment is located in a great area, close to the water, green areas/parks, good cafés and public transport. Marie was a very helpful and attentive host. I can definitely recommend to stay in Marie's flat."

432,170651,354746596,2018-12-02,128131847,Paulina,"Hi
Marie's place is great. Really comfy. In the kitchen there are all neccessary things. In the apartment there is a lot of plants which adds extra charm. No insects ! as i read in some mean comment here. Cat which will stay with you when Marie will be off is really sweet and he loves all people from first sight ( what was strange for me as cats usually don't like strangers:) ) Apartament is close to the subway and bus station. Next to the metro station ( so 4 min of walk) there are shops, cafes and similar places.  And communcation with Marie is really great-  on airbnb and via telephone. I recomend this place very very much!"

434,170651,446360534,2019-05-01,39507296,Ross,"Marie's home is a lovely green space, ideally located with a bus stop outside and super market and metro 5 min walk away. Most of Stockholm is 30-50min away depending on your choice of transport.

We were lucky to have good weather and it was especially lovely to share a wine on the balcony after putting our baby to bed.

A slight issue with cat hair and some allergies is the only reason we couldn't give Marie a perfect 5."
435,170651,451812170,2019-05-12,233826932,Angelika,Marie is very friendly ;) . The Appartement is lovely. We've spend a nice time there. Everything was fine. We will come back :)
436,170651,455823624,2019-05-20,11504899,Janina,"Mein Freund und ich verbrachten ein verlängertes Wochenende in Maries kleinen aber netten und sauberen Apartment. Die Wohnung ist mit allem ausgestattet, was man braucht und insbesondere der Balkon ist ein Highlight. Die Kommunikation mit Marie verlief einwandfrei und die Lage der Wohnung hat uns gut gefallen. Zum einen gibt es einige Läden direkt um die Ecke, zum anderen ist die Anbindung an die öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln und auch zum Flughafen super. 
Auch wenn wir große Katzenliebhaber sind, empfanden wir die nächtliche Aktivität des sonst sehr liebenswerten Katers (welcher auf Wunsch aber vielleicht nicht anwesend ist) als störend, insbesondere da es keine Tür zum Schlafzimmer gibt."
437,170651,463405431,2019-06-03,20508772,Anna,"Great atmosphere, nice apartment and is everything clean. 
We spent a weekend in Stockholm, Marie’s apartment is perfect for saying in this wonderful city. It is close to the subway and to a beautiful walking-way to the center of the city (Glam Stan). 
I really recommend you to stay in this beautiful place. 
And then Marie has a lovely cat that will be the best host you can ever meet!"
438,170651,521783701,2019-09-01,233826932,Angelika,"We spend second time in Maries Apartment. It is a beautyful place to spend some days in Stockholm. Marie is such a nice, friendly, lovely person. We will come back. Thank you for everything Marie "
439,206221,756589,2011-11-30,1439830,I,"It was my great time with host Elisabeth Söderhäll. she is very friendly, easy going and helpful person.  I recommend other people if you want to feel home far from home you must stay at Elisabeth Söderhäll flat"
440,206221,788432,2011-12-16,1419359,Francis Mark,Good Location. We took around close to 10minutes walk from the train stop. 15 to 20 minutes walk to Gamla Stan. Elisabeth was very friendly and helpful in providing us with information on where to go. Overall would recommend to stay as the location is very good.
441,206221,898154,2012-02-02,602931,Vivek,"Elisabeth has a wonderful apartment close to the central street in Sodermalm, which we were told by many people is the place to be in Stockholm (it's a very fun neighborhood.) The room is quiet & she keeps the apartment very clean; we didn't use the kitchen except to eat the (very tasty) breakfasts she prepared for us, so I'm not sure if cooking is OK, but I'm sure you could ask her.

One note - there are two single twin beds in the room against different walls, so if you're a couple you'll sleep separately. But everythings very comfortable."
442,206221,1180784,2012-04-25,2091931,Themistocles,"We are very excited about our holidays in the house of Elizabeth while the house is situated near the picturesque old city of Stockholm and is also close to subway. It combines both a quiet stay and an easy access to the surrounding streets that are full of life, with snack bar, bistros and bars to go out in the night. The room was very spacious, sunny and clean, classily decorated with Elizabeth’s taste, with a very nice view of Katarina Bangata STR. The breakfast was very rich, and kept us from eating until the evening. But the biggest advantage of all was the hostess, always cheerful and friendly with a good motivation and a tip for the guests. We strongly recommend this house."
443,206221,1216898,2012-05-02,1595524,Natalia,"Elisabeth is very kind and friendly. Her apartment is very pleasant and close to the city center. Room is big, there are more than enough space for 2 persons. The breakfast was very rich and tasty. We had a great time and we recommend it ! Thanks again for all! "
444,206221,1419307,2012-06-05,2092065,Pablo,"We loved Stockholm and we really liked Elisabeth´s place. The house is big and nice and the bedroom is also more than enough to spend some days. Big bedroom with space enough for the luggage. Personally, I loved the location. The Sofo area is a cool, dynamic and beautiful area with lot of cafés, nice shops, restaurants and supermarkets around. Just perfect. If you don´t mind to walk, you can even walk for a while to the old side of the city. Elisabeth is a great host who sure is going to make you feel at home. As they said, breakfasts are more than great and her company and advice are a big plus. "
445,206221,1455657,2012-06-11,28365,Beto,"Elisabeth's place is a great option in Stockholm. 
She's a very nice, friendly and helpful host. 
The flat is really big and awesome. Big kitchen, big bright bathroom, nice balcony at the top floor, well furnished guest room (closet, chairs, tables, armchair...). 
The location is fantastic: there are many bars and restaurants in the neighbourhood (and it's still very quiet at night), the metro station is 5min walk away and it's just 2 stops away from the Old Town / 3 from Central Station. 
And the breakfast made by Elisabeth is delicious and would fill the hungriest traveller!"
446,206221,1508926,2012-06-18,1392057,Caroline,"Elisabeth's place is not only nice, Elisabeth herself is a wonderful host. We were really welcome and our little son loved it too.
Elisabeth showed us a bit around and had good advices. We had very nice discussions as well and the whole stay was a really peaceful and happy one.
We would definitely recommend people to book a room there!"
447,206221,1555989,2012-06-25,113955,Clementine,"Elisabeth has a room with two single beds, perfect for two friends travelling. It is located in the cool spot of Stockholm, hip Sodermalm. Elisabeth made us a yummy breakfast and gave us good travelling tips! I totally recommend staying with her, it is lovely.

448,206221,1980525,2012-08-14,2349239,Cristiana,"Elisabeth is a delightful hostess. Does everything possible to make its guests feel at home. I felt like an old friend on a visit. The house is close to the metro and in a nice area with many bars and restaurants. The breakfast is rich and the room like the one in your home. You share the bathroom with her, but Elisabeth is very discreet. If I returned to Stockholm no doubt still go to her"
449,206221,2062757,2012-08-22,1823544,Philbert,"Elisabeth added another dimension to our stay in Stockholm with her many stories and insight into both her life and Stockholm. She was a gracious and warm host and her place is neat and full of character.

The location of this room is good, situated in the middle of Sodermalm, where there are plenty of trendy restaurants, cafes and bars around, despite the quiet street the flat is actually on. It is a 10 minute walk from Gamla Stan and a 15-20 minute walk from the city centre.

The room and bathroom were spacious and is suitable for up to 2 guests. Elisabeth also provided a very nice breakfast. Although the facilities were shared, Elisabeth was very discrete and respected privacy. This place does not have wifi. However, this was not too much of an issue because of the short walking distances around Stockholm. Elisabeth was kind enough to research information about getting around Stockholm, weather etc on our behalf when requested.

Highly recommend Elisabeth's room for one or two travellers."
450,206221,2176688,2012-09-03,2452548,Marko,"Elisabeth is a very charming host whose amiability added a very important and enjoyable dimension to our experience of Stockholm and Sweden. The room in her apartment is very comfortable, an apartment itself well located."
451,206221,2265069,2012-09-11,3310577,Gilles,"We spent one week at Elisabeth's place in Stockholm. The apartment is well situated, between 2 metro stations yet it's in a calm street.
She was nice and welcoming. And although she is living in that flat too, we had a spare key and so were free to go come and go whenever we wanted. And sure the breakfast we had every morning was nicer than buying a pair of rolls every single day.
All in all it was a nice stay, much better than any hostels or low price hotels you can find for the same price. Only one thing we regret, there were two single beds in our romm with no possibility to put them side by side.
That being said, we recommend this facility if you're about to visit the beautiful city of Stockholm, capital of Sweden."
452,206221,2830063,2012-11-07,3516430,Teresa,"Really great experience staying with Elisabeth. Her apartment is clean, big and an unbeatable location. The room is quite comfortable and she is an excellent host, she made a number of suggestions for places to eat, things to see and gave us lots of helpful tips on how to get from a to b. Highly recommend! "
453,206221,2981714,2012-11-27,3430240,Brock,"Elisabeth was a wonderful host and the room was just perfect for us. The apartment is very well located, on a side street in one of the cooler parts of town. In fact it's only a few minutes walk to what we discovered was the best club, ""Under Bron"", and not so far from the touristic sites like the Old Town.

The breakfast each morning was tasty and filling, usually giving us enough energy to make it until late in the afternoon before eating again - an important detail when considering how unfathomably expensive Stockholm is, especially for us poor Berliners.  The beds were very comfortable and were set up next to each other although they can be moved around depending on your relational situation.

It was our first time using AirBnB and we very much enjoyed it! The only thing to note is that there is no Wi-Fi although there is a nice cafe just a few doors down that has Wi-Fi and keeps decent hours. Overall, would definitely return if/when we come back to Stockholm!"
454,206221,6327102,2013-08-08,7370812,Benedictine,"We spent a wonderful time at Elisabeth's home. She is such a warmhearted woman and a very caring host. The room was comfortable and clean as well as the bathroom. Elisabeth prepared us a delicious breakfast every morning and gave us always the feeling to be welcome. The localisation of the appartment is perfect: Södermalm is very nice and a good place to start your tour through Stockholm, close to nature as well as to restaurants, cafés and the sights of Stockholm. If you want, Elisabeth gives advices what to see in Stockholm and what you could do during the stay.
We absolutely recommend you to stay there."
455,206221,7243318,2013-09-13,7469392,Julianna,"Elisabeth is a very kind, friendly and helpful host and her flat and the room we had there was very confortable and convenient. We had to leave very early in the morning and she prepared a fantastic ""breakfast box"" for us which was really very kind of her! We definitely offer her as a host to anyone. Thanks, Elisabeth!

On discute le matin autour d'un excellent petit-déjeuner et Elisabeth peut vous conseiller des visites et des activités intéressantes.
Bref, l'adresse est excellente, l'hôtesse aimable et souriante. A recommander!"
458,206221,12830443,2014-05-12,13402798,Chetan,Fantastic neighborhood. Pretty much in the center of the hip and trendy district. The apartment is cozy and as described. Quick responses from the host made the logistics of staying there very easy. 
459,206221,13478154,2014-05-28,14116606,Youssef,"Elisabeth has been an ideal host for my parents who really appreciated their stay from the first to the last minute at her place. She is a very friendly person who also happens to be very available and provide good tourism advises. 
The location of her accommodation is hardly beatable since it is very close from the center in a very cozy district.
I definitely recommend it!"
460,206221,14241125,2014-06-15,15807347,Priska,"Stockholm war das erste Reiseziel mit airbnb. Wir hatten Glück, daß wir zu Elisabeth kamen.der Empfang war gut organisiert und wir fühlten uns sehr willkommen.
Elisabeth ist ein sehr herzlicher, freundlicher und hilfsbereiter Mensch. Das Zimmer und das Badezimmer waren sauber und alles was wir benötigten war vorhanden. Weiche Betten, haben aber hervorragend darin geschlafen.
Das Wohngebiet liegt zentral und vieles war gut zu Fuß zu erreichen. Es leben sehr viele junge Menschen dort und überall gibt es nette Bars und Restaurants.
Das Frühstück war lecker und reichlich.
Wir würden jederzeit wieder zu Elisabeth kommen.

L'appartement est situé dans un quartier très calme, pourtant central, et proche des transports. Nous avons beaucoup aimé l'atmosphère de ce quartier. 
La chambre était agréable, la salle de bains lumineuse, et les petits déjeuners copieux.
En bref une très bonne adresse, où nous aimerions retourner."

Nonostante il nostro arrivo molto in ritardo, è stata così carina da aspettarci in piedi ad accoglierci.
La posizione della casa è ottima! Vicino la metro, vicino una zona piena di ristorantini. Tutto diventava raggiungibile a piedi!
Vivamente consigliato!!"

She is just so nice, easygoing, soft, helpful, and you can feel your heart from her eyes directly!
We were so happy in all days that we spent in her house...
She just let us felt in home since the first second that we met each other!
MY FIRST TIME in airb&b and I just fell I met the exactly person that sounds with my soul ;)
Thanks Elisabeth for all... You are part of us: as old souls we are!

She was incredibly kind, made us a delicious breakfast, and showed us around. We had really nice conversations with her, and she made us feel very much at home. 
The home was also perfect. There was enough space, the beds were good, and the kitchen was also nice!
The location of the apartment is also good. It's in a neighbourhood with lots of small shops and restaurants. 
We would definitely recommend Elisabeth and her apartment!"
467,206221,42247936,2015-08-12,9627339,Paul-Jürgen,"Elisabeth was very helpful in organising our stay.  She replied immediately to all messages.  The room is exactly as advertised (with the tiny exception that the two beds we rearranged to stand next to each other).  The whole flat is perfectly tidy.  The location is great, in a beautiful, very calm alley in the center of the 'hip' area of Stockholm.  Public transport is available within a few minutes' walking distance.  Breakfast was rich and delicious, and provided us a good start into our days.

Elisabeth is a true gem.  Her light-hearted nature and her incredible kindness made a true difference.  If you want to feel at home abroad, hers is the place to go."

Her apartment in Sodermalm is very conveniently located and wonderfully quiet. Security is excellent and there's even a lift (elevator). Her apartment is quite spacious.  She offered us a lovely, healthy breakfast in a large kitchen, always nicely prepared and presented. The metro stop is a short walk, about 3 blocks away. We really enjoyed Sodermalm's restaurants, interesting old neighborhoods, great vintage shops, and of course the rest of Stockholm was delightful as well. Great little bakery called Tartan (Hornsgatan 32) about a 10 minute walk from Elisabeth's. Outstanding skateboard shop nearby, called Kalihula (I think). Really enjoyed Stockholm, 3 days wasn't nearly enough time."

We arrived pretty late in the evening and she had no problem waiting for us and chatting for a while well past midnight. The room was spacious and welcoming (more lovely than the photos might suggest), with a nice view over Stockholm's coolest neighborhood. Just a few blocks away you'll find hip design shops, delicious cinnamon buns...and the rest of the city is easily walkable. Elisabeth made us feel so welcome, and we spent long mornings enjoying the spectacular breakfast spread she prepared and sharing stories - she has an amazing energy that's easy to get caught up with! A wonderful introduction to Stockholm."

The conversation with her was also nice and our appointment in time to . Nice breakfast aswell .  
Nice located and easy for us to get to the Stockholm fair , where we did exhibit. "
476,206221,74552466,2016-05-15,6161813,Marco,"Staying at Elisabeth's was simply a wonderful experience; she made us feel welcome from the very first until the very last minute of our trip. She's been helpful with tips and info on the city, and a pleasure to talk to.
The apartment is a delight, the room is big, comfortable, absolutely clean; and extremely quiet both at night and during daytime; the breakfast was delicious, and had us not being hungry again until dinner time.
And the neighbourhood as well is awesome. Lots of shops, restaurants, bus and metro stations ""just around the corner"", and the very center of the city easily reachable even by foot, in just about 20 minutes.
I highly recommend staying here!!"
477,206221,76631075,2016-05-28,1847336,Frank,"Elisabeth is one of the best host I have ever met. She is a very kind, warm heated person. She take every step to make us informed and travelled well. Plus she surprised us by serving us the best breakfasts in the morning! Highly recommend:)"

It was an easy walk into the ""Old town"" from her apartment and the local underground station was just a short walk. The accommodation was very comfortable and quiet.

479,206221,82657660,2016-06-28,5924406,Irene,"My friend and I had a great time at Elisabeth's place. The apartment is in a quiet location and the room has a nice cosy feel. We felt very much at home and could come and go as we please. Breakfast in the morning was hearty and consisted of bread, yogurt, meat, cheese, and some fruit. Elisabeth also makes excellent French press coffee!

One thing to note: the showerhead in the bathtub doesn't have a holder or an attachment to the wall (at least in time of writing), so we had to hold it with one hand while showering, but it wasn't a huge concern for us.

Overall, Elisabeth is very warm, friendly, and made us laugh numerous times with her humor. Thank you, Elisabeth, for your hospitality. Staying with you was definitely one of the highlights of our trip! :)"

Elisabeth is a fantastic, lively and amazing host who would recommend you the best walks to get to know the city, not to mention the great lengths she goes to take care of you: we had to leave early and she didn't have the time to prepare us the AMAZING gorgeous breakfast she prepared the first two (Website hidden by Airbnb) she packed some OJ, sandwiches and bananas for the plane. Just astonishing.

Thanks a million Elisabeth, hoep to see you in Tenerife!"
486,206221,153463947,2017-05-21,898502,Bart,"Please add us to the list of those with many kudos for Elisabeth - she's warm, engaging, cultured and will tell you all the best places to visit in stunning Stockholm.  We enjoyed the spacious, quiet bedroom and fantastic breakfasts.  And it was nice to have an elevator.  There's one bathroom with a bath and one of those shower heads on a flexible hose, but it's also spacious and there was never a problem sharing.  The T-bana (Metro) is nearby (0.6 km) but we enjoyed the pretty walk to the Royal Palace (2.2 km) and downtown (2.8 km) areas.  It's an expensive city so check out the lunch specials during the work week and invest in the Stockholm Pass if you like museums (there are many good ones) and boat trips."

Son appartement est situé dans le quartier ""tendance"", assez loin de la pression touristique du centre, tout en étant proche par les transports en commun. 
La chambre  est spacieuse et offre une belle vue sur la verdure de la belle avenue.
Bref une adresse hautement recommandable, un très bon rapport qualité (Website hidden by Airbnb) surtout une belle rencontre !
Merci Elisabeth! "

Excellent! Many restaurants and bars. Very close to the subway station. 

Apartment:
Just wonderful. The bedroom is quaint and the bed is amazingly comfortable. The bathroom is huge and has great lighting. I love Elisabeth's rock and driftwood collection! Our collections would get along. Breakfasts were darling. 

Host: 
Elisabeth is one of those people everyone needs to meet. She is beyond interesting. We learned so much about Stockholm and its people. Thank you!"
490,206221,186743457,2017-08-25,26278013,Anna,"I stayed 3 days in Elisabeth's apartment, and everything was perfect! The room, as the whole apartment, is very beautiful and cozy. The apartment is situated in a very elegant district, which is close to the city center (if you like to walk, it is even possible not to use the metro to get to the city center). There are a lot of fashionable cafes and shops near. There are also some supermarkets nearby. The closest one is a 5 minutes walk.  
I really enjoyed the breakfasts Elisabeth prepared every morning! They were tasty, abundant and even elegantly served on the table! 
It was a pleasure to talk to Elisabeth while having breakfast or in the evening. She is a very nice and interesting person to talk to. She also gave me valuable advice on how to get to some places of interest. 
She treated me so well, so if I am back to Stockholm, I would definitely choose to stay in Elisabeth's apartment again!"

In a few minutes you can get to the metro, the area is full of restaurants, bars and shops, but it is also quiet during night. Elisabeth is a lovely person, very friendly and helpful. She offered us great breakfast every morning and useful tips about the city. We had a wonderful experience, absolutely recommended!"
492,206221,190895857,2017-09-05,77832521,Andrew,"Well, where to begin? Firstly, if you're wanting to stay in Stockholm, please ignore this review and book this place. 

Södermalm is the place to be in Stockholm. Elizabeth's place is a traditionally designed and decorated Swedish apartment. Situated down a beautiful allé, and not far from the T-bana, shops, and restaurants all catering to your needs. No need to even catch the train - you can walk to Gamla Stan (Old Town), Fotografiska, the ferry ports to Djurgården, or even to the city centre.

Need somewhere to go, advice on something, or just up for a chat? Just talk to Elisabeth. She's probably the most caring, funny and down to earth host you could ever meet. Be warned though, you may find yourself spending more time in the apartment than outside! It's that nice. Your experience in Stockholm will be like nothing else.

I can't thank her enough. Even a week was not enough in the most beautiful Scandinavian city. 

And finally, did I mention you should book this place? :-)"
493,206221,194281231,2017-09-16,142374402,Bryce,"I booked accommodation for my mother and her friend with Elisabeth. While I can confidently say that they had an amazing time staying with Elisabeth, this review is from them...

Elisabeth greeted us with a huge smile and lots of energy. She continued to be a happy and fun host for the duration of our week-long stay. The breakfast each morning was fabulous and if we behaved ourselves we were treated with a chocolate =). 

The location was perfect. Right in the middle of Sodermalm, yet down a quiet and very safe feeling street. The train station was only a short walk through the heart of the city.

The room was spacious and comfortable with towels and linen provided.

Thank you very much Elisabeth for making us feel so welcome in your home and city. You made our experience much more fun than staying elsewhere. 

Be sure to comment on the light shade in the kitchen during your stay with Elisabeth and watch her face light up!

We can not recommend Elisabeth and her AirBnB highly enough.

Many thanks,
Linda and Sue"

Our flight times were less than ideal, and Elizabeth was extremely accommodating and woke up in the middle of the night to greet us when we arrived, and left a thoughtful treat for us at the door when we left at 5 in the morning. The bedroom and bathroom had everything we needed, and were very comfortable and cozy. The breakfast each morning was delicious, more than enough to kickstart our days, and with authentic Swedish music in background! Elisabeth and her home are perfect for any couple, solo traveler, or small family looking for a warm and inviting place to stay. I look forward to your potential future visit to the Netherlands Elisabeth! Thanks again for everything!"

The Location - located 5 minutes walk from S:t Eriksplan T-Bana station, 4-5 stops from all major tourist attactions.
Nearby - Try Mellqvist Caffe for one of the best breakfast experience around - they do great breakfast set. Also try Xoko restaurant with innovative cakes and sandwiches, all within less than 5 minutes from the accommodation. For a big splash out, go for steak at AG Restaurant across the bridge in Kungsholmen nearby."

The airport shuttle bus stops at St Eriksplan which is a short walk away. We didn't find it difficult at all getting there with our suitcases.

528,220851,30982761,2015-04-30,6965071,Stefan,"I stayed with Fredric for a month when moving to Stockholm. Fredric offered me a large and bright room with a double bed and ample closed space. My room was facing a spacious and quiet courtyard. Free laundry machines and driers were available in the basement, and Fredric allowed me using the kitchen. The bathroom includes a small, half sized bath tub. It has been a very pleasant time. Fredric’s apartment is in one of the city’s nicest neighbourhoods and very close to Karolinska Insitutet’s Solna Campus, where I spend most time during this stay. As Fredric and I had different work schedules, we often only met briefly. Our interaction was always enjoyable, and Fredric created a great balance between allowing for personal space and offering a sociable atmosphere. Fredric helped me with all of my questions about how to do things in Sweden. I would be happy to stay there again anytime."

Para tomar banho, é preciso habilidades de malabarista, mas a pressão da água é boa. Infelizmente, o apartamento não tem wi-fi, o que torna a vida de um turista um pouco mais difícil. Em geral, foi uma experiência positiva de hospedagem!"

He keeps the apartment clean and tidy.  The bedroom is big and spacious with a comfortable bed.  The best thing about this apartment is the location, it is walking within walking distance to most things and very close to a main T-bana (underground), train line and airport bus stop.

His apartment is in a great spot, very convenient for people working at KI. It is bright with a super comfy bed and has this very calming vibe to it. Fredric gave me lots of helpful advice (cheapest supermarket, best yoga studio) and also let me use his kitchen and washing machine."

There are plenty of cafes and bars in the area, as well as shops for vintage items and home decor. Fredric was very non-intrusive and friendly, always accommodating us as best he could. While we didn't spend that much time together (we were only in Stockholm for the Eurovision Song Contest) Fredric gave us good tips on the area and communicated with us well both before and during our trip. The room is spacious, bright, and the bed is incredibly comfortable. The room perhaps becomes a little light in the morning as there are only blinds over the windows - that's our only real criticism. Otherwise, a great, calm stay in an apartment with a really minimalist, soothing atmosphere."

539,220851,79547301,2016-06-13,56078562,Ikí,"Fredric's home deserves nice than words, it needs to be experienced on its own. It is a beautiful apartment, full of light, minimalistic, clean, and with everything you could need ranging from kitchen amenities to washing machine. Located in the heart of Birkastan, a neighborhood that is charismatic and vibrating with life, although peaceful, safe and quiet during the night. Fredric was super responsive throughout the whole stay and I could not recommend this place more. Genuinely special. "
540,220851,97319886,2016-08-26,30673937,Kazzy,"Fredric is a friendly, responsive and generous host. He always offers me tips to make my stay easier and it was such a pleasure talking with him. The apartment is beautiful, clean and minimalistic. There are most of the standard equipment there. The room is spacious, bright and the bed is comfortable too. The location is also very good: metro station, supermarkets, bakery shop, restaurants etc all in 5 mins walking distance, 10mins metro ride to the center of the city. I really recommend this place!"

The train station is really close by. Plenty of shops and wifi places near. Also great food places very close by. The only problem I had is that there wasn't wifi. For Americans that can be a problem because my phone didn't work without wifi.

Lidia gave me the double room as it was available which was perfect, but this single room looked just as good. Tasty, filling breakfast. Wifi worked great too. I would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a base to explore Stockholm"
563,242188,944467,2012-02-23,1746523,Anke,Thanks to Lidia I had a wonderful stay in Stockholm. She is very kind and helpful and her appartment is conveniently located. I definitly recommend to stay with her.

566,242188,1266971,2012-05-12,2131857,Teona,"Lidia's apartment is perfectly located, central and at the same time in quite district, everything what tourist might need is close by. Apartment is clean, neat and cosy. Bed is fantastic....But the main beauty of this apartment is its hostess - Lidia. She is amazing, wonderful and welcoming lady who tells you much more than is written in any book or web about Stockholm and Sweden in general.

I 100% recommend Lidia's B&B, as missing this opportunity to get to know Lidia means that you've just passed by the Stockholm.

P.S. Her breakfasts are just separate phenomenon, that shouldn't be missed. "
567,242188,1304824,2012-05-19,2182133,Bree,Great location & easy to use public transportation. Very clean & quiet space to stay in. Lidia met me for arrival & explained everything on her map of Stockholm over a cup of tea. Thanks.
568,242188,1386109,2012-05-30,2446996,Ken,From the moment I met Lidia she made me feel very welcome to stay in her comfortable home. I tend to stay to myself and this is a real change for me to stay in someones home. I have been in Sweden for over a month and I have never had a better sleep than what I had at Lidias.  She cannot seem to do enough for you. I have already passed her name along to a colleage of mine who frequently has people coming to Sweden on business. When you stay at Lidias you would be remissed to not take advantaged of her breakfast.
569,242188,1423161,2012-06-05,2223112,Anthony,"Lidia was an exceptional host and my stay was made extremely comfortable. Lidia was very accommodating even though I arrived late, and she even fed me a snack because all the stores were closed! The location of the apartment is superb, and I could not have asked for a better experience with this host. Conversations amongst tea and coffee were always pleasant! Thank you Lidia!"
570,242188,1479816,2012-06-14,2340667,Danielle,"I spent 5 wonderful days in Stockholm, staying at Lidia's! She's a great host, very welcoming and friendly. She gave me a lot of useful information about Stockholm, what to see and what to, when to go and how to get there. And she prepares an excellent breakfast !  I loved our chats over breakfast and in the evening, it really added this little extra to my holiday. Recommended !
"

573,242188,1662560,2012-07-09,2088524,Carol,"I thoroughly enjoyed my short time in Stockholm and the great acccommodation provided by Lidia contributed massively to this. Her flat is comfortable, in a superb location and her breakfasts lived up to all the rave reviews I had read. (The breakfast chats were also enjoyable). Lidia is extremely welcoming, and keen for you to have the best experience of this wonderful city. I am an independent type of traveller and the best thing about staying with Lidia is that she is really attentative but not in the least intrusive - just the perfect mix. Can't recommend it enough. Thank you Lidia."
574,242188,1966649,2012-08-13,2440946,Woosang,"Comfortable house and warmhearted host! I could enjoy running along Sodermalm seaside, visiting Gamlastan on foot, shopping at SoFo and drinking at various pubs during my one month stay. "
575,242188,2052424,2012-08-21,787427,James,"Lidia is a very cool host. Her place is very well located and comfortable. Very nice to talk to her about her life experiences. I highly recommend having her breakfasts. She sets out quite a spread for only 50 Krowns. It is a great way to start the morning. Make sure you follow her instructions on taking the J to her apartment and you will be set finding her. The bed was really comfortable . Especially after sleeping on Russian ferrys. I plan on coming back to Stockholm next summer and will definitely be asking Lidia if she has a room for me.

576,242188,2088114,2012-08-25,2348828,Danielle,"Site bien situé: à 15 minutes à pied de la ""Vie à Stockholm"", à 5 min. du métro et du train de banlieue. Accueil privilégié par une dame qui est très généreuse avec ses invités. On ne manque de rien chez Lidia, au contraire! L'organisation de l'appartement est parfait pour se reposer; endroit très tranquille, déjeuner copieux. Lidia nous fournit toutes les informations nécessaires pour un séjour optimal (5 jours dans mon cas). Je recommande ce site, à moins que vous vouliez être encore plus près des activités au centre de Stockholm.

581,242188,2454065,2012-09-30,3233970,Mohini,"I had a very pleasant stay at Lidia's and would recommend it to anyone.  Lidia is very welcoming, anticipates your needs, gives you the right amount of privacy, is very well-travelled and knowledgeable, and gives great tips on getting around the city.  Her home is located in a fairly central neighbourhood, a 5-10 minute easy walk from the metro and commuter trains. The area is bustling in the evenings, with lots of restaurants and bars.  The old town is a 15 minute walk away. The room was clean and quiet, and the bed very comfortable.  I got back very late each night and that's not a problem as long as you are respectful of the other guests and don't make any noise. Walking back late at night was also completely safe. There are 3-4 rooms located off the first floor landing, including a bathroom which everyone shares and which is very clean. There are shared tea/coffee making facilities and Lidia was very accommodating in providing me with the use of an iron and ironing board.  Breakfast is very generous. Overall, a great B&B."
582,242188,2656418,2012-10-19,2884012,Lina,Lidia was a very kind and friendly person. The house is well located therefore I highly recommend it. Breakfast was yummy.

The room is very close to the station and lots of things in that area of Stockholm. I would highly recommend this listing to anyone wanting to stay in Stockholm. 
585,242188,3513702,2013-02-11,4156607,Verena,"I stayed at Lidia's neat and tidy place for a month and I enjoyed it. Lidia is a warm and welcoming person. She is very helpful in giving precious advice on things to do and anything you may need while you stay in Stockholm. The flat is in a convenient location, just a few minutes walk from Södra station. I would definitely recommend this flat to anyone wanting to stay in Stockholm. "
586,242188,4297662,2013-04-25,6030190,Phoebe,"I thought this was great! Lidia was very sweet and helpful, while also respectful of privacy, etc. House, bed, and bathroom were all very clean and comfortable, especially compared to some other European hotels of similar price range! Wifi worked like a charm. Location is good too-- I walked pretty much everywhere (and I mean everywhere), but it was also easy to hop on the train or a bus."
587,242188,4513778,2013-05-10,4265835,Elfa,Lidia es muy amable... Te ayuda con tips... Todo esta muy limpio.

The room is spacious with a big window and very clean, you can find all the things you need! Although it was a shared-bathroom I had no problem at all!

590,242188,5167811,2013-06-16,6690168,Dana,"Lidia was really wonderful.  She was very helpful telling me about good things to see in Stockholm and giving me tips on how to save some money.  Her directions from the airport to her house were very good.  Her apartment is easy to get to from the airport.  You get on a commuter train and the stop is a five minute walk to her apartment.  After my check-out time was past, she really showed her true colors helping me above and beyond the call of duty.  I am most appreciative for her help at that time.  Her apartment is perfectly set up for guests with rooms on a second floor.  I highly recommend Lidia!"

Upon arrival, she offered me coffee, a map and some wonderful information on places to visit and things to see.  The bedrooms are on the 2nd floor of the duplex that also has a separate bathroom and seating room.  Lidia pretty much stays on the 1st floor and I had the privacy of the 2nd floor to myself.  

I highly recommend Lidia's apartment and I plan on coming back with my friends to stay with her."
593,242188,6226633,2013-08-04,6822888,Carolina,"The stay at Lidia's was most comfortable. The street and area in general are very quiet and friendly for walking around. The location is perfect from commuter train, also from subway although slightly further.There are some buses around the corner but I did not use them.
The flat itself is spacious and luminous, very clean and with all commodities well set up. I stayed in a single room which provided an extremely cozy bed and direct sunlight in the morning. Storage space was also more than sufficient. The bathroom is very spacious and clean too. .
The fact that the guest rooms are one floor above from homeowner gives a good sense of privacy. Besides, each room comes with a key to have it locked. Still, meeting Lidia in the kitchen is a wonderful time to spend, she is most helpful and knowledgeable when it comes to transport, visiting the city and touring around. She really is a wonderful host, I will definitely keep her in my list when I visit Stockholm next time. Thank you Lidia for all your kind help!"

I felt pretty much at home, Lidia made me feel immediately welcomed, helped me with asertive suggestions of ways and places ti visit, her daily opinions helped me to make the best of my time in this fantastic city.  Her breakfast was delicious, in a cozy luminious table, with everything so esquisitely arranged and presented.  i can still taste those crunchy croissants, perfect way to start a busy day!!! Those tastybcheeses, hams and salamis!!! Fruit, eggs, everything!! Thank you Lidia!!!

Transportation is convenient, the flat has a great view, decently sized rooms, plenty of other space and good amenities. Lidia is an excellent host: super friendly, very keen on making sure her guests feel instantly at home...somehow there always seems to have a cup of coffee or tea ready :) So thanks for the great time, I do plan to be back and I recommend very much to anybody intending to travel to STO to see if there's a room available at Lidia's."

608,242188,15100037,2014-07-02,15659495,Melissa,"I really enjoyed my stay with Lidia. She welcomed me at the door with tea and kanelbulle (cinnamon buns) and gave me an overview of the area, pointing out her favourite things to see. For an extra 50kronor Lidia can provide breakfast (and conversation). The area around Lidia's flat is quiet and safe but very close to central Sodermalm's bars and restaurants. It's an easy walk to Gamla Stan with some fine views on the way.

609,242188,15595524,2014-07-12,17135237,Eeva-Maria,"Staying at Lidia´s was my first Airbnb experience and I could´t be more happy. The neighborhood was nice, Lidia´s house very peaceful and good location and room was clean and comfortable. Lidia was very helpful with telling, where to find everything and where to go. I´d definitely recommend her place to anyone. "
610,242188,16530332,2014-07-28,17301491,Mike,"Lidia was an amazing host! Very nice and friendly, passionate about Stockholm and travelling and full of great ideas of things to see and do. The place feels like home as soon as you get there. I'd love to go back soon."
611,242188,22177372,2014-11-01,13629363,Daniel,"Lidia was a great host. My stay of 3 months while doing a PhD stay at KTH University was great. Conveniently located in Södermalm, has a few grocery stores nearby, Södra station 1 min. walking distance, less than 10 min. to red line metro station, quiet neighbourhood, and most importantly, a really nice house. I highly recommend staying at Lidia's house. You will receive any help you need to move around the city and valuable indications about landmarks."
612,242188,22950937,2014-11-18,22080762,Bamboi,"I had a very nice welcoming staying at Lidia's. I pretty much felt like home. I Liked very much the room and the bed. 
Got all the info I need from Lidia about the Stockholm and the area we were located at. I took my about 2 hours to get to know the city. 
I enjoyed very much my vacation there and I sure recommend the place to others. 
Thanks Lidia one more time for everything. "
613,242188,26256763,2015-02-08,25786741,Jon,"The apartment is located in a quiet part of Södermalm and very accessible to the public transport, near to the train and metro, but also near to Sofo, the area of this island full of restaurants and good atmosphere.
Lidia prepared us nices breakfasts in the morning and gave us great tips for visiting. She was pleasant, well informed about Stockholm and talkative in general culture, so we had really good conversations.
Very comfortable accommodations, with a nice common room for the guests. Highly recommended. I felt like home and enjoyed the city a lot. Thanks!

616,242188,32511363,2015-05-19,28887156,Oliver,"I had a wonderful stay at Ms. Lidia's place.  Lidia is a very welcoming and gracious host.  She provides great travel tips if you are visiting Stockholm as a tourist.  Her apartment is located in a convenient location, close to two metro lines.  There are a few rooms, like a small bed & breakfast.  I took the smallest room, which is perfect for a solo traveller.  There are also double rooms available.  I would definitely stay here again on my next visit to Stockholm."
617,242188,33576900,2015-05-30,10091467,Astrid,"I stayed two weeks in May in Lydia's airB&B when I was in Stockholm for work. The description was accurate. I stayed in the single room. It is a small room but it was perfect for me. There is also a common room with a little fridge that you can use. The air b&b is really close (2 min walk) to the train station (Stockholm Södra). That was perfect for my work, but it gets you in 2 min in Stockholm central. There are also several grocery shops closeby. When I stayed at Lydias place, several guest came and went. But everyone was very considerate to each other in sharing common place and bathroom and the atmosphere was really pleasant. Most of all, Lydia is very welcoming and very caring host! She had the patience also to have little Swedish conversations with me, and helping me in learning Swedish. When I arrived there was an internet connection problem, but she arranged immediately a way I could still have internet acces. She has also very good knowledge about the sight-seeing places in Stockholm and all the practical arrangments. No doubt I would recommend her and go back!  "
618,242188,34472972,2015-06-08,29483133,Leonard,"Lidia has been an extremely wonderful host. Very polite, friendly and gives a very warm welcome when you arrive. Details provided to the address was more than sufficient in navigating to the apartment. Apartment has a very cozy feeling and the room directly faces an open park with a good view of the outside and plenty of ventilation. Apartment is also located close to some of the neighbourhood's most beautiful viewing points of Stockholm up at Mariatorget. If you are intending to visit Stockholm and want somewhere nice and cozy to stay in Sodermalm, do consider staying with Lidia!"
619,242188,36653216,2015-06-30,27220846,Fabian,"todo bien, Lidia fue una excelente anfitrion, muy generosa y gentil, muy buenos sus desayunos, ademas muy buena ubicacion del departamento y habitacion en un barrio muy tranquilo y hermoso. lo recomiendo 100%. "
620,242188,36986792,2015-07-03,3877726,Grace,Lydia was a wonderful host; she helped me understand the neighborhood and the best way to spend my short amount of time in Stockholm. It felt just like home! She was even kind enough to make me a delicious breakfast for 50 Kronos each day which filled me up for my adventures.
621,242188,37644322,2015-07-09,29249764,Isabel,Lidia was caring and solicitous of my needs. I enjoyed my chats with her. The bed was possibly the most comfortable I've slept on during my four week trip. The location was very handy. I'd recommend a stay at Lidia's to anyone.
622,242188,38171638,2015-07-13,31878236,Nimmi,"I absolutely enjoyed staying at Lidia's place. She was very helpful with directions to her place. Once I reached her place, she had maps marked with interesting stuff for me.

Her place is very nice and clean and located closed to train and bus stops. 

Lidia is a very sweet and pleasant person."
623,242188,38625402,2015-07-17,18426026,Xi,"Perfact location,very close to a train station,grocery store,a square with bars and restaurants, and the metro station,too. Lidia's house is very lovely and the room I stayed is quite comfortable. And the thing impressed me most is that Lidia and her relatives are all so nice!"
624,242188,40211155,2015-07-29,33218517,Rosa,"Lidia is a fantastic host. She helps you solve anything you may need. The room is great, very luminous because of the huge window it has. Moreover the views are amazing. Everything is clean and comfortable. If I came back to Stockholm, i would definately stay here again. Location is great too."
625,242188,40836529,2015-08-02,13127945,Alejandra,"Lidia was a most welcoming host. I felt at home right away. She was full of information and good advice.  Her apartment is big, whith all the ammenities necessary and full of light. It is in a great location, close to restaurants and public transportation to everywhere in town."
626,242188,41928283,2015-08-10,24781582,Manuel & Kees (Cornelis),"Lidia was very welcoming. She welcomed me with coffee and gave me lots of important information and I really appreciated her help.
Thanks Lidia."
627,242188,43618078,2015-08-21,34251543,Anke,It was a nice stay at Lidias place. I can highly recommend it. She was friendly and welcoming and helped were she can.

629,242188,44611346,2015-08-27,7414627,Louise,"Lidia was an amazing host, very helpful with information, what is the easiest, what is the cheapest. Always there for you, but never intrusive, I Will definitely recommend! :)"
630,242188,44897370,2015-08-30,33801158,Elisabeth,"The room was as good as I had expected and Lidia as nice as I had hoped. The location is great, it is very easy to get into town, only a few minutes away from public transport and close enough to the center to walk there. It is quiet at night and I felt like coming home after long days walking around Stockholm. 
Having read previous reviews, I also decided to book breakfast which was a good idea.
It was my first airbnb-experience but hopefully not my last and should I come back to Stockholm, I am sure to try and stay with Lidia again. It is great to be able to travel this way as a 60+ person and also great to have a 60+ host as welcoming and interesting as Lidia. Thanks a lot, Lidia."
631,242188,45304298,2015-09-01,19253859,Chris,"Lidia was a very good host and nice lady.  She sent explicit and detailed directions on how to get to her apartment.  She was also waiting for me upon my arrival direct from SFO, which was very welcoming.  

The room is small but very clean as is the entire apartment and bathroom.   There is a basic desk, nightstand and single bed.   The bathroom is shared with other guests.   

There were kids playing outside and I had to leave the window open for air so you can hear them playing but the neighborhood is very suburban and quiet with very few cars around.  It was very peaceful and serene.  

It is a 5-10 minute walk to any food or restaurant so there's no much immediately below the complex but the train is closely.

Lidia spent a lot of time to give me tips on where to go and what to see in Stockholm.  She answered all my questions and was a great host.  She looked after me with times that my train was leaving the next morning and provided anything I asked for (i.e. adapter).  "
632,242188,45599868,2015-09-04,19005461,Karandeep (KD),"I had a swell time at Lidia's place.  The neighborhood she lives in is excellent and downtown Stockholm is only one train station away.  Lidia is an awesome host -  very welcoming and very helpful.  For instance on my last day I had to take a train to the airport and had gone out for a bit to check out the neighborhood. When I came back Lidia had a small slip of paper listing the available train times and the connecting bus times and the bus number that I would need.  On my first day Lidia helped me with sight seeing trips given my time constraints.  The room is quite comfortable for a single person and has a nice bed.  The bathroom is a shared one.

Given another chance I would definitely stay at Lidia's place."
633,242188,46618008,2015-09-12,17613139,Michael,"Lidia hat mir eine sehr detaillierte Beschreibung geschickt wie ich zu Ihr komme. Die Lage ist wunderbar zentral und alles ist gut zu erreichen. Zum Flughafen kann man direkt durchfahren. Sie war sehr flexibel was die Schlüsselübergabe anging. Ich war sehr in Eile und kam erst später als gedacht zum Einchecken. Das stelle kein Problem da. Sie war sehr hilfsbereit und nett. Schade, dass ich so wenig Zeit hatte. Ich muss halt wiederkommen! "
634,242188,47043458,2015-09-15,37572400,Amanda,"This was a great place to stay -- the pictures and descriptions are accurate.  I took an overnight flight to Stockholm & Lidia was kind enough to let me in to drop off my luggage in the morning, which was wonderful.  The SL train stop near her place is on the same line as Arlanda airport, which made it very easy to get to & her directions from the train stop to the apartment made the place very easy to find."
635,242188,47311337,2015-09-17,22175879,Andrew,"I don't have enough space to leave an adequate  review for Lidia and her place. To begin with, Lidia was waiting at the front door to the building when I arrived despite only having an estimate for when I might be there.  She had tea and snacks waiting after I settled into my room and mapped out various spots in the city to explore.  Lidia was responsive without being intrusive and she even went out of her way to help me with laundry in the basement while I was out. In terms of the space, it was perfect for my quick stop in Stockholm, only a few blocks from the train to the airport and close to the action on Gotgagan street and in Old Town.   My room was clean along with the shared bathroom, and there was very little noise at night.  I would recommend this unit to anyone who wants an authentic Stockholm experience at a reasonable price. Thanks again Lidia."
636,242188,47470360,2015-09-19,37853399,Martin,Ett varmt välkomnande. Visade runt på ett mycket bra sätt. Rent och fräscht med bra frukost. Trevliga samtal. 
637,242188,48319206,2015-09-25,43564086,Elga,"First of all want to say that I  couldn't really believe in comments here until I saw it with my eyes and thank you all lovely people here for honest reviews ! 
 The room looked like exactly the way it looks like on the pictures!  Everything was very tidy, clean, very nice atmosphere and quiet. No motorbike noises by night from the street  ( was very important to me.. ) One has really  everything for relaxing there. The area the apartment is located in is very close to the city center and has  very good access to the public transport. 
Lidia is an amazing host, she was very helpful and gave me a very detailed explanation of the way to her apartment,so I could get there very easily.
I must mention I still got free coffee,tee ect. even though I did not order breakfest !
I would very much recommend her place for staying in Stockholm if you're on holidays or even for your business trip on a budget."
638,242188,48716613,2015-09-28,24698651,Bengt And Karin,Ett mycket trevligt bemötande från värden Lidia bidrog till att min vistelse i Stockholm blev minnesvärd och lyckad. Jag kan varmt rekommendera detta boende som ligger i ett centralt läge på Södermalm..
639,242188,49336926,2015-10-03,5689973,Barbara,"This place worked out well. It was about 5 minutes from the commuter train (handy for coming from main train station in Stockholm) and 10 to 15 minutes to the Metro (a bus stop was closer if you preferred.) It's also about 15 minutes to walk to SoFo, Stockholm's hipster area, if you like trendy restaurants etc. There is also a street that is closed to traffic that has fashion clothing stores like Gina Tricot (similar to H&M), about 15 to 20 minutes walking distance.

The room was small but cozy and comfortable. There are other rooms so you will meet other guests and hear their them in the shared common area but overall that wasn't an issue. 

Lidia was very helpful with maps and suggestions of things to do, and tips about public transit. "
640,242188,49598434,2015-10-05,37869951,Melanie,"I felt very welcome when I arrive at Lidia's. She kindly offered me a cup of tea and explained me about the area and the main tourist attractions in Stockholm. The room was cosy and had a nice view on the city, perfect for a weekend! The flat itself is very well located with train station 3 min away and other metro station 5-10 min away and at a walkable distance to cafes, bars and Slussen. "
641,242188,49980337,2015-10-08,26075869,Fred,"I arrived late from my flight and local train to her neighborhood but Lidia was waiting for me at midnight. Her instructions on getting to the apartment from airport was very clear and I had no problems. The neighborhood was very nice with many cafes, restaurants and grocery stores.  It was situated near public transportation and located to all the places I wanted to see.  She helped me with some recommendations, the cost and how to get there. The description of the room was exactly  told and the photos were exact.  I just needed a simple bedroom, clean and quiet and that was what I got. She was very kind to me."
642,242188,50661184,2015-10-13,7878388,Judit,"I spent 4 nights in a cozy room in an apartment situated very closely to Central Stockholm. What I appreciate the most and what I was looking for when choosing Airbnb was that I did not just stay there as a tourist but that I had the occasion to interaction with my host, Mrs. Kuhn, and have some nice cultural exchange as well.  The real apartment and the listing match 100%."
643,242188,51081222,2015-10-17,2590110,Erika,"Lidia kindly met me at the door (even though my arrival time was a moving target), and helped me with my luggage. What's more, after a long drive, she served me tea and dinner. I tried to return the favor with a cake from a local bakery, and we spent an evening in heartfelt discussion. I feel lucky to have stayed here, and the other guests were kind too. "
644,242188,51443853,2015-10-20,17638407,Craig,"The room was comfortable with a good view, and Lidia was extremely friendly, welcoming, and helpful with ideas for what to see and do around Stockholm. I'd definitely stay again!"
645,242188,51713606,2015-10-24,41974675,Isabelle,"Lidia is a most welcoming host, full of useful and interesting information about things to see round Stockholm. The accomodation is as described, comfortable, warm, very practical. The situation is perfect for visiting Gamla Stan and the surrounding areas, everything is within walking distance, and for those who prefer public transfer, the train station and bus stations are just round the corner. Also most appreciable is the free wifi connection, kettle, tea, coffee, fridge and microwave. "
646,242188,52493734,2015-10-30,13502321,Xue Peng,"Lidia is one of the most welcoming host I ever met via airbnb. She woke up early to wait for me as my flight was supposed to arrive early morning. When I arrived, she served me tea and shared with me tips and advices on where to visit, provided me with brochures and maps to assist. 

The location and accommodation was same as described - Nice cozy room in a central location. The apartment is clean, and neighbourhood is safe enough to walk in the streets at night. 

I stayed at Lidia's place for 5 nights, and often we find ourselves engaging in hour long conversations around many topics, ranging from travel to politics. 

Thank you for the interesting conversations and hospitality during my stay."
647,242188,53110570,2015-11-05,8188703,Adia,Lidia welcomed me and I found her home to be nice and peaceful. And it's in a great location.

The location is good. It is close to old town & had work distance to metro stations. The room is quiet & have good view of city. I am very happy for my stay there.

The flat is close to bus stops and train stops and is one stop away from central station. It is about a 45 min ride to and from Arlanda airport.

Sie war sehr nett und hilfsbereit, die Beschreibung zur Wohnung war einwandfrei, der Austausch zuvor sehr informativ. Die Lage der Wohnung ist wunderbar im schönen Süden Stockholms. Darüber hinaus hatte ich mit Lidia sehr nette Gespräche, das Zimmer war einwandfrei. So reist man gerne.

The neighbourhood is well connected and a 5min walk to all the hip places of Södermalm. I stayed in the single room, in which I felt very cozy and at home. Seeing it being all cold and snowy outside it was hard to leave the room, but you can easily cuddle up here with a book and a cup of tea if thats what you feel like :)

668,242188,63105537,2016-02-20,55596992,Cate,"I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. Lidia was an amazing host, and has a beautiful home. As soon as I arrived, she helped me to figure out where I was going and what I wanted to do. She was friendly and kind, and was always ready to help in any way possible. And the breakfasts were delicious!  She was also located in a very convenient part of Stockholm, easily accessible to the majority of the city. I would recommend staying with Lidia to anyone! "

The room was very good and excellently equipped. The bathroom is great and very clean. The apartment is very neat and nicely decorated. The closest commuter train station is minutes away, while the closest metro station is about 10 minutes away on foot. The location is quiet, but close to the center of Södermalm."

679,242188,74570957,2016-05-15,3082001,Marianne,"I stayed 6 days at Lidias in May 2016. Actually I did´t get the single room that was shown in the advertisement even if I booked the room about 9 months ago.  But it didn´t matter. It mattered more that Lidia was so kind and helpful. She gave me a lot of information and good suggestions how to come around in Stockholm. As my cable for to charge my mobil phone didn´t work she borrowed me her cable for the time I stayed there. So I was able to take the photos and keep in contact with my family and friends. I was even able to practise my swedish with her. She was really a patient person to listen to me and to talk swedish with me even if I did not speak it so well. She had during my visit also some other guests staying there and they were also very nice. I enjoeyd the conversation with Lidia and her guests. It was so nice to stay in her flat,  I feld like home! I recommend Lidia and her flat for everybody who would stay a while in Stockholm.   "
680,242188,75178311,2016-05-19,2274213,Devesh,"Lidia was a terrific host. She provided excellent directions to her place from the airport, including options for the fastest vs cheapest routes. After getting to her place, she made coffee and croissants, and oriented me with the neighborhood and Stockholm. The room was clean, cozy and had a lovely view. She was great communicating and just a pleasure to deal with. I heartily recommend Lidia, and will definitely stay at her place again on my next visit to Stockholm!"

The metro station is a 5 minute walk away.  Lydia's apartment is clean and very comfortable. The bedroom is on the top floor with nice views, comfortable bed and adequate space along with a sitting room with coffee maker and small fridge.  Lydia is happy to answer questions and give advice about Stockholm."
687,242188,83194445,2016-07-01,20207238,Mari,"Lidia is amazingly great host! She helped me a lot, charming and also tolerant of the other culture.
I had stayed here for more than 3 weeks and spent many hours with her and talked a lot.
Fridge, kettle, coffee…everything you need for travel is here. And Lidia allowed me to use laundry too.
The location is perfect for sightseeing in Stockholm. It’s very convenience to get to the center of Stockholm and also SOFO area. But so quiet.
Close to the subway station and bus station, too. There are many nice cafes around here.
I came to Stockholm for studying Swedish, the room was so comfortable to study. And she also taught me Swedish! Tack så mycket, Lidia!
場所もとても便利で､Lidiaも最高にすてき 克つ ﾌﾟﾛ意識の高いﾎｽﾄです｡強くｵｽｽﾒします!"
688,242188,86149260,2016-07-15,504861,Ryan,"Lidia is a wonderful host! Her apartment is very centrally located, clean, and just beautiful. She helped me plan my trip, gave me maps and information, and was always available if I had questions. I couldn't recommend staying here more!

The apartment itself is in the cool/trendy Sodermalm neighborhood, but in a very quiet residential area. It's only a 5 minute walk to a main train station, and a 5-10 minute walk to the subways and lots of restaurants. It is really the absolute best location to stay to see Stockholm, from what I could tell from my short stay there.

Thanks, Lidia, for making my short trip to Stockholm so great!"
689,242188,90653032,2016-08-01,46691206,Chris,"Lidia's place was great. Well located.

690,242188,91220388,2016-08-04,12887725,William,"Lidia is a lovely host - she very kindly let me check in early in the morning as I had come in on am overnight train. She also took the time to sit down with me and give me an overview of the city, how to get around and what to see while i was there, which was really useful. The apartment is really easy to get to from central station and there airport (there's a commuter line station just round the corner), and its also close to a couple of metro lines for getting round the city"
691,242188,92078066,2016-08-07,47961287,Yang Yang,"Lidia is super nice. I arrived late in the night but Lidia was waiting for me. check in and check out is quite easy and location is nice which takes you only 15 mins to the downtown by train. Single room is small but it is nice for one person to stay in short period. Besides, the shared bathroom and living space is quite good. Overall, i would highly recommend!"
692,242188,94641936,2016-08-16,6773572,Laura,"I spent 4 lovely and relaxing nights in Lidia's single room. 

The rooms are located on the upper level of her 2-story apartment. There is one single room and 2 double rooms. There is one bathroom for all three rooms. There are locks on all the doors and a common area equipped with a mini-fridge, hot water heater, eating utensils and a microwave. Great wifi and quite clean.   Had no problem with the other guests and with sharing a bathroom. Great experience. 

Room: cozy and cute. I didn't spend much time there so the size of the room did not bother me at all. Lidia was great and made sure the trash was emptied every day. I had enough towels, a water glass and she even made my bed. :). There is a desk in the room with 2 lamps along with an overhead lamp. The room faces a playground area/park so sometimes you will hear kids playing soccer but it was not a problem for me. It does get plenty of light (I actually had sunshine during my trip to Stockholm) so it made me wish I had brought my eye mask.  

Location: Great location. Public transportation (T-bana & bus stops) around the corner. Near yummy bakeries and delicious coffee houses. I had an early morning cruise on the Viking Line. It was an easy 30-min walk to their harbor. She lives on the 5th floor of her building but there is a great elevator. 

Lidia is a great host and she wants to be a resource to her guests. She gave me great directions to her apartment from Arlanda. Once I arrived, we had coffee and she talked to me about Stockholm and all that it has to offer. She was very kind and you can tell she enjoy hosting us tourists. It was nice to come home to a friendly face -- she even remembered some of my random Stockholm travel plans!  Thank you, Lidia. "
693,242188,97096905,2016-08-25,24741850,Diana,"Lidia was a magnificent host. She replied to all my questions immediately and 1 week before arrival time, she sent me the perfect instructions on getting to her home. We took the train directly from the airport to her Stockholm Sodra stop, it was perfect and easy. It took a little less than an hour. If you have any questions about the trains at the airport, at Terminal 4 there is an information center - you can also buy the train ticket there. We bought a 7 day travel card because we were there 9 days - we used it good. There is an additional 85 Kr (~$10) fee to get on this commuter train from the airport but it was worth it.

My parents joined me on my trip. I got the single room and my parents got one of the double rooms. I didn't know there were 2 double rooms, the other one has 2 separate twin beds. All 3 rooms share the bathroom. At first, I thought this would be a problem but it never was.

My single room was spacious enough and faced the playground. Noise-wise, you can hear the kids playing, no biggie, noise doesn't start till 8 am. At night time, you hear the people talking but it stops around 11-11:30 pm, no later.

I really loved the neighborhood. If I ever go back, I'd stay in that area again. It was accessible to everything. The buses and trains were all nearby. So are the restaurants and parks. You  can walk to Gamla Stan if you want to check out the area - about 1.5 miles from her home. I felt safe at all times. Lidia's suggestions/guidance was very helpful and valuable. She's very nice and you can tell she enjoys being a host. My parents really enjoyed her company too, especially during breakfast. My parents wanted breakfast every morning so they paid to get it. She offered bread, cheeses, prosciutto, ham, fruits, jam and more. I provided my own breakfast since I have a sensitive stomach.

Lidia is very enjoyable and easy to speak with. I highly recommend her."
694,242188,98021560,2016-08-29,76850236,Haruka,"Her hospitality was perfect!!
She was always kind for me:)
And she told me how to go the sightseeing sight or some Swedish words! It was soooo interesting to chat her:) Also her breakfast was delicious! I was glad to meet and talk her! If I have a chance, I wanna stay here again!!!!!

Thanks! Tack! Arigatou! "

She made me feel right at home and is very sweet. She was kind enough to sit down with me when I arrived and walked me through ways to get around the city and main spits to check out. Her place was in a perfect location and was comfortable and clean. I think you'll appreciate Lidi's cheery disposition and her great apartment, if you stay with her.

It's insanely easy to find, right next to the commuter train station, which you can reach directly from Arlanda. She also sent me perfectly clear directions.

No primeiro contato, conversamos durante uma hora e ela me explicou bem sobre as atrações da cidade e as direções que deveria tomar. Muito paciente, uma pessoa gentil e amável, e que fez tudo para que eu sentisse em casa. Mais do que recomendado uma estadia em sua casa. Quando eu regressar à Estocolmo, certamente vou querer me hospedar em sua casa novamente. Obrigado por tudo Lídia. "
737,242188,156999770,2017-06-02,77095725,Maria,"The room and washroom were both very clean and the location was absolutely central, plus Lidia was a fantastic host always willing to help. I had a great time here and would definitely recommend Lidia's place!"

Lidia is wonderful and incredibly helpful. She gave me excellent directions for arriving from the airport (including different options) and great recommendations for my stay in Stockholm. The room and common areas were very clean. I had a very enjoyable stay at Lidia's and would definitely stay there again should I find myself back in Stockholm. 
739,242188,160420600,2017-06-14,104738381,Monique,"The accomodation was just like it was depocted in the pictures. Basic but very clean, confrtable and eveything you could need. Li is so helpful with maps and advice. Such a great base to explore the city. "
740,242188,161463251,2017-06-18,118316460,Nataly,Lidia is very kind and gave me a lot tips about what to do in Stockholm. She provided me with a map and a lot information material about the city. She also sended a detailed description how to get to her appartement.
741,242188,162974467,2017-06-23,41269104,Mary,Li is great! Helped me with suggestions of stuff to do and navigating around Stockholm. Her place was just what I was looking for. It's down a side street so fairly quiet but also right by a very fun neighborhood and near a couple metro stops. Would highly recommend!
742,242188,165524380,2017-07-01,126378133,Mike,"Nice, quiet location and Lidia was extremely helpful. Thank you Lidia!"
743,242188,166269383,2017-07-03,49573165,Corey,I had a great experience at Li's home. I can understand why she is a superhost. She let me know on on my way in that the commuter train was out of service and gave me an alternative route to get to her home. She also went over places for me to go in Stockholm. The room of course was in great condition and in a quiet neighborhood. I had the privilege of sitting down and talking with Li and a family member during my stay which just added to an already memorable experience in Stockholm. Would definitely recommend Li's home to anyone travelling to Stockholm.
744,242188,168207960,2017-07-09,55073841,María José,"Lidia, la anfitriona, me facilitó información detalladísima sobre cómo llegar desde el aeropuerto al apartamento, e incluso me estaba esperando en la puerta por temor a que no lo encontrara y pasara de largo. Me recibió con un té y mapas para facilitarme cualquier información sobre transportes, museos,   etc. que necesitara. El día de mi partida había alteraciones en el servicio ferroviario y también me ayudó a encontrar la mejor combinación para llegar al aeropuerto. 

El apartamento está muy bien ubicado cerca de varias estaciones de metro y paradas de autobús, muy cerca del centro histórico, a donde se puede llegar caminando o con el metro (a una estación de distancia).

El apartamento es silencioso, luminoso y amplio, y dispone de todo lo necesario para comer allí con comodidad (nevera, calentador de agua, utensilios de mesa, etc.). También hay varios supermercados cercanos donde se puede comprar comida.

Si vuelvo a Estocolmo, me gustaría volver a alojarme aquí sin ninguna duda."
745,242188,169689407,2017-07-13,9677457,Jacqueline,"I cannot recommend Li's place enough. The location is fantastic, in a quiet residential neighborhood but walkable to public transit and many other neighborhood gems. The bed is very comfortable, and the accommodations are perfect for a solo traveler exploring the city. When I arrived, Lidia had a full Swedish breakfast waiting, which was a lovely surprise. She also has a common room upstairs for her AirBnB guests fully equipped with a small fridge and coffee maker. Lidia has copious recommendations for things to do in Stockholm, and was lovely to chat with after a full day of exploring. She is so knowledgable and helpful- it was really like staying with a welcoming family friend and less like a stranger. I'll definitely stay with her again when I make it back to Stockholm!"
746,242188,172221482,2017-07-20,91524854,Victoria,"Li's place is well worth a visit. The apartment is centrally located with a whole floor dedicated to the Air BnB guests.

주인 할머님도 친절하시고 방도 깨끗하게 유지해주십니다.
전자레인지도 있고 커피포트 냉장고 드라이기 필요한건 다 있어요.

I was exhausted when I arrived after a work trip and as soon as I got there, checked in, lay on my bed - I feel into the best sleep I'd had in Scandanavia. Much better sleep than a hotel. Her place just had that safe ""home"" feel. Li was very helpful with directing me anywhere I needed to go in Stockholm. Thankyou Li!"
752,242188,185923605,2017-08-23,57745091,Marcelo,"La casa de Li tiene una ubicación privilegiada, a dos cuadras de la estación de metro Sodra, es confortable y muy cómoda, el baño es amplio y la habitación es muy confortable, cómoda y luminosa. Li es una anfitriona de primera, cuando llegué me esperó hasta las 22:45 Hs y como era tarde y no había ningún lugar par cenar me ofreció- de modo totalmente desinteresado- unas tostadas con dulce y un té y me explico sobre mis opciones turísticas en estocolmo( eran más de las 23
Hs), otro día me quizo invitar el desayuno - que no acepté pues me pareció que sería abusivo de mi parte. Tanta amabilidad y cuidado por
el turista resulta importante destacar, pues la verdad que me hizo sentir muy a gusto. Es una opción altamente recomendable. Gracias por todo"

The rooms were located upstairs, which she uses as a separate area for anybody staying there. This was nice as it created a common room space and it allowed for a separate space for the guests and the host. She also gave me a nice rundown of things to do in Stockholm when I first arrived and had suggestions whenever I needed them."

Several excellent bakeries and coffee houses lie within a 5-minute walk - you can even walk to Gamla Stan (the Old Town area) if you want. Li is friendly and helpful and a joy to talk with, making you feel right at home. Will definitely be my first choice when heading back to Stockholm!"

780,242188,235558772,2018-02-17,31614787,Gloria,"El alojamiento está muy bien comunicado por transporte público con la estación de Sodra a pocos metros, y a 1 parada de la estación central de Estocolmo.  Yo realicé la mayoría de trayectos hacia la ciudad andando, y era febrero y había nieve, es decir, el alojamiento está suficientemente cerca para ir dando un agradable paseo hasta el centro de Estocolmo. 
Lí es una excelente anfitriona, atenta, rápida en responder, deseosa de ayudar y de orientar con buenas informaciones sobre la ciudad. 
Mi habitación no era muy grande, pero era luminosa, estaba limpia y bien dotada en lo esencial.  La habitación está en la parte de arriba del piso (es tipo duplex) y fuera de la habitación hay un salón-zona común con sofás, neveras, microondas.. etc.. que te dá un espacio agradable para otros usos antes de irte a dormir.  
Creo que en conjunto es un lugar muy recomendable como opción para alojarse.  
Gracias Lí!!"

783,242188,242064328,2018-03-11,16825461,Stephanie,"I spent 3 nights at Lidias apartment. Lidia is a very kind host and gave me a lot of tipps about what to do in Stockholm. As I was traveling with my car she also helped me to understand the confusing parking situation and the parking fee system ;)

The offered room is in the upper part of the apartment. You share bath and a nice living room with other guests. The location in Södermalm is great, also quite close to public transport. I had a wonderful stay and can totally recommend this place."

She gave me advice on trains and buses, and she also had about 5 map/schedules/museums/etc in English for me to use while I was there. It was a great help. She offered me tea and discussed a lot of options I had while I was there. She is a great resource.

Where I stayed was upstairs and it was all mine. There are 2 rooms that she rents out, but I was the only one at that time. There was a TV, tea kettle, fridge, and I think a microwave in the living room area that was up there. Very spacey."

788,242188,258369963,2018-04-29,7068217,France,"The flat is located on the 5th floor of an apartment building that has an elevator.  The room is very quiet and clean linen and towels are provided.  Additionally, there is a lock on the door.  There is also a common area that is shared with guests from the 3 other bedrooms which contains two sofas and two chairs, as well as a fridge, a microwave, a kettle and kitchen dishware.  

The owner is very personable and will provide a lot of information on Stockholm. 

Good location, walkable distance to Gamla Stan and downtown (approx 20 min) but if you don’t care to walk, there is always the subway which is pretty close.

Good stay!"

805,242188,312856320,2018-08-24,66156623,Krista,"Loved this place! Li has several rooms she rents out each having their own charm. Arrived earlier than expected and no fuss was made to check me in early by Li. Beautiful location in a quite neighborhood minutes away from tram station, restaurants and grocery store. It’s about a 15 minute walk to see tourist area but the walk was beautiful! Will definitely be back! Krista "
806,242188,315141036,2018-08-28,22944766,Laura,"Li is a lovely host, as a solo female traveler I felt safe at all times at her place. It is in a nice area, close to public transport and very quiet at night (great for sleeping). There is a fridge and microwave to heat up any food you need, plus tea and coffee. The bathroom was very clean and great pressure in the shower, always nice to warm up after a long day exploring. Li was fantastic as a host and gave great tips for traveling around and what to see. Check in was a breeze, my flight got in at midnight, as it was delayed. Li was so kind and stayed up until 2 am giving me helpful directions from the airport to her place and getting me settled into her apartment. She went above and beyond that night and I felt so safe knowing that in a foreign city she was there to help me even though I arrived so late. She also let me leave my bags at her place on the final day (I had a night flight) so I could finish my time in Stockholm without having to drag around my luggage. I highly recommend this Airbnb and Li!"
807,242188,341624132,2018-10-27,66088348,Alexiane,"Tout était parfait : l’emplacement du logement, l’hospitalité, les équipements, les bonnes adresses ...  à recommander sans hésiter !"
808,242188,343583752,2018-11-01,185549737,Ray,Li is a very friendly host who has  great knowledge about sights and attractions. Her tips are very helpful. Her place is located in a very convenient area. Close to both the Commuter Train station and subway station. The neighborhood is very nice and idyllic. The check-in was super easy. The rooms in her place are absolutely superb for their prices. The whole apartment feels well organized and cozy. The room has nice decorations and the linens are always nice and clean. Her apartment has a very good laundry room but you will need her help to gain access to the laundry room. Overall Li’s place is probably one of the best places I have stayed and I definitely will recommend this place to anyone who wants to visit  the busy Stockholm but also wants to stay at a quite and nice place.
809,242188,346630295,2018-11-09,172657,Krishna,"Very cozy apartment with plenty of space in the private room and a nice living room just outside. A clean spacious bathroom as well. Apartment is located very close to bus, subway, and commuter rail, very convenient to and from Arlanda airport.

Li is very hospitable and friendly and was very helpful at pointing out the major attractions, ways to get around, and pro tips for those new to Stockholm."
810,242188,351013687,2018-11-21,2370659,Aimee,Li was an incredibly warm and welcoming host. She met me with a bunch of city maps and gave me an overview of the city and which museums to prioritize. Her hospitality made this a great experience!
811,242188,352411714,2018-11-25,20505608,Charlotte,"I had a lovely stay at Li's. She is super nice, helpful and welcoming and has a lot of cute attentions for her guests (like a tea when you arrive and a great explanation of the map and the city). I loved discussing with Li and she helped me with many things while I was there travelling alone (advice about visits, transport...). I felt like home  !
The place is super confortable and close to the city center. 
I highly recommend this place :) :)"

She is very kind, welcoming and friendly- with lots of local tips and info on what to see and how to get there. Li has a gorgeous and spacious home, close to transport, or walking distance to the food and music district and old town if you prefer to explore on foot. 

I had a great stay, would definitely recommend. I was the only guest when I stayed and had the top floor of the apartment to myself, with a bathroom, kettle and fridge and comfy sitting area full of light and plants and a big bathroom."
819,242188,416778506,2019-02-25,17732816,Romain,Li was very nice and welcoming. His appartment is well located and very clean.

826,242188,440743320,2019-04-21,243329322,An,"Een fijne, nette kamer met mooi uitzicht, maar de gordijnen laten wel veel licht door. Denk daaraan, als je in de lente/zomer gaat. De badkamer is ruim en de douche is heel goed, meteen warm water. Dat het toilet niet apart is, is soms wat lastig, als er andere gasten zijn en je dus moet wachten. Maar Li zei me wel maximaal drie gasten tegelijk te ontvangen. 
In de woonkamer staan heel wat boeken en een tv-toestel, een waterkoker en een microgolfoven. Water, thee en koffie zijn beschikbaar. En ook servies en bestek. Ik mocht ook haar keuken gebruiken om te koken en af te wassen. 
Li antwoordde heel snel op mijn berichten, heeft me goed uitgelegd hoe ik van de luchthaven tot bij haar geraakte en stond me op te wachten. Ze kan je heel wat info geven over wat te zien en te doen in en rond Stockholm. Ze legt je ook uit hoe ergens te geraken met het openbaar vervoer en zo.  En daarnaast hebben we heel wat gezellige babbels gehad over vanalles en nog wat :-) (Ik studeer Zweeds en dat was dus ook een goede oefening voor mij.)"
827,242188,445887074,2019-04-30,37242035,Denis,Lee met me with all hospitality and gave me very useful advices for the city. Her house is in a beautiful  silent place and around 3 min from commute train station. So getting to the city center takes around 5-10 minutes. Also her house quite near to the hipster part of Stockholm around 10-15 min walk.  So you can easily access great pubs and venues where you can spend evening.
828,242188,449708515,2019-05-07,12886826,Adele,Li's place is in a great location for using the trains and buses to explore Stockholm.  Li is available for advice about what to visit and how to get there.  Her place has cafes and supermarkets nearby.  It is a safe neighbourhood.  The set up of her place allows you to be quite independent.  I really enjoyed staying there.

I made my itinerary based on her advice and I loved the experience :) I only stayed for the weekend so I don’t have enough time to visit everything.

Y tal cual se muestra en las fotografías será lo que estará esperándote.

It is just 15 minutes from the center of stockholm , and Ali is really helpful. He helped us with metro's issues, and still borrowed us a a big useful map of the city. There are some little restaurants and a supermarket in the neighborhood . We really recommend ali, we couldn't have made a better choice. "

At first its a bit hard to find the house as there are not enough roadsigns in most part of Stockholm, and they are mostly swedish. Nevertheless, we found the house and it is very pretty and well organised. We love the kitchen especially!!! Ali is very kind to us and to save budgets, we are allowed to cook in his kitchen. everything is perfect! We will surely recommend others to stay at Ali's!!!!"

the house is also good located ( just 8 metro stops from downtown). the only minus point will be that the bathroom was on the first floor) and our room was on the third floor but we knew that before we booked :) . i will recommend Ali's place to people who are not looking for luxus and who are easygoing :) "

871,259025,1465858,2012-06-12,2100948,Ben,"My girlfriend and I stayed in Stockholm, Sweden for 9 days and 4 days was with Ali. We were very satisfied with our accommodations. He provided us security, free breakfast and a map. The room we stayed was larger than the originally reserved and he provided us with a TV just for us. Although we weren't at the house very much, the times we were we felt very comfortable and like home. His house is very cozy and warm. The subway was 7 min walk. Ali is always available for questions. We would definitely recommend it for anyone who doesn't want to pay an arm and a leg for expensive hotels in Stockholm."
872,259025,1503410,2012-06-18,105836,Guy,Ali was a very nice host. We had a bit of confusion finding the place so he came and picked up our suitcase in the city and left us the key.

Very close to the train station which is a plus, however, the time that we were there the train route to the Stockholm central station was closed for construction, so it took us a bit more time to get to where we wanted to go, but it was no problem at all.  Overall, it was a pleasure to stay at Alli's place and we definitely recommend this to other guests.  Stockholm, love!!    "
874,259025,1638588,2012-07-05,1600405,Joe,"Ali was out of town while we were visiting but arranged everything and our stay went very smoothly.  The apartment is beautiful and is a great value, especially compared to the high prices of hotels in Stockholm.  It took us about a half hour by train to get from the apartment to downtown, but the apartment is located very close to the station.  If you don't mind staying outside of the downtown area I would highly recommend this location."

As expensive as Stockholm is, Ali's room provided an affordable option for budget travelers. Ali's generosity is evident in his willingness to share his living space and assist travelers in navigating the city and their visit.

We were unaware of other travelers staying in the house prior to our arrival, which we would have liked to have known in advance.  "
878,259025,2059827,2012-08-21,1338310,Simon,"The house was really clean more than our expectation and also Ali is friendly and supportive to help guests to visit city. Due to his experience for managing guests he is professional in hospitality and providing peaceful environment for guests. 

As an overview I would say that we were really satisfy to stay his house and it was better than hotel in comparison to price and services. It is recommended for young travelers. "
879,259025,2615213,2012-10-15,3515254,Julian,"Me and my girlfriend had a nice 9 day stay in Ali´s house. The house is situated near to the subway and there are some supermarkets nearby. Ali is very helpfull and hospitable to his guests.

Best regards from Germany"
880,259025,2756122,2012-10-29,3689433,Dror&Shiri,We stayed at Ali's for 2 nights. The house is near the train station and it is fully equipped and very comfortable and so is the room. Ali is very nice and friendly.  we really enjoyed our stay.
881,259025,2915328,2012-11-19,1702045,Erik,Thank you for hosting us! Ali is a very friendly and helpful host. Nice room and close to the Tunnelbana station/city center. I can strongly recommend Ali and his rooms :)
882,259025,2975702,2012-11-26,1710964,Lauren,house was very nice and clean. It wasnt super close to the city but wasnt to bad to get to either. 
883,259025,3163704,2012-12-27,4027603,Jeffrey,"Ali's house is clean, tidy & spacious. It's definitely a comfortable place to stay in & it is about a 10 mins walk to the metro. He is also very helpful & granted us help when needed. He also helped us get breakfast over the Christmas season - which was kind of him. It was a nice experience staying with Ali & I would recommend his place if you are looking for a home away from home.  "
884,259025,3352594,2013-01-15,4386921,Pia,"eine wunderbare möglichkeit gut und günstig in stockholm zu nächtigen. ali ist sehr nett und hilfsbereit. der weg vom haus in die stadt ist im alltag kein problem. die bahnstation ist 3 min entfernt.
es lohnt sich das frühstücksangebot von ali für 4 euro/tag wahrzunehmen, da es sehr teuer ist in stockholm zu essen."
885,259025,4443211,2013-05-06,3347756,Alexandra,"Advantages: very closed to Subway (5-7 min), 20 min to the Center.
The room is suitible for 1-2 persons.
We were able to use fridge and microvawe.
Tea and coffee in the morning if neseccary
Ali is nice and helpful man.
Comparing to all the Stokcholm, the price is low.
Disadvantages:
We were with our baby, so the room was small for 3 persons and it was very stuffy.
The worst thing is that the toilet is on the first floor, we lived on the third... During the night it war really uncomfortable to go down. Besides, the toilet and bathroom is for ALL guests who stay at the house.
The ladder creacked loudly so that I woke up every time one of geusts went down.

"
886,259025,4862160,2013-05-29,6024909,Rebecca,"Ali was a friendly and warm host to us. He was helpful and answered all our questions.
His place is not in the centre of Stockholm but it's easy to take the metro ( about 15 minutes) downtown.
The house and the washroom were clean and we felt safe and welcomed there. "
887,259025,5007723,2013-06-07,5873200,Noor Adilah,"We had comfortable stay at Ali's place. The area is really easy especially for Muslim to find halal groceries & food. 

Thanks for sharing your stories and experience

"
888,259025,5284277,2013-06-22,6675948,Matt,Was a fantastic host. Would stay again.
889,259025,5463005,2013-07-01,6711096,Gustavo,"Ali's an excellent host and the house is clean and tidy,  very close to the Metro station: perfect for a pleasant stay! Thanks for all!"
890,259025,5575588,2013-07-07,567910,Marion & Evan,"It has been a nice time at Alis place. Everything was very clean, tidied up and cosy. Ali was very friendly and answered every mail I wrote him very fast and helpful. I would stay there again, but only together with somebody, because it's a kind of suburb, where are more men then women on the street and I felt kind of watched, especially at night. Probably it's only my opinion and I'm to sensitive, because nobody of the other persons who wrote here felt like that... "
891,259025,5773044,2013-07-15,7355659,Alexandra,"We came to Sweden as a couple for a three-day weekend. We visited Stockholm, it's really pretty. Ali is friendly and welcoming. It really helped us. The accommodation is well located for the metro. Thank you for your hospitality. Goodbye"
892,259025,5835234,2013-07-18,7191031,Fanny,"We had good days at Ali's place, he was very welcoming and helpfull, ready to discuss and to give us his good plans in Stockholm.
The subway is very close to the house and the line is direct to the town, so it was perfect for us.
We recommend Ali's home !"
893,259025,6101012,2013-07-30,5652023,Kerstin,"We stayed at Ali's house for 5 days and it was great.
The breakfast was perfect and the house was clean and our room comfortable. It was the best decision to book the breakfast, because at Stockholm the food is very expensive.
Ali answered every mail we wrote to him, perfect.
We can only recommend Ali's house.
"
894,259025,6318332,2013-08-08,914874,Adam,"This is a great, very affordable place to stay in Stockholm. The owner, Ali, has bedrooms on two floors that he rents out. We only met Ali briefly as he was away on holiday himself for most of our stay but he went out of his way to make sure we had everything we need. We were travelling with our 13 month old daughter and he arranged for us to have a cot in our room, which was hugely appreciated!

Guests are allowed to prepare their own breakfast in the kitchen, and also use the microwave. So if anyone wants somewhere they can do a lot of home cooking this might not be ideal. The house is situated within 5 minutes walking distance of Rinkeby T-bana station, when you can catch a train into the centre that takes around 15-20 minutes. There is a small convenience store opposite the house where you can buy a few essential items to makes lunches etc - Ali is happy for you to keep some items in the fridge or freezer.   "
895,259025,6403456,2013-08-11,4432560,Karin,"I stayed to Ali's house two nights. Unfortunately he wasn't at home that day, and there were an assistant. We arrived late, about at midnight, and we couldn't find the house. There was a girl that open us and she didn't know what to do and stayed al the time at the phone with the assistant, so it was a little annoying because it was raining and we were outside to wait. Apart from that the room was fine, the house was clean, it was like to be at home. I regret that Ali wasn't there, probably we wouldn't have that problems at the beginning. At the end my opinion isn't bad, if you need to stay in Stockholm a couple of days it's good! "
896,259025,6700709,2013-08-21,8082568,Quentin,"The place was as shown in the pictures and very clean everywhere, which we appreciated. The bathroom is just one flight of stairs down.

Ali was not there during our stay but a friend of him was there to welcome us and check if we needed everything, as well as take back the keys from us on our way out.

The house is part of a set of similar ones down the hill from the station, we found it quite easily. The area was quiet during our stay. We slept with the window open.

It takes around 30 minutes from the door of the house to the central station, and transportation is easy to take and works well in Stockholm, even in the night.
It might not be as convenient as a place in the center of the city, but it was very good for a young couple like us, trying to control our expenses. (Prices in central Stockholm are very high, even in hostels or bnb.)

There is an unlimited transportation pass (3-day or 7-day) you can buy which is very appropriate for the stay. I strongly recommend it, especially if you stay at Ali's. It's paid off in less than 10 trips (the 7-day one).

From the Arlanda airport, you can take an express train to the center if you want to pay for it, otherwise, a bus to Märsta can let you take a commuter train from there, and you only need that transportation pass all the way. (But it takes between 1h30 and 2h depending on how lucky - and efficient - you are with changes.)

Anyway thanks Ali for this place to stay which let us enjoy very well our stay in Stockholm at a reasonable price."
897,259025,6839448,2013-08-26,3821469,Lennart,"At first we want to thank that we have so spontaneously get a room in Ali's house.
The house was very clean and tidy. 
The room was big enough for us and equipped with fresh towels.
We were a little disappointed about the fact that we were not allowed to use the kitchen for cooking.

Thanks for the host...
Ali was not there during our stay but a friend of him was there to welcome us and check if we needed everything. "
898,259025,7127750,2013-09-07,3945457,Max,The apparment is indeed a bit off the center but totally manageable with the travel post recomended in the description. The room is spacious and everything is very tidy. Ali was a nice host and was very supportive.
899,259025,7415864,2013-09-19,7829129,Nathalje,We had a nice stay at Ali´s. He was friendly and everything was very clean and tidy.
900,259025,8053741,2013-10-14,4695225,Yiran,"Ali is a kind hearted person. The house is warm and quiet but a little bit far away from the center. If you choose to leave here, it is highly recommended buy a 24 hours ticket. Please ask the ticket office about the address when you get off the subway to void missing."
901,259025,9155406,2013-12-09,6984583,Koen,"Ali was an excellent host, always open for a friendly chat. The room was fine too. 

I particularly appreciated Ali's quick response to whatever query I had, booking Ali's place was easy and fast. 

His place is somewhat remote from the center of Stockholm but easily reachable by metro. It is a really good option as prices are particularly high in the city center.  

"
902,259025,10348406,2014-02-15,11133772,Smz,"I had a great time in Ali flat . He is a kind , friendly and has good hospitality . Bus stop was so close and undergrad was maybe 5 min walk . Thank you Ali and hope to see you again "
903,259025,12842761,2014-05-12,4481069,KwangSoon,"Ali's house is super clean, he welcomed us. The district is different than central Stockholm touristic place, you can stay in residential district. But if you like alcohol, it is not good idea to bring in home, pork as well. If u want to stay in a place calm, friendly but not too much, staying Ali's home would be good idea."
904,259025,15161970,2014-07-03,14805235,Wayne,Ali's apt. Is clean and comfortable. He went out of his way to meet us at t-bana station (a 5 min walk from his apt) when we arrived. We didn't really see him much because we were gone most of the time. It's about 15 min to the city center on the train. 
905,259025,15351158,2014-07-07,5489444,Vero,"La maison d'Ali est très jolie et très bien entretenue. Ali est un hôte discret et prévenant. Une chambre douillette. Métro  à qq mn à pied pour arriver à Stockholm plein centre en 20 mn. Nous avons passé des nuits tranquilles , nos journées étant totalement consacrées à la balade. Mercis à Ali pou nous avoir accueilli très tard, low- cost plane....arrivée un peu decalee...
"
906,259025,15706171,2014-07-14,15469486,Lena,"We had a comfortable short stay, everything was clean, the house was spacious, Ali is really friendly. Everything is really organized-you can notice that he has hosted a lot of guests and that his place is a good option to stay. And if you plan ahead, it's no trouble that you aren't allowed to use the stove, but there's a microwave. And everything else in the kitchen can be used as well. "
907,259025,16201060,2014-07-23,5609051,Aurélien,Our experience with Ali was wonderful. The house is situated in Rinkeby borough at about 10 metro stations from the Stockholm central station. The borough is very nice and quiet and prices much lower than in central Stockholm. The house is quite big and very clean. The room was impeccable and the beds confortable. Ali is very kind and we had a very good time with him. The day we arrived we couldn't eat because it was too late and restaurants had already closed so Ali peaked us in his car and drove us to eat something outside. He indicated us places to visit in Stockholm. His suggestions were very accurate. The optional breakfast was delicious and copious. We definitely recommend Ali for a stay in Stockholm and will choose him again the next time we go to Stockholm. Thanks a lot Ali!
908,259025,18255512,2014-08-24,18567364,Jacques,"Ali est un hôte charmant et très sympathique. Il nous a mis tout de suite à l'aise et nous a donné de nombreux renseignements très utiles pour  notre visite de Stockholm. Le gîte est propre et fonctionnel, l'organisation parfaite. A recommander absolument."
909,259025,18597561,2014-08-28,20386635,Rafael,"Ali was very nice to us. His house is very clean and all in order. Our room was very comfortable, bright and large enough for the two of us.
The location was what we were looking for, close to bus stop, short walking distance to metro station and a convenient store across from the house. He sent us a message before check in giving us clear directions how to come to his house and he even suggested to buy the 7 day transportation card which we enjoyed (even though we only stayed 4 nights) but it was cheaper and we could hope in hop off in trams, buses, trains and even some boats. It was really worth!
Overall we had a very nice stay there and it was nice to be in a very clean and cute house.
Thanks Ali.
Rafael and Cecilia."
910,259025,18951811,2014-09-03,19327203,Daniel,"Ali, se porto muy bien con nosotros, nos informo de todos los transportes que podíamos conseguir, y eventos a los que podíamos asistir, además tenia folletos y mapas de la ciudad.
Su casa está a escasos 30 m. de la parada de autobús que lleva a la estación central, y a cuatro o cinco minutos de la entrada al metro, así que esta muy bien comunicada.
Además Alí, el día de partida que teníamos una hora de salida complicada (La 1h 30' de la mañana), estuvo despierto por si necesitábamos algo, y el día de antes me indicó el número de autobus que teníamos que coger, y me acompaño hasta la parada.
Todo muy bien. En la casa entre el día , no estabamos, porque saliamos a ver cosas, y solo estuvimos para dormir y para desayunar, así que sobre eso no puedo comentar nada.
En general salvo un mal entendido por nuestra parte sobre el tipo de comida que podíamos utilizar (que no tuvo ninguna repercusión porque respetamos sus costumbres y no nos afectó en nada porque enfrente hay un supermercado, y compramos alimentos sin cerdo) todo muy bien."
911,259025,31413151,2015-05-04,21701675,Tandy,"Didn't have much interaction with Ali, but he did welcome us on short notice and for that we are grateful. He even offered to drive us to get food since we arrived late. As for location, it is 30 minutes from the central station, further than I expected, but the metro station is a short walk away. Something to note is that it is located in the suburbs, so don't expect a lively neighborhood atmosphere. One thing that did confuse me though was the hefty cleaning fee I was charged, despite the fact that we were required to clean on the day of our departure. All in all, Ali's place served its purpose fine, but I would seek accommodation elsewhere next time I'm in Stockholm. "
912,259025,32557881,2015-05-19,31645626,Snehadri,"Ali is a very gracious host and we felt welcome at his place. He was nice enough to arrange breakfast on a short notice and also arranged a taxi for us when we needed it.
The house was easy to find. The room is perfect for three people and the beds are really comfortable. The house is very well maintained and cleanliness is emphasized. The neighbourhood is quiet and a 5-minute walk from the metro station. The area is easily accessible by public transport, being around 20 minutes away from central Stockholm by metro. 
I am glad I chose Ali's place for our stay and I would choose it again."
913,259025,33415451,2015-05-27,29523083,Julie,Great stay. There were many other rooms for other visitors as well in the place. A little far from the main area but it's right next to the metro station and a bus station so it wasn't a big deal. Ali was super accomodations considering how my friend and I made this listing last minute.
914,259025,35142570,2015-06-15,33952961,Darina,"Bylo to moc fajn, měli jsme svůj klid. Škoda, že jsme nemohli používat kuchyň."

917,259025,53317655,2015-11-08,32818484,Sakshi,The house is very clean and well maintained. Ali helped us with all kinds of information required about/ in Stockholm.
918,259722,961982,2012-03-01,1505127,Pedro,"I highly recommend Marcello. he is an excellent host, since  I arrived until the minute I left, he was very helpful and always trying to make a  memorable time in Stockholm. He pretty much provided with everything I needed; tips where to go in the city, computer, even a cell phone. Definitively it went beyond my expectations. Last day he made a great farewell lunch. No better place to stay while in Stockholm. He will make you feel
like at home away from home.

Thanks Marcello"
919,259722,1078008,2012-04-03,881441,Matthew,"Marcelo is a very nice and easy going guy. The room is good, and was everything I needed. There is also a major shopping centre and train station just a short walk away from the apartment. All in all I think it's a nice place to stay."
920,259722,1221733,2012-05-03,1501340,Andrea,"Half of the room's walls are glass windows, both looking outside of the building and in the living room. These glass walls are covered with some tents, that's the privacy level the room enables. 
The real problem is actually having good sleep, as sun rises very early in the morning. Also I have been awaken by the  host, coming in at late night or couldn't fall asleep if somebody was watching tv or talking or cooking in the living room: the glass walls won't provide isolation either from light and sound. In one month I seldom awaken later than 6 am: plane mask is a must eventually bring earplugs.
The room is packed with kids stuff and the guest's cupboard is in the living room, in the room there is a narrow table and a kid's stool. 
I don't recommend this, especially if you plan to stay more than few days or if you are coming here to work."
921,259722,1600824,2012-07-01,2124234,Romain,"Marcelo is the best hote of the world !

The apartment is very clean and neat, and the facilities are excellent. The apartment is well situated, only about 5 min walk from a great shopping mall (with a good food court)  and the train and bus station.

I would recommend Marcelo as a host and would stay there anytime in future if I get the chance.

923,259722,2454577,2012-09-30,1001904,Anastasios,"Marcelo is very friendly and hospitable. He even allowed me to have an ethernet cable running through his living room so i could have internet access. The park right behind the room is just amazing. You can take walk trails through the woods and pick up berries. 
The room is relatively small but it was just what i needed for that small period of time. Thanks Marcelo!"

Down the road also within minutes is the transportation and shopping hub while also nearby the other way is the local train going out to the airport which may also be reached via the bus 179 right outside the building!
The room itself is very cozy & light linked to a neat outdoor terrace.
Amenities in the kitchen, bathroom & living room is very modern, well working & adequate while however for persons not used to sharing a flat with 2 other space & privacy may be a bit crammed/limited at times while very friendly & open minded :)
Thank you for a great hosting Marcelo."

I never had any problem while I stayed there. I was given separate cupboard, freeze shelf, towels and bed. The owner is the nicest person you ever can meet. You will feel like home away from home. The vicinity of T-banna and shops made the whole experience better. "
931,259722,29920847,2015-04-14,9706291,Harald,"During the first month of my work in Stockholm I stayed at Marcelo's apartment. The apartment/room is equipped with everything you need to have a convenient stay.  Marcelo is a open-minded and attentive host. I can highly recommend him and his place.

The bedroom I stayed in is comfortable and private, which is very important to me. His apartment is located close to a metro station (a 5-8 minute walk) and it only takes about 15 minutes or so to take the train into city center. I was very pleased with how accessible everything was. I highly recommend anyone stay here."

936,259722,143982508,2017-04-14,64937643,Heikki,"I stayed here for 2 months. My stay was better than expected. Communication with Marcelo is easy. Before I came I was worries that room would be cold because it is mostly windows but I was wrong. Room was nicely warm even though there was snow outside. Marcelo kept apartment really clean. Location is superb - only few minutes walk to metro station, buss station and nearest shopping center. I can highly recommend. Compared to other listings in Stockholm this was good quality for the money."
937,259722,274416587,2018-06-09,37780218,Pinak,"It's a beautiful place in laps of nature. It's nearby to Kista Galleria and just opposite to Kista Park. So it's an ideal place if you love peace and nature. Metro station, restraunts, pubs... Everything is nearby. The apartment is beautiful and equipped with all necessary amenities. I enjoyed my stay and recommend each and everyone to check this place if living in Kista."
938,259722,322939380,2018-09-14,201262119,Sinan,"Marcelo is a wonderful host. He is very professional with allocating the space you need for your groceries, laundry, trash, etc. and labeling them. It makes you feel very comfortable. The room isn't big but's it's perfectly reasonable for a single tennant. I's right as pictured, with a wardrobe and studying table. The lighting is very good, many different lamps and the room gets good amount of sunlight. Since it's ground level it's easy to access. It's located very good as well, one bus stop or 6 minutes walk from Kinsta centrum, where there's subway and all the stuff you need; great shopping center.

The neighbourhood of Hammarby Sjöstad is beautiful with its modern architecture and all its watersides. The ferry to Söder even goes until midnight. Rodrigo gave us many tips, he and Cecilia were most helpful right from the booking. We enjoyed our stay very much and would rent their flat again any time.

It’s extremely comfortable, bright and well-equipped. We loved the heated floor system in the bathroom and the Internet connection was lightning fast. Having an iPad at our disposal was a great plus to check the weather forecast every morning. 
The location is perfect too: within walking distance of Gamla Stan. If you prefer, bus n°2, which stops right next to the building, will take you to the city center in a matter of minutes. There are plenty of restaurants and bars in the neighbourhood and a rather large supermarket close by.
Emma was a lovely hostess and gave us many good tips. We felt very much at home in Stockholm.

It happens that some trend do emerge and focus on a given sort of interest ( for exemple the modern scandinavian literature ) and each year we organise a trip renting an apartment related to the part of the world we have dealing with. Before Sweden, we travelled to St Petersburg, Vienna, etc.

The location was great, lots of cafes and boutiques in the area; it was only a short bus (#2) into the city or a 45 minute walk. 

Emma was a wonderful host even going to the trouble of buying a breakfast foods, milk and juice for our stay before she left.

She was available to answer any questions and we can't think of anything that was missing.

Thank you Emma"
956,274876,2307243,2012-09-17,2682604,Shaun,"We loved Staying at Emma's place in Stockholm. Emma herself was very friendly, and the apartment is wonderful. The place is stylish, spacious, and located in one of those neighborhoods that's nice and quiet but also just a short walk away from the more exciting parts of town. I really can't think of a single negative thing about our stay. Highly recommended!"
957,274876,3252180,2013-01-03,340618,Anca,"We stayed at Emma's apartment with 5 adults for the New Year's celebration. The initial contact with Emma by email and sms was very easy and friendly. All necessary information (how to get there, whether we need to take towels etc) were given and we were looking forward to the trip.

When we met Emma she was very friendly and easy going. She showed us the great apartment and left a little note with tips about restaurants, shops and how to reach her in the case of an emergency. 

The flat itself was great. Enough space for five adults to sleep, eat (even a big New Year dinner), lounge on the sofa and read lots of newspapers. There was one room with a big double bed, another one with a king size bed and a third room with two single bed. So if necessary a 6th person can easily find space. 
The open kitchen has a big table, great for meals or board game nights in and the adjoined living room has a comfy sofa and armchairs. 
The flat was equipped very well. There was everything you could wish for (towels, bedlinen, crockery, cutlery, kitchen appliances, wifi, ipod adapter for big speakers etc) and we really enjoyed staying in the apartment. There was a small balcony overlooking the yard and the stylish yet comfortable design and interior of the flat made us feel at home very soon. 

The location is great. It's in the middle of Södermalm and you can easily walk to Götgatan/Folkungagatan/Medborgaplatsen and/or Slussen station (to head into town or take the ferry to Skeppsholmen or Djurgarden). It's a great way to enjoy the little shops and cafés along the way. But it's also possible to take the 53, 2 or 66 bus towards Slussen or directly into town. It takes only 15 mins max. There is also a night bus. 
The nearest supermarket is only 2 minutes away and there are many restaurants around. 

We really enjoyed staying in Emmas apartment and can recommend it to everyone. There was nothing missing and even though we only met her briefly we always had the feeling that we could feel at home and could take things from the cupboards, should we have forgotten to buy anything for our meals. 
We will be back!"

961,274876,4783236,2013-05-26,4761840,James,"We couldn't have enjoyed staying at Emma's lovely pad more. It's a great space to hang out in and relax, spotlessly clean, comfortable and with all mod cons. It's a great location, 10 mins walk to downtown Sodermalm but also quiet enough that you get peace and quiet. Emma herself was so helpful and welcoming, being really flexible about arrival times and giving us hints and tips before she departed to make our stay a great one. Stockholm is a beautiful and friendly city, with loads to do; we could have stayed longer than our 4 days. All in all a great experience - as a first time Air BnBer, I'll do it again, and would wholeheartedly recommend Emma's lovely flat for a stay in Stockholm. "
962,274876,4992397,2013-06-06,394920,Danny,"We really enjoyed our stay at Emma's place. Arriving late in the evening, Emma awaited us, made us feel at home very soon and gave a tour of the place. She had even bought bread for the next morning's breakfast! 

Emma's place is perfectly fitted for a company of 5. It is located in a quiet neighborhood but within walking distance of the old town. Södermalm is the place to be if you enjoy vintage shops and cafés, nice little parks and a friendly relaxed atmosphere.

We stayd at Emma's for 5 nights and it felt like we lived in Stockholm! We were out most of the day but had dinner near the apartment in some of the surrounding little restaurants. It felt great coming home at night in such a relaxing neighborhood.

I definitely recommend Emma and her place and we would stay here again if we were to come to Stockholm again with 4 or 5 people.

Thank you Emma!"
963,274876,5456675,2013-07-01,5817475,Ashley,"Emma's place is wonderful and convenient by bus to the city center.  Her father met us to let us into the apartment and he was a wealth of information about Stockholm, both its history as well as recommendations what to do during our stay.  Also the elevator was wondering being that I was 7.5 months pregnant at the time.  The building is quite and with a great courtyard.    "

It is situated in a calm area close to bus stops and within a short walking distance from the old town. As a Mom of a three-year-old I also appreciated a great deal the many toys that we could borrow in the lovely yard - this meant that we could also spend time in a warm weather outside in the inner yard while our son was playing...Plenty of restaurants nearby (you can even have some take out food from the Pizzeria just 100m away or Indian/Thai...). Emma as a host was very helpful and kind so we would highly recommend her flat to all those who wish to spend some time in Stockholm and discover this beautiful city from another perspective and another neighborhood than the ones where many of the hotels are located. Thanks Emma!  
967,274876,6269462,2013-08-06,5215494,Robert,"My sister Mary-Ann, her husband John, my wife Melissa and I spent 11 days at Emma Hedberg’s apartment on Erstagatan between July 25th and August 5th this year. It was a marvelous experience, from the bright and spacious bedrooms, to the pleasant kitchen and dining area, including the wonderful balcony. Emma left us nice, fresh towels for our use, as well as kitchen cabinets and drawers full of all the plates / glasses / utensils and other items that made our stay very convenient. The central city location was also very advantageous and fit well with our individual plans for a wonderful vacation. We fully recommend Emma’s apartment for anyone contemplating renting a 3-bedroom facility in Stockholm. (Robert and Melissa)

My husband and I along with my brother and sister-in-law stayed in Emma's lovely apartment for 11 days this summer.  It was a wonderful experience.  The apartment was clean and well organized and beautifully decorated.  It is located in a quiet part of Stockholm yet only minutes away from lively cafes, shops, restaurants and places with breathtaking views of the city.  I met Emma when we first arrived and she was welcoming and gracious.  She offered her cell phone number and made herself available if there was anything we might need.  I would recommend Emma's apartment to anyone looking for a charming home to rent in the middle of Stockholm, large enough to share with others and still private enough to retreat to after a busy day about town.

968,274876,6666429,2013-08-20,7650082,Christos,"Our stay  at EMMA's flat was our  first experience using AIRBNB site. What we have experienced from the first moment that we met  EMMA and throughout the duration of our stay in this flat was wonderful. A real Lady, with a very warm reception, in a very beautiful, clean, with very nice decoration, modern and comfortable for our family of five persons, home. Very quiet building, in an ideal neighborhood, near to the GAMLA STAN, with very good transportation and with the most beautiful, modern and youthful bar-restaurants of STOCKHOLM. Our holidays in this city will be unforgettable and the main reason for this is that the choice of the flat was the best we could have done. For anyone who wants to start and finish his vacation in beautiful STOCKHOLM I recommend it unreservedly. We hope in the future that our choices on AIRBNB wil be so good.     VALUE FOR MONEY 10."

The flat is great - well situated in the coolest part of Stockholm - a genuine home away from home.  Emma was a lovely and really welcoming host.  Accessible.  Nice.  Full of good counsel.

The flat is bright and airy and very well appointed.  Near by is food, and shopping and the easiest of access to one of the coolest cities in Europe.  We could have just moved in and stayed...

The home is well furnished, stylish and clean with a great feel to it. There is a lovely balcony to enjoy the sunshine and view - no need for a clock, you can read the time on the Church tower!

She was incredibly helpful from the very moment we touched down (with directions to get to her apartment with multiple options) to waiting for us in the apartment upon arrival to give us advice on all things Stockholm in person.

Södermalm is a nice area to stay in with lots of cafes, little shops and greenery all on the doorstep. It is also well connected which makes it easy to get to the center of the city.

Emma and her family were very attentive and made sure that we had a comfortable stay by checking with us if everything was going well and if we needed anything.

I can highly recommend the apartment to anyone wishing to visit Stockholm!"

It was relatively easy to get to with very frequent bus service nearby. We appreciated the fun decor of the apartment and the nice little touches like the balcony overlooking the courtyard, extra charging cords for the electronics, and cool furniture. This would be an ideal place for a couple, a small group, or a family.

Emma was a great host. She took the time to meet us in person and give suggestions on what to see in Stockholm. She was very responsive with inquiries that we had during our stay. I would highly recommend this place!"
996,274876,42835018,2015-08-16,32824293,Sara,Emma's daughter met us and was very informative.  She gave us tips on the neighbourhood and left us with more local information than we needed.

997,274876,45121423,2015-08-31,4758662,Glenn,"Perfect Airbnb experience. This is a lovely apartment in a great Södermalm neighborhood with bus stops within feet of the front door (and Stockholm buses are just as easy and pleasant as the subways), restaurants and grocery stores all around, and the beautiful Sofia church looking prettily down on you. The space is great (the picutures are very accurate), Emma was super helpful, and we had a great time for our two-week stay."

999,274876,46860862,2015-09-14,30968324,Rachel,"3 coworkers and I stayed at Emma's apt, and it was wonderful. She met us at the apt, and gave us recommendations. She was super welcoming and so kind. The apartment has plenty of space; didn't feel crammed with 4 of us. It was also clean, comfortable and super cute. The neighborhood is perfect; quiet, yet plenty of shops and restaurants within walking distance. Not touristy at all, which we were hoping to avoid. Favorite restaurants were Gossip, Greasy Spoon and Urban Deli. All in all, awesome experience and I would stay again in a heartbeat."
1000,274876,84039522,2016-07-05,5922152,Jolie,"The apartment is beautiful, quiet, and in a great location.  It was extremely clean and very well organized.  I would recommend this apartment to anyone with a family.  Also the location is great for adults and children. The balcony and beds make the place cozy. Emma was very accommodating from the beginning.  She let us arrive later after we had agreed upon a time and stay later.  She laid out everything necessary for our family, quickly explained how things worked in the apartment, and left us to discover on our own.   I hope to return!"
1001,274876,84811991,2016-07-09,476657,Jason,Our stay was excellent. The apartment was comfortable and easy and Emma was supportive and helpful. We would definitely stay here again if we come back to Stockholm.
1002,274876,92595632,2016-08-09,13766845,Pascal,"It was a pleasure staying at Emma's apartment in Sodermalm, the nicest borough to stay for visiting Stockholm. The apartment is very comfortable for a family of 5 or 6. It's cosy sitting outside on the balcony and right around the corner there are shops, a supermarket and good restaurants. It's only 15 minutes walking to the old city, but the City Bike and bus stop are only a few hundred meters away. Emma is very helpful and welcoming, even at 11 p.m. when you arrive from a late flight."
1003,274876,98060567,2016-08-29,74200296,Bertrand,"Exceptional place. Emma's appartment is very well designed and decorated. A lot of charm. We had a great time ?family of 5 for 5 days

1007,274876,123415481,2016-12-29,27886972,Pascale,"Perfect!
Emma is very helpful: she gave us all the explanations we needed before the trip and when arriving.
Very nice apartment, warm and cosy.  We are a family of 5 persons, and it was just fine. 
Very good location: quiet area but close to lots of restaurants.  Also very close from a store (open 7:00-22:00 - very convenient).
Great welcome from Emma (sweets, tea and coffee for the breakfast).
That's the place where we want to be if we go to Stockholm again!
Thank you Emma for sharing your lovely home!"
1008,274876,155850128,2017-05-29,25759765,Jorge,"Emma has been a real super host, the best one we had so far in Airbnb. She was waiting for us at the apartment when we arrived and gave us good tips to move around. Before we arrived and during our stay, Emma was very responsive to our emails, answering within minutes if not seconds. Amazing! The apartment is located in a very nice area. It has a perfect size and orientation. You will fall in love with its small terrace from where to enjoy the sun in the morning while having a cup of coffee. The apartment was very clean and Emma bought some ""welcome food"" for us. I strongly recommend this place to everyone looking for a great place to stay to visit the beautiful city of Stockholm.

1009,274876,157922285,2017-06-05,44494137,Nathalie,"Emma is an amazing, reliable host that knows how to make u feel at home away from home. Her apartment is cozy, quiet, very well located in a great area of the city. Can really recommend this place!"

1011,274876,167257636,2017-07-06,130829272,Paul,"Very lovely flat in an upscale, quiet neighborhood.  Very close to bus lines and restaurants.  Emma was out of town during our stay, but was still available to us and always responded very quickly."
1012,274876,175252278,2017-07-28,4442603,Aurélie,"L'appartement de Emma est très agréable, il est situé dans une jolie résidence. On s'y sent très bien, idéale pour des couples ou famille.
Le bus est vraiment à quelques minutes, on peut aussi prendre très facilement le bateau pour changer d'île.
Emma est une super hôte, très accueillante, elle se tient disponible durant le séjour pour répondre à nos questions."

1014,274876,179996943,2017-08-09,70572775,Jonathan,"Lovely, clean apartment in great, residential neighborhood of ""happening"" Sodermalm. We were traveling with our 4 children, so the space was just a wee bit tight - but not my much. Emma was very responsive and accommodating and seemed happy to be sharing her home (she even let us eat her ice cream!). Was an excellent location for a family - nearby parks, easy walks, QUIET at night. Bus to ferry + walking to Djurgarden was about 20-30 minutes. Not a problem for us and we quite enjoyed the walks. Two quirks to know about: no coffee machine (at least that we were able to find - but great cafes very close by!), and no drawer or closet space for your clothes -  (this is still Emma's home so all of her family's items in place). Would certainly return."
1015,274876,181749466,2017-08-13,84772658,Stefan,"Emma is een vriendelijke gastvrouw en heeft ons bij aankomst goede tips gegeven over de omgeving. Het mooie appartement bevind zich in een rustige nette wijk, maar toch op enkele minuten lopen afstand van winkelcentra, musea en knooppunten voor het openbaar vervoer. We hadden een Stockholm pass gekocht waarmee we toegang hadden tot 60 bezienswaardigheden, en de hop-on-hop-off boot, die op 10 minuten loopafstand van het appartement een stopplaats heeft."
1016,274876,184346595,2017-08-19,92308383,Susan,"Beautiful, tidy, very clean apartment, well equiped. Perfect location. We were a family of 5 who had plenty of space. Playgrounds, coffee, supermarkets, beer! all close by. Trendy area. Plenty of running routes. Fantastic host."
1017,274876,190789531,2017-09-05,53860585,Beverly,Emma was a gracious host and very accommodating. Communication was very quick and easy.  Her home is well furnished and our family of 4 adults and 2 children ages 2 and 4 enjoyed staying there.  The neighborhood is great with cafes and restaurants and walking distance to many stores.  We would definitely stay there again and thank Emma for making our stay in Stockholm and enjoyable one!
1018,274876,199141279,2017-10-01,11176270,Camilla,"Emma is an excellent host and her apartment is beautiful, has a lot of space and is clean.

1019,274876,216537210,2017-12-04,49371185,Brad,"Emma was a great host and very responsive to our questions and concerns.  Check in and out was very easy.  Her home was very warm, inviting and fully stocked with all of the necessities needed for out stay.  The neighborhood is outstanding.  We would highly recommend Emma's home for your stay in Stockholm."
1020,274876,246828885,2018-03-26,53720294,Jessica,"Emma's place is in a perfect location for folks who want to take advantage of an area of town that is off the tourist path, but full of the local experience.  Her apartment was within walking distance of many amazing restaurants and boutique shops, along with various parks.  We traveled with four kids, and  were able to explore the immediate neighborhood and venture to the more touristy areas (Gamla Stan, Djurgarden) with ease.  Emma was immediately responsive to any question or request, and made sure we were perfectly set up for our stay.  Her apartment was exceptionally clean and very comfortable for our family of six.  Located on the fourth floor, but with an elevator so easy to access."
1021,274876,263528597,2018-05-12,84578012,Margaret,"What a find!

All her food recommendations we're spot on!
Love the location, lots of restaurants and shops.
Highly recommend Emma and her flat!"

Easy walking all around SoFo, easy access to rest of city. Emma knows some great places to eat, lots of delicious choices. Emma was super helpful answering our questions about the area and the apartment. Would love to go back."
1026,274876,282448707,2018-06-27,32429451,Lisa,"We had a great stay in Emma's apartment! It is bright and spacious, trendy and tidy, and located in a really awesome area of Södermalm. Emma was a fantastic host: checking in and out was a breeze, she was communicative throughout, and provided us with some great local recommendations that we took advantage of during our stay. Thank you Emma!"
1027,274876,287343256,2018-07-08,67397009,Angela,"Our family of five (kids 2.5, 8, 11) really enjoyed our 8 day stay at Emma’s flat. It is centrally located in a quiet residential area (we left the windows open at night), with easy access to bus and ferry, yet only ages short blocks away from fantastic cafes and shops. Emma greeted us as the flat and left us with helpful advice, welcome treats and a fully stocked kitchen. The flat has anything you could think to need. The beds were very comfy and the apartment very bright and cheery. Do keep in mind this is Emma’s home, so there isn’t anywhere to hang clothing, but we managed just fine out of our suitcases. Absolutely loved our time in Stockholm and our stay in Emma’s flat."
1028,274876,290896140,2018-07-15,193907418,Emiko,"Emma was easy to communicate with and the apartment was nice and clean. I really appreciated the small touches like stuffed animals in the crib. I came with my parents, husband, and 2 year old, and it was perfect for us. A nice neighborhood, close to everything. I would recommend."
1029,274876,295758666,2018-07-24,65629268,Kristin,"We stayed for 5 nights at Emma's place as a family of 6 (2 adults, 1 teenager,2 year old twins and a 6 year old). We had a fantastic time, the place is exactly as described, in a lovely and safe area of town. Emma even had a cot and a highchair for us and in the yard of the building is a nice little area with some toys where the kids could play safely. The apartment is well equipped and there was plenty of space for all of us. We had our camper van with us and we could park it directly outside the building and parking fees were not too high given it was in a city. The bus stop was just about 100 metres down the road and a supermarket and Systembolaget in walking distance nearby, as well as various restaurants, bars and a lovely park with playground. We walked to most places during our stay, the location is great for exploring Stockholm."

1035,274876,315193610,2018-08-28,160382095,Lisa,This is a GREAT apartment with a very helpful host. The location in Soderman is such a nice neighborhood with amazing restaurants and an easy walk or ferry ride to all that Stockholm has to offer. It is also a beautiful well-loved home and feels very cozy with a beautiful courtyard and small patio. 
1036,274876,317528785,2018-09-02,51540163,Gene,"Our stay with Emma was outstanding. The initial communications where informative and accurate. She even gave us a few hints for local eateries. The check—
in was a self check-in, but with her instructions where very easy.  The apartment itself is in a perfect location to discover the city and just a 15 min walk to Galma Stan. The flat is on the 4th floor, but there is an elevator. Our initial impression when walking in, was the space being immaculate, homey, and very well designed and thought through. It is her apartment and like others have stated there isn’t much closet space but that’s not really an issue. To make this stay over the top, Emma even left some food for us to have breakfast the next day, including milk as she knew we where coming to stay with a baby. She also had a crib all set up for us as well. One of the best stays through this app we have ever had. Was a true pleasure."
1037,274876,320731955,2018-09-09,5384871,Vincent,Emma’s place is lovely. It has all the things you need to enjoy Stockholm at the fullest.

We stayed here with our three kids and it could not be more perfect for us! Two of them stayed in a room with two singles, we had a master bedroom and our baby had a room to himself with a crib she set up for us prior to arrival. This is the perfect place to stay with your family! My husband and I also enjoyed wine on the balcony after the kids went to bed. Emma is a wonderful host, she helped provide recommendations prior to our trip and was a resource if needed while we were there. She also left us with traditional food and some groceries to get us started. And cookies! :) I would definitely stay here again if I were ever to come back, and I would recommend this place to anyone. We felt so lucky to have found it!"

She made sure we felt very welcome and comfortable, which was greatly appreciated, especially after our transatlantic travel. As the photos indicate, her apartment is extremely well-designed, decorated and organized. It was also incredibly clean and very functional. The building is also really nice, well maintained and extremely quiet, while just outside, the neighborhood is filled with convenient shops, restaurants and cafes and a wide assortment of cute local boutiques. I've been to Stockholm many times, but I really enjoyed my first experience in Södermalm. It is still very central and offers quick and easy transportation links. I hope to have the chance to stay at Emma's next time I visit Stockholm."

We stayed in Stockholm for five days with our two small children and Emma’s home was perfect. Located in a beautiful neighborhood on a quiet street, the location was ideal for our family. Emma provided all the amenities for our kids which was so thoughtful! She also had various guidebooks and personal recommendations for the area and for fun things to do with kids in the city.

Emma was very easy to get in touch with, check in was a breeze, she had sorted us with breakfast and gave us all the local tips one would need to stay as a local.  Best part was coming back each day, felt like coming back to our own welcoming home.  It was that comfortable!  Next time as a group in Stockholm, we wouldn’t hesitate to book Emma’s place again."

Her place is clean and stylish.  It's located in a nice neighbourhood, that's close to many different bus stops that can easily get you to most places you need to go in Stockholm within 15 minutes.

Shop closeby, 3 bedrooms , dishwasher, everything you need for a comfortable stay in stockholm

1 bathroom is perhaps a downside when youre with more people but you can organise around that.

Emma is very accomodating and a fast communicator. 

The outside terrass was a nice bonus that we used quit a lot"

We are a family of 5, and Emma’s place had plenty of room for us to be comfortable. Emma left breakfast for us, and the kitchen was stocked with everything we needed to make breakfast before heading out for the day. Emma left tips on local restaurants and some of her favorite sites, as well as some tips about the Swedes. Beds were super comfortable and black our curtain in the master was fab. We would recommend Emma’s place, and would stay here again if we return to Stockholm."
1062,278311,788488,2011-12-16,1451147,Jose Gabriel,"The apartment is very well connected to the center of Stockholm. Within 15 minutes Pendelstag (suburban train) and 25 minutes by Metro, with no changes to the T-Centralen. The apartment is comfortable and has access to the subway, train, bus and supermarket nearby.
Linnea is a woman comfortable that makes you feel at home. It was a complete success for choosing this apartment in my stay in Sweden."
1063,278311,968020,2012-03-04,1518313,Catalina,"The place is really nice, is very easy to get to the center of the city from here, the metro station is nearby. The flat is pretty and the room is big enough to make you feel comfortable. Linnéa is a really nice person and very helpful all the time, she always try to help as much as possible. 
I will definitely stay here again.   "
1064,278311,1368370,2012-05-28,2423041,PhaUl,"Es en lugar muy bonito, Linnéa es una persona muy amable y divertida, tomando el tren en 24 minutos estas en la estación central por lo que recomiendo el lugar.  Tu te sientes como en tu casa."
1065,278311,1407292,2012-06-03,2413245,Mikhail,"I stayed at Linnéa's apartment for 3 nights and was pleasantly surprised by her friendliness and hospitality. Linnéa was very helpful in getting around Stockholm and the apartment felt very homelike. It's also well connected to the city, being close both to subway and commute train stations. "
1066,278311,1438942,2012-06-08,2417920,Juhan,"Beautiful, clean and quiet place; nice and friendly host. Everything went well and I can really recommend this place for anyone visiting Stockholm. The train and metro stations are really close.
Unfortunately I did not have time to walk around in Farsta Strand, but something for the next time, then.
Thanks, Linnéa!"
1067,278311,1672322,2012-07-09,1615177,Kristen,Linnea responded really quickly to a last minute stay request I made for my friend travelling that day to Stockholm. He said she was really nice!
1068,278311,1765014,2012-07-21,2666785,Ryan,"Linnea is very helpful and friendly. The place was clean and in a beautiful location with parks and places to walk. It's not however close to the city, though it's fine if you don't mind catching the train back and forth. "
1069,278311,1805291,2012-07-26,2637443,Roy,"She was quite watching my arrival time because I was not sure about it, but there was no problem, she was waiting for me. The house was as she describe, no complaints at all,  and she is a quite interesting person to know, shame I didn't find the moment.

I would recommend it, Thanks Linnéa :)

PD: during summer there's a lot of hours of sun, be prepared with a mask for your eyes if you are not use to sleep with daylight..., in the north of Europe the people are use to sleep like that, but not in other countries ;) "
1070,278311,2052490,2012-08-21,2106107,Enrico,"Linnéa's apartment is a very charming one, close to the city center for those who want to visit Stockholm, and close to a beautiful natural reserve, for those who enjoys staying in Nature. Linnéa is a helpful and nice person.
Tack så mycket, Linnéa!"
1071,278311,2122409,2012-08-28,2454904,Gianluca,"Staying at Linnea appartment in Farsta Strand was perfect for me visting
Stockholm. Train/Tube connection is very well and Linnea's appartment is
spacious and nice, I enjoyed it. Linnea is a very friendly and concerned host, and this from the first contact immediately after reservation until leaving. Also I tried Linnea's bars session which have been for me an amazing experience. Strongly recommended!

1072,278311,2199174,2012-09-04,1373271,Daniel,"Linnéa was great!  Very good host.  The location was great just like everyone mentioned.  Metro was super close and it was convenient to have a Coop store (groceries, etc) that is open til 2200.  

I would definitely recommend Linnéa if you plan on staying in Stockholm."
1073,278311,2406569,2012-09-25,2879520,Roxanne,"Linnéa is a great host, really open minded and it is always fun to speak with. She is an amazing person. 

Her place is very near to the subway and it taxes less than 25 minutes to reach the central station and Gamla Stan (historical island).

You will enjoy your stay here! Thank you again for your nice being Linnéa :)"
1074,278311,2542726,2012-10-08,3497369,Antonis,"Linnéa  is a fantastic host and amazing person! It was so wonderful to live with her. We laughed so much, she helped me a lot, and I felt like living at my house! Subway and Coop are really close. Only few minutes!
The best of all is that i I got a new friend!!!
Tack så jätte mycket Linnéa!!"

Linnea is easy going and makes you feel comfortable, always smiling and happy, didn't have much time in my stay to get to know her more, but would definitely repeat my stay to do that :)
Thanks Linnea

Peace, relaxation, fun and ...
and if you want to know the rest come from Linnéa."
1077,278311,3156202,2012-12-25,4442495,Nathan,Linnéa is a beautiful soul. Her home is very clean & comfortable. It is also quite close to public transport. I would stay with her again & I would recommend her place to you.
1078,278311,3282372,2013-01-05,2525748,Zsolt,I stayed in Linnéa's place for a week and I can only recommend it to anyone who wants to spend some time in Stockholm. The apartment is close to the city central (20 minutes by train/metro) and has a supermarket nearby (a few minutes walk). Also Linnéa and Thomas were more than helpful.
1079,278311,3685866,2013-03-04,4878398,Lilli,"you can feel the positive energy from the very first moment you get in contact with linnéa and her clean, bright and 'clear' place feels like home from the moment you enter! "
1080,278311,3874909,2013-03-23,5378840,Patrick,Everything was great. I would recommend this place to anyone who said they are going to Stockholm. Unfortunately Linnea was not there herself but Enrico was there and he took good care as a host.  
1081,278311,3913369,2013-03-26,5510672,Melk,"Linnéa, a great soul, offered me to stay at her place.
She is trustful, her home so clean and beautiful, she coordinated me determined thru the airbnb ware-fare. I've got the chance to meet her great friends and had definitely an amazing time! Hope to meet you one day (again - what?)!"
1082,278311,4060578,2013-04-07,4365730,Julie,"I enjoyed my stay very much.Aalthough I didn't meet Linnea.,she was very helpful via email and her flatmate, Enrico, took very good care of me. The room was spacious and comfortable. I would clarify that the 16 minutes to the city center refers only to the time on the train. You have to walk 5 minutes to the station and if you miss a train, as I did, you may have to wait about 10 minutes for the next. "
1083,278311,4127917,2013-04-12,2404401,Nele,"I stayed three nights here and I really enjoyed!
It's a bit far from the city centre, so that may be a little bit inconvenient, but on the other hand: It's very quiet here and it's just five minutes walk to the underground and a supermarket.
I only met Linnéa briefly, but she seems to be a very nice person. I also had the opportunity to meet her two nice Italian friends!
And oh yes...the room is spacious and clean - so, just perfect!"
1084,278311,4252803,2013-04-22,5450665,Sarah,Linnea was an excellent host - we stayed with her for 3 nights during the first part of our trip in Sweden. Both Linnea and her house mates were very friendly and welcoming and the house was a calm and wholesome place to be. Lake and woodland very close by as well as direct transport links to the buzzing city centre. Linnea kept in frequent contact prior to our trip which enabled us to find the house very easily. We'd definitely recommend her!
1085,278311,4440756,2013-05-05,6167897,Emilio,"The stay over att Linne was awsome, she was a nice host and easy going as well. We got all the things that we needed even water from another world from her water time machine thing cool stuff idd. If you can take the metro to town give her a try. thx a lot for the stay linne it was fun. next time i can give that dance a go you never know :D best regards emilio "

1087,278311,4961616,2013-06-04,3927590,Erin,"We stayed 3 nights during our stay in Stockholm.
Location is nice and quiet and very easy to get to the city from the apartment, everyone was very helpful when navigating public transport :)
Linnea was a great host and made sure we had coffee and breakfast for our mornings before we would start our day.
The bed was amazingly comfortable and we both slept very well during our stay!

1088,278311,5366915,2013-06-26,6406639,Clinton,Linnea was an excellent host.  I really enjoyed my time in Stockholm because of her help and concern.  She is delightful and very talented in so many ways.  I would recommend her to anyone.
1089,278311,5646142,2013-07-09,3693537,Wouter,"A peacefull and harmonic place near nature  in Stockholm. That's what I experienced at Linnéa her place!
She is  social, love caring, helpfull and funny, I've got to know Linnéa in her being as she is, a beautifull  soul.
She's very openminded and easy going. Also met some of her closest friends and participated her groove class, it was wonderfull.
Linnéa is a great host! 
"
1090,278311,5739529,2013-07-14,6875180,Ravi Shankar,Linnea has been a wonderful host. very caring and co-operative. I felt at home staying at her place. She took care of the breakfast everyday and offered all utensils if I wanted to cook. She is simply a nice person and a wonderful guest.
1091,278311,6665885,2013-08-20,3346881,Alberto,"I spent four days at Linnea's house and I had a wonderful time. The house is big, my room was big and confortable too and the flat just reminded me of my times at university: the (Hidden by Airbnb) are young and handsome. And yes it's true, the house is near a wood and a lake and most of all is very easy to reach because is just three minutes walking from the last stop of the line 18 of the underground. I coudn't ask for more. As about Linnea, she's just nice and pretty, quite a sweet host. I recommend this choice."
1092,278311,7255148,2013-09-13,8263257,David,"I liked the big room with hangers for the clothes, the place is very quiet and clean. There is a food store 4 minutes from the appartment. Linnéa and her friends give useful advices to visit the best places in Stockholm.

Easy access to the metro station and peaceful area to run (managed to run 50 km in the neighborhood). Highly recommended!"
1096,278311,8791330,2013-11-18,9598018,Ilkka,"Linnea is a very nice person. I can sincerely recommend to stay at her place. Only minus for me was missing TV, but Linnea's personality and her spirit made it everything so easy and comfy.

1097,278311,14373786,2014-06-17,16035923,Jim,"Nice flat, nice room, nice bed, nice people, nice nature nearby - a couple mins by foot to forest park and about 5 more to the lake. Good recommendations of places to visit in the city from Linnea. Peaceful location. Easy to find. Recommended!"
1098,278311,17880406,2014-08-18,19383187,Lieven,"Leuk appartement in een rustige buurt.
Ik heb Linnéa niet ontmoet, jammer want zij geeft ook zweedse les.
Ideaal voor één persoon."
1099,278311,19047383,2014-09-05,20405468,Petros,"It was a real pleasure staying at Linnea’s place; the flat is located at a quiet residential area in south Stockholm within a very short walking distance from the Farsta Strand train station and is close to shops and other amenities. But that is not as important as many would think (though it clearly is an added plus!); what matters is that the place is a haven of friendliness and of calm energy. I had a string of extremely busy days in Stockholm during my booking, but always knew that the stress and pressure would go away as soon as I entered the flat and enjoyed some tea at the kitchen area or talked a bit with Linnea’s lovely family - big and small – that resided in one of the other rooms. The topics varied from the merits of fivefinger running shoes to barista ordering techniques, Swedish school curricula, Albanian dialects, welfare state reform, philosophy and life in Sweden in general… All in all, a positive experience at a place and with people that I could not recommend enough! "
1100,278311,35243089,2015-06-16,33629285,Susanne,"Die immerhin 10 Tage, die ich bei Linnéa verbracht habe, waren für mich eine wunderbare Zeit. Linnéa und ihr Zuhause hatten daran großen Anteil. 
Ausgewählt habe ich diese Unterkunft ursprünglich aufgrund der Beschreibung  ""Nature stay"". Und es stimmt. Die Wohnung liegt in einem ruhigen Wohngebiet ganz nahe an einem See und herrlich schöner Natur. 
Die Fahrt ins Zentrum ist unkompliziert, Metro-Station ist gleich um die Ecke. Auch die dort befindliche Einkaufsmöglichkeit ist praktisch.
Die Beschreibung war sehr genau und absolut zutreffend.
Linnéa selbst ist eine wunderbare Person und Gastgeberin, zu der man jederzeit mit Anliegen kommen kann, wenn etwas nicht passt - was aber nicht erforderlich war. Auch u.a. meine späte Abreise am letzten Tag war kein Thema. Deshalb:
Ein herzliches Dankeschön an Linnéa!
Alles wunderbar und absolut empfehlenswert!"
1101,278311,40211940,2015-07-29,12742120,Tammy,I enjoyed staying at Linnéa's home. She was very kind and her house was as described in her listing. It was a good location for exploring the city of Stockholm and the surrounding areas.  I slept very well there.
1102,278311,65726809,2016-03-16,9671505,Goo,"Nice young family with cute baby!  The house is situated away from the city as the listing says, but it is quite easy to go back and forth from the city, takes literally 30mins including the walk from metro/train. Linnéa lent me the spare transport card so i could top up with the 24 hours pass and that was convenient.

The walk up is easy but if you are arriving with a big luggage like me in winter time, be prepared for some pushing and rolling.

I didnt see much of Linnéa as she was away with baby, but her bf Arnando took good care of me and even bought breakfast items for me. They even recommended coffee spots for me as i am a coffee hunter, and all the suggestions were great!

House and room is big and surely enough space for two people. The trail literally behind the house around the lake is amazing and so is the nature area on the other side of the lake. Went for a nice walk and took me half an hour to get to the other side.

"
1103,278311,66302511,2016-03-20,2487043,David,"Linnéa was a fantastic host. I was staying for a few days with the intention of cramming in as much of Stockholm as I could. The apartment is in a great location. It's a really short work to the Metro as well as the beautiful lake (which was covered in a layer of snow on the first day of Spring!). The bed looked comfy and I can attest that it's even better than it looks. Towels and basic toiletries were a nice touch, though I didn't partake it was greatly appreciated and I imagine will be invaluable to those travelling light. She was also kind enough to offer breakfast (which I foolishly didn't realise and didn't make very much use of). Though I didn't see much of my hosts, they were kind and gracious to my comings and goings. Definitely beats a boring hotel! I just wish I could have stayed longer and chatted more."
1104,278311,69064941,2016-04-09,10174350,Rónán,The host canceled this reservation 33 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

I am glad I got to meet her and her beatiful baby Elder. Hope to see you again."
1106,278311,292456859,2018-07-18,41966202,Jing,A good place to stay in Stockholm. The host is super nice and friendly.
1107,278311,294007143,2018-07-21,61093387,Josh,I had Linnea's place to myself as she was staying somewhere else during my visit. The apartment is a good size and within about a 7 minute walk to the metro station. It takes about an hour to get into the main city of Stockholm (but there were train upgrades happening which made it a little slower). Linnea purchased some breakfast food for me to prepare in the mornings which was a nice perk. I would stay here again if visiting Stockholm another time. 
1108,278311,310316578,2018-08-19,203816250,Kamil,Women was very helpful and optimistyc too gest. 
1109,278311,326976972,2018-09-23,211500865,Miranda,"Had an incredible time at Linnéa. It´s close to everything you could ask for: close to nature, close to shoping & close to the green subway line, connecting Farsta to the rest of Stockholm. But the biggest highlight was the host herself. Kind & considerate, she made sure I felt at home the moment I stepped through the door. Overall: 10/10, would recommend."
1110,278311,330254072,2018-09-30,13573376,Fathima,Mycket nöjd med lägenheten i sig och med kommunikationen. Fantastiskt gott kaffe! Kul med leksaker som 3-åringen fick låna. Mycket uppskattat av henne!

1113,278311,524591795,2019-09-06,262479851,Melanie,When going to Stockholm look no further than Farsta. Honestly the area is (Website hidden by Airbnb) has a daily thriving colourful fruit and veg market encompassed by one big mall. You could easily lose yourself for half a day. It also has great transport links whether you want to head in town or out of town. The other side of Farsta boasts a beautiful park that sits on the edge of a huge lake. The cafe sells mouthwatering cakes. But the piece d resistance has to be the family we stayed with who were top notch hosts that were extremely helpful  with directions and places to see. You felt more like you were doing a homestay rather than Airbnb. Linnea lives in a lovely area and we would certainly come back for more
1114,283446,1622937,2012-07-03,2572009,Jasper,"Very friendly and generous family. Flexible, willing to help me out with anything (when I suggested I might get lost, they gave me one of their cell phones, and I could use a card for public transport in Stockholm). They made me feel very welcome and served excellent , fresh(not too spicy!!) Indian food and told about their lives and experiences. 
The surroundings of Akalla are surpringely beautiful, fields, forests, farm, all of it was near, as was the subway to Stockholm itself."
1115,283446,1635834,2012-07-05,2382760,The Hung,"We had a wonderful stay with Vidhatri family during our travel to Stockholm. Their apartment is large and clean and looks exactly the same pictures shown in the web. The apartment is located in a safe and quite area, and from their place you just need around 20 minute to reach central Stockholm by metro and easily to reach Arlanda airport using SL tickets. Therefore, I strongly recommend Vidhatri apt for your upcoming visit to Stockholm."
1116,283446,1692272,2012-07-12,2729775,Amir,"Vidhi and Bala are amazing hosts.
I felt at home from the first moment.

They are very helpful and generous. The internet access + washing machine access helped me a lot during my trip to Scandinavia as well.

Lovely family and a very nice place. The location is great too, because it's like one minute walking from the metro station, and from there it's really quick to get to the main attractions in Stockholm. 
Food was really good too.

It was my first Airbnb experience, and it was not less than an excellent one. I am really glad I stayed at Comfort Stay @ Stockholm - Kista IT."
1117,283446,1742451,2012-07-18,2842012,Julija (Julia),"Clean house, friendly and responsive host! We were welcomed with an Indian light dinner, what was a nice surprise and the host met us in the airport to guide to the appartment (since we arrived on Sunday), which was very helpful!
Some other helpful hints were provided, with many thanks for that!"
1118,283446,1784688,2012-07-23,1418776,Janel,"I stayed here for a few days before finding a longterm room for an internship in Stockholm.  Vidhatri and family were very welcoming and accommodating, and their hospitality was very helpful for my first few days in the city.  The breakfast and Indian food were also excellent (some of the best Indian food I've ever had)."
1119,283446,2056123,2012-08-21,2913595,Jürgen,"I can recommend the place to everybody who needs to stay in Stockholm for a few days but especially to future students.
Vidhatri was not only a very nice and obliging host but also helped me with finding an apartment.
I am completely content with my stay and will definitely come back whenever I need to stay in Stockholm"
1120,283446,2083468,2012-08-24,3071594,Teodora,"I've moved to Stockholm to study a master programme at the University. It is the first time I left home for such a long time and I thought it will be really hard for me to be far from the ones I care for, but Vidhatri made it really easy for me. She is just the perfect host ever! At her place I felt like being at home. She is so kind and it's a pleasure to stay and have a nice conversation at dinner or during the day at a cup of coffee. I really don't have to say that she is a great cook, because you will discover if you will chose this apartment. ( which it's really clean, cosy and only one minute away from the subway station ). If you need a place to stay in Stockholm I highly recommend Vidhatri's place."
1121,283446,2114703,2012-08-27,2806201,Rolando,She was very helpful and provided all the information that was needed and was friendly at all times. The stay was perfectly comfortable.
1122,283446,2245870,2012-09-10,2519458,Anselme,"Vidhatri was a very kind host who was willing to share her advice on places of interest. The accommodation was very clean and organized, the independent room was comfortable. The commute into the city was very convenient. It is near to city and Airport.  Ideal location for me.  I enjoyed her Special Indian Vegetarian food.  Delicious.  Yummy.. Highly recommended to stay here for your trip to Stockholm."
1123,283446,2290865,2012-09-14,1466849,Elling,"Vidhatri, her husband and teenage daughter are a really lovely family. They made me feel totally at home. She is a super quick communicator, very helpful, kind and considerate. 

The daughter is the resident chef, her cooking as good as her mother's, I just loved the Indian vegetarian food, I had breakfast and dinner every day. 

My room was very nice with a large double bed, plenty  of wardrobe space and a good desk for working. 

A very good experience in all respects and I have no hesitation recommending the room to other travelers. "
1124,283446,2303386,2012-09-17,3036006,Jelena,"Vidhatri and her family is very god, generous and kind host. They are an exceptionally nice mannered, openhanded and helpful family. Vidhatri sent us  very exact and detailed instruction to get to their home. They show us a great respect by preparing a homemade breakfasts and coffee every morning. We could choose and we used a chance to try Indian food. We loved it! This was our first Airbnb experience and it was very good one. Her apartment is few minutes from metro, so very well connected to the city center.

1125,283446,2409735,2012-09-25,3085540,Aseem,"Vidhatri was very accommodating and flexible, easy going, friendly, resourceful and helpful. We are all enjoyed delicious Indian Food. The space was wonderfully neat and clean, aesthetically pleasing, all your needs in one---and exactly what I needed!  The location was convenient to the city center using the metro or bus, and Vidhatri was very helpful about providing exact instructions on how to get to their apartment from the airport, and anywhere else I wanted to go. They are an exceptionally nice mannered, openhanded and helpful family. They are so helpfuly, they accompanied us all the way to the airport, unluckily the trains were stopped on our way to the airport, they helped us reached the airport on time.
I highly recommend staying with Vidhatri and her family and plan on doing so again when I return to Stockholm in the future.

1126,283446,2441548,2012-09-28,3469358,Jennifer,"My stay at Vidhatri's was great!  The whole family is so friendly and generous.  Right away I felt comfortable and welcomed, as I was offered a delicious home cooked vegetarian Indian meal with the family and great conversation. 
 
Regarding the accommodation, everything was very clean and the bed was very comfortable as well.  

The location was convenient to the city center using the metro or bus, and Vidhatri was very helpful about providing exact instructions on how to get to their apartment from the airpor, and anywhere else I wanted to go.  They also called the taxi company for me to reserve a car for my departure to the airport at 4am.

I highly recommend staying with Vidhatri and her family and plan on doing so again when I return to Stockholm in the future.    "
1127,283446,2484443,2012-10-02,123898,Pascal,"Staying at Vidhatri's apartment was great ! The family is very friendly and helpful for all kind of matters. The bedroom is spacious and equipped with a good bed, lots of wardrobe space and a desk (w/ Wifi). We chose indian breakfast, and did not regret it : we had different kinds of indian pancakes every morning, which were all very good ! We also ate at home one night : Vidhatri and her daughter Jessica teamed up to make this dinner a very enjoyable moment - both with food and conversation. We recommend staying at Vidhatri's home if you want to spend a few days in Stockholm, and we will do again if we come back. "
1128,283446,2523715,2012-10-06,2246902,Savneet,"It was a very pleasant and home-like stay with Vidhatri and family. From the first day itself, they treated me like house member. The room was tidy and good sized, with internet access, and even DVDs were offered with some interesting short films. :)  They also served fantastic dinner and we had quiet interesting conversations over the table with their family. Home cooked breakfast was a perfect start for day as well in Stockholm. Overall a very pleasant stay and highly recommended."
1129,283446,2619561,2012-10-15,3691017,Diego,"Grazie Vidhatri per la tua ospitalità, la stanza era ottima , la tua casa a due passi dalla metro ci ha dato la possibilità di godere a pieno il nostro soggiorno la zona è tranquilla e tu e la tua famiglia gentilissimi e molto ospitali.  Mi sono sentito a casa mia. un Abbraccio e a presto!"

this couple has got a talented daughter. "
1131,283446,2709526,2012-10-24,3747863,Jane,"The hosts made me feel right at home when I visited Stockholm. They came all the way to the port to pick me up when I got to Stockholm, and escorted me all the way to the airport when I had to leave. They let me use their bus/subway pass at a discounted price, and they cooked delicious and authentic Indian meals for me. The bed was super comfortable... (The first thing I did when I got to their home was take a nap.) They treated me like family, and they even planned out a schedule for me with a list of the places I should visit during my short stay in Stockholm. They also have a teenage daughter who is very friendly and knowledgeable of the top places to visit in Stockholm. I really enjoyed my stay at this place. Thank you so much! "
1132,283446,2752875,2012-10-29,3887007,Joseph,Vidhatri's place is very close to the public transit underground.  I found it to be very accessible and an easy way to explore Stockholm.  My hosts were very generous and offered to feed me more than my fill.  The room itself was a good size with a comfortable bed.  I enjoyed my stay.

They are good company always. Delicious food in lunch and dinner was ready before i woke up. Everything was just perfect for me. 
I would love to stay next time when i'm going to visit Stockholm. The best place ever. Feel as your home. Thank you so much again for everything."
1134,283446,2808533,2012-11-05,3247104,Shyam,"Vidhatri and her family are excellent host. During our stay of 2 nights, they treated us family member. We had long chats with them and enjoyed their fresh home cooked, Indian vegetarian food. Their apartment is at throw of stone from last stop of T station (Akalla). They helped us with information on city, best use of T service and airport transportation.

We recommend their apartment by airbnb members and we will surly use their facility, whenever we are in Stockholm. we wish them all the best."
1135,283446,2837122,2012-11-07,2421823,Tomasz,"Despite we booked Vidharti apartment and need to cancel the reservation on arrival, the host was very understanding and help us very much. She answered all our questions and later there was no problem with the refund. The communication with the host before and after the cancellation was very fast and friendly. We highly recommend Vidhardi and during our next (hopeful successful:) visit in Stockholm will stay in her apartment. See you soon!:)"
1136,283446,2934887,2012-11-21,2634030,Gemma,"I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a stay in Stockholm. Vidhatri and her family are all very lovely and helpful and the apartment is very close to the subway and bus stop, which makes it very easy to get around.

1137,283446,2996693,2012-11-30,4139684,Qurat Ul Ain,"I stayed with Vidhatri and Bala ji for two nights and I must say it was the best stay ever in another country. The couple is very sweet and helpful, helped me with all the bus numbers, routes and timings. Vidhatri ji made me the indian stuffed bread in breakfast, which was just delicious as any of the best indian restaurant. It was most comfortable stay. Even when I had to catch the bus at 2 am , Bala ji helped me finding the bus stop at that awkward time, which is so nice of him. I will always like to stay with tis family in a heartbeat whenever I will come to Stockholm visit. :)"

I recommend her, she is an excellent guide and a great host."
1142,283446,6231817,2013-08-04,7818328,Gösta,Vida and and her daughter were really nice and friendly hosts! They picked us (me&my girlfriend) up at the train station and cared about us. Breakfast was good and Vida alway offered us drinks and snacks! Vida answered all our questions to Stockholm. We recommend her homestay to anybody!

Definitely recommended :)"
1147,283446,6843318,2013-08-27,1865587,Bo,"I had a wonderful stay at Vidhatri and Bala's place. It was in a quiet location just a minute's walk from the metro station (2 minutes if you're slow). A 20 minute ride to center city, which was always the perfect length of time for me to plan out my day. And if you like Indian food, which I do, you're in for a treat - amazing food and great conversation as well! You'll never be hungry. I often had to skip lunch since I ate so much for breakfast, which was perfect since it allowed me more time to check out places in Stockholm. Most importantly of all, Vidhatri and Bala are just good people who really go out of their way to make your stay as enjoyable as possible. I would definitely recommend staying at their place, when it's available. Last but not least, if you enjoying running, there's hundreds of acres (if not thousands) of soft surface paths in a countryside setting right behind their place. I ran 12-18 kilometers a day when I was there and there always seemed to be new trails I haven't tested before. Always got the day started on the right footing!"
1148,283446,6927020,2013-08-30,201651,Lucie,We stayed two nights at vidha's place. A cozy place to stay! She is an amazing cook and such a kind person. Vidha and her husband were very helpful and gave us a lot of advices.

The room was nice, clean and big, and the location is convenient - only two minutes on foot to the underground station and then a direct twenty minute train to the centre. 

Breakfast was included in the stay, which is a wonderful convenience. Even better, they were happy to cater to my dietary requirements and made the most delicious vegan breakfasts. 

A very accommodating family, we would definitely stay again. "
1150,283446,19152107,2014-09-07,20139827,Svea,"A good choice for a stopover before heading to the airport. Easy transport connections. Nice open air walkways which are welcome before heading into long flights. Shops and restaurants conveniently a few steps away. Close to metro which has lifts if you have luggage. Neat, clean and tidy. Nice extra touch was the offer of use of a secure wifi connection. 
The area is a busy residential one so there may be some people noise - it didn't bother me but I am pretty travel robust."

My stay with the family was very memorable - convenience (few metres to T-bana, supermarket and variety of shops), homely stay and authentic freshly cooked Indian meals. Interaction with all family members was interesting and I already miss them. "

They invited me to home made lunch and were so polite to me. They gave the filing of been at home. They helped me with things which I had to sattle. They gave me the privacy and comfort that I like. The room is big and very comfortable with wide double bed. At night they invited me to a pizza and tea and in the morning they took care for my breakfast.  I really felt at home with their home hospitality.  Definitely a place that I will come back again. Very recommend

The room was spotlessly clean and so was the bathroom, and they invited me for deliciious Indian dinner. We chatted at the living room and I heard from them about their interesting experience of living in Sweden. Absolutely lovely couple with an upbeat, radiationg personalities. Bana called a taxi cab for me and got up with me at 4:30am to prepare sweet tea for me and wait with me for the cab downstairs. That was so kind of him. My stay in Stockholm was absolutely perfect thanks to Vidharti and Bana. "

1166,283446,32901459,2015-05-23,30281463,Narendra,"A nice welcome from Vidharti where one can find a home away from home. Vidharti is very active in any type of response either message or sms or phone call and you can get any possible help from her. I hope one can enjoy the stay with nice family.
What is described here one can find the same there. You will surely feel self as a part of family. If possible and get a chance don't miss the enjoyment of traditional food."
1167,283446,33156976,2015-05-25,32956766,Jade,"My friend and I stayed for three days at Vidhatri’s house and had a fantastic time. Vidhatri and her husband, Bala, are lovely warm people :) They helped us from the start before we came to Sweden, advising us on which tickets to buy at the airport and directions.
 
On arrival we were given homemade pancakes and waffles, and each morning we were given delicious homemade food at whatever time we woke up. We especially loved our Indian breakfast! Their daughter helped us decide which places to visit, and we were made to feel so welcome it felt like home.

The room is large and spacious – definitely big enough for two people – and the bed is so comfortable! Metro is a 2 minute walk away, and the all night metros at the weekend made this a convenient place close to the centre, but also quiet enough to get a good night’s sleep. The room is exactly as the description says. 

Thank you so much for having us! We loved Sweden and hope to see you again soon. Would definitely stay here again and recommend."
1168,283446,33418103,2015-05-27,8705511,Sagar,Vidhi and her husband were very friendly and helpful. They gave us good recommendations on places to visit in Stockholm and we very much appreciated the home cooked meals. Their home is a little outside the main city (about 30 min by train) but the train station is 2 min away and trains are fairly frequent. We would recommend their place for future travelers. 
1169,283446,33844403,2015-06-01,33303117,Hakim,"Séjour à Stockholm réussi grâce à Vidhatri...grande chambre, accueil chaleureux tout en laissant de l'espace, intérieur très propre et à 20 mn environ du centre en ligne directe. Beaucoup de bons conseils et d'aide (réservations, vérification  des horaires de la ligne de bus de nuit pour prendre mon avion) et de succulents repas indiens! je recommande vraiment, des ""good vibes"" :)"
1170,283446,34169450,2015-06-05,33743724,Michele,"The room is cozy with a nice view of the park. The apartment has two bedrooms, a livingroom, a kitchen, and one shared bathroom. You really could not ask for a better location, easy access to the metro and grocery store coupled with the best nature you could imagine just a short walk away with cows, horses, pigs, goats, hills, and beautiful pastures. But thats not even the main reason I would advise staying at this location. Vidhatri and her family are very amazing people. They were very kind to us throughout our entire stay and extremely helpful when it came to providing directios and advice. They also make very delicious indian food which was always a plus. If you do not like eating vegetarian or do not enjoy exploring other cultures then this may not be the place for you. We however are very fond of learning and experiencimg different cultures so this was great for us. Additionally, everyone in this family seemed to wake up early in the morning, which would make sense since the sun rises at 4 am in Sweden. So it helps if you also prefer to rise early in the morning. Overall we really enjoyed staying in Sweden and being emersed in nature which this location provides."

Everything went well, the apartment was super clean and the room had anything you need, incl. fast WIFI connection.

Bala is a pretty nice host and takes really care about the guests needs. Every morning, Bala prepared a fresh and delicious breakfast - thanks again!

I really recommend this comfort stay, next to Akalla Metro station (15 minutes from T-Centralen Stockholm) - pretty easy to go there!"

The room is as pictured. Their flat is very close to the metro stop and ~30 minutes away from city center. I had a great stay here and would come again! "

Location is also great, just a few minutes walk from Akalla station (20min from Central station) so it has easy access to everywhere. 
We had to leave her place really early morning but they were super kind enough to saw us off. I highly recommend you to stay her place if you come to Stockholm.

Vidhiと彼女の家族はとても親切で､素敵なｽﾄｯｸﾎﾙﾑでの時間を過ごすことができました｡駅からも徒歩4,5分と近く､ｽﾄｯｸﾎﾙﾑ中央駅からも直通の地下鉄で20分と場所もとても便利です｡困ったことがあれば親切に教えてくれるので朝早い飛行機でも安心でした｡とてもおすすめです!"

At the same time we enjoyed the trip very much with the help of Bala Sir who treated us as younger brothers.
They have given full freedom of using all the facilities at the home.
I have no more words to describe the Hospitality given by Bala Sir and Vidhatari Madam.
Thanks You again. You people were beyond our imagination."
1176,283446,36266257,2015-06-27,3202272,Barb,"I could not have asked for more considerate hosts than Vida trip and her family. Both she and her husband came by train and bus to the airport because the knew I was having some mobility problems and that was only the beginning. Vida try introduced me to South Indian cuisine, delicious.She accompanied  me to lovely gardens.

Both her and her husband were so generous, 
in so many ways. Vida trip is a teacher and taught me a lot about Swedish customs. 

It was an absolutely wonderful experience living with Vida trip and the rest of her family.

On the practical side, it is easy to get to their
home which is in a wonderful area. 

The room is adequate and the bed very comfortable.

1177,283446,37230139,2015-07-05,35031930,Chris,"Vidhatri and her family are incredibly friendly and treat you like family; the hospitality was amazing and the energy is full of mirth. You definitely will start your days in the mornings with a full stomach!  I have learned lots of Swedish culture and how to make South Indian food, and without staying at Vidhatri I believe I might not have had such an amazing experience in Stockholm. 

The location is VERY convenient! Only a three minute walk to the train station, and you can take it directly into the center of the city! The windows are huge and inviting in the kitchen area so you can have a morning stretch while looking at the stretches of nature before you.

Overall: very pleasant! I believe it is the ideal place to stay during your visit to Stockholm.

Thank you, Vidhatri! I will return again soon."

Vidhatri's husband Bala came and greeted me at the metro station, which was great. The room was spacious and clean, and I received a very warm welcome (with cookies and tea). Additionally, Vidhatri was kind enough to cook me dinner on my first day of arriving. The breakfasts everyday were great - South Indian homecooked food all the way in Sweden. The entire family is friendly and very helpful. Overall, it was a great stay and I would recommend this airbnb to others visiting Stockholm."

1202,283446,87997299,2016-07-22,64100775,Jeanette,Our hosts Vidhatri and Bala made us feel extremely welcome.

Enjoyed the vegetarian breakfast and dinner with varied menu each day. Breakfast was even ready for me when I arrived in the morning. Vidhi took the trouble to prepare breakfast before my early morning departure. She and her husband are friendly and warm hosts who made me feel at home right away, and spent time to chat with me. With positive reviews, they both still continue to strive to provide great care to their guests. It's very clear that they are passionate and dedicated in what they do."
1209,283446,97711831,2016-08-28,85984276,Carlos,"El señor Bala me recibio a una hora muy incoveniente. Sin embargo no creo que sea para todos quedarse con el. El señor Bala vive con su familia que es hindù. Es una cultura totalmente diferente a la mia (soy latino) y eso hizo que mi estancia con el, no fuera la mas comoda. El señor Bala es atento junto con su esposa Vidhi pero si no estas acostumbrado a ciertas cosas lo mejor es no quedarse con el. 
P.S
Yo acababa de llegar a estocolmo mi ingles no es lo mejor. Todo esos factores hicieron dificil la comunicacion. Es la primera vez que ocupo este servicio.  
El internet no funciono la mayoria del tiempo. Tuve que usar los datos de mi telefono."
1210,283446,98518804,2016-08-31,74059069,Nazir,"I had a lovely time at Ms Iyer's and Mr Bala's place. Mr Bala helped me immensely with directions and very courteously allowed me to reschedule my stay. In addition, they treated me like family. They never failed to prepare breakfast and dinner for me. I'm deeply appreciative of their warmth and generosity. Thanks for helping to make my trip to Stockholm a memorable one!"
1211,283446,154794137,2017-05-26,99237012,Jermaine,"Check in was great, Vidhatri was extra informative with instructions, pricing and logistics which was valuable. I was also given great instructions on places to eat. I was there for business and the football the stadium was only a few stops away on the train and the location of the train station was perfect. The apartment is also located next to a great park with animals and good for a walk or run. If you want to get to central Stockholm it is a distance that was the only negative but no fault of the hosts. The area was a little ""ghetto"" lots of young men hanging around and could be a little imposing if you are a female, again no fault of the hosts. 

Some good shops locally for food and bits and pieces. There is a pizza restaurant near by which is a football hub and good beer (no wifi) 

Hospitality was superb and it was great to taste some home made Indian breakfast. The bed could be more comfortable and more pillows provided but the room was great/tidy. The wifi was great too. "
1212,283446,155440322,2017-05-28,92591568,Joseph,"Great service and hospitality shown .Room was cozy for 2 ppl . Extremely tasty Breakfast n food given to us .(which was far exceeding our expectations)

The bed was comfy and having the balcony there for a meal outside was nice. Daniel was very friendly and made sure all of my questions were answered.

The balcony is a particularly nice feature because it opens up the space. We walked easily or used our SL card to get everywhere. Daniel is a very welcoming host and accommodated our need to arrive unexpectedly late at the apartment. We recommend staying here for anyone interested in easy access to sightseeing and to the Sodermalm area."

In this regard he was very helpful and friendly. Note that the apartment is very small, which is fine, but there is nowhere (literally) to unpack clothes as the apartment is full of Daniel's own belongings. But this was a minor inconvenience at worst, and I would happily recommend Daniel's apartment to others. We chose not to use the balcony in the cold and rain, but I think that in warmer weather this feature would be a real boon. "

1259,299154,11286966,2014-03-28,9274757,Olga,"HI! Daniel is nice, friendly and helpful. Thanks, Daniel ) Apartment cosy and has all we need. Daniel  allowed us arrive earlier and stay longer. It was very cose. The apartment is in the centre and in convenient place. We were four and all was grait! I recommend this apartment!"
1260,299154,11464706,2014-04-04,9522019,Chris,"What a wonderful time and fabulous place to stay Daniel was the perfect host and so accommodating. The beds were more comfortable than a Westin Heavenly Sleep, honestly (or maybe we were just too exhausted from a great day of the Palace, Nobel, Ikea.) Super location and perfect directions...and a fab hot shower. We would stay again and totally recommend."
1261,299154,11712099,2014-04-13,6459898,Yuliana,"Apartment is located close to Gamla Stan. Near many restaurants, cafes, shops. Daniel was accommodating. And he has a capsule-coffee with a delicious coffee;) We spent 3 days in Stockholm. The best impressions. I recommend this apartment."
1262,299154,11833997,2014-04-16,11909364,Candido,"El apartamento estaba en un sitio bastante céntrico, con buenas comunicaciones (estación de metro muy cercana). Las camas cómodas, aunque en un espacio muy reducido. El anfitrión fue muy amable."
1263,299154,12377320,2014-04-30,13913122,Thomas,Great stay at Daniel's place. Location was perfect to visit Stockholm and it has everything you could need and more. Neighborhood is alive and you'll find a lot of places to stop for shopping or having fika. Daniel gave us nice explanations when we arrived and we didn't required his help during the three days. Really good !
1264,299154,12876347,2014-05-13,9318203,Jim,"My husband and I loved the location of Daniel's apartment in Sodermalm. It was cozy but had all of the essentials. We thoroughly enjoyed the balcony. The street traffic, mostly bicycles and foot traffic, was always interesting. Daniel's space heater made this a usable area in early May. Most sites we wanted to see were within walking distance or an easy ride on the subway, about 1 minute away. The water pressure was strong and there was never a shortage of hot water. On are arrival Daniel gave us very good information about the neighborhood, stores, restaurants etc. We were delighted to find a bottle of sparkling wine in the fridge to celebrate the first night of our delightful honeymoon in Stockholm.  The unit was priced right for the week and met our complete expectations. We would definitely recommend this unit and would happily return. "
1265,299154,12967512,2014-05-16,893009,Chirag,A good neighbourhood with small but good rooms. A little small for a family of 4 but 2 people can comfortably stay. The neighbourhood quite good with slusen station a 2 minute walk.
1266,299154,13079028,2014-05-19,6470198,Marjan,"De flexibiliteit van Daniel is groot. Onze vlucht had vertraging waardoor onze aankomst erg laat was.  Dankzij de betrouwbaarheid van Daniel was de ontvangst vlekkeloos.  
Het appartement is volledig ingericht waarschijnlijk ook doordat Daniel zelf het appartement bewoont wanneer het niet verhuurt is. 
Qua locatie: perfect!  Midden in de relaxte Sodermalm, dichtbij metrostation Slussen en op loopafstand van Gamla Stan. "
1267,299154,13584874,2014-05-31,7503765,Valerie,"This apartment is in the perfect location. Daniel was very very helpful and accommodating about our trip.  It was a little small for two people (not a romantic couple), but the location made up for the size!  It is walking distance to plenty of restaurants and even the old city (Gamla Stan).  A great place to stay! "
1268,299154,13645330,2014-06-02,7275788,Steve,"Daniel was a very generous host. He met us and gave us plenty of information about the apartment and the neighborhood. While it is a small flat, for the two of us it was perfectly serviceable and its location made it a great choice. 5 minutes walk to the old city, 10 minutes walk to the Sofo district of bistros, cafes and night life. Public transport was within easy reach.  We spent one day wlaking around the old town and the northern area and then back to ""home"" without getting tired. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom quite large and the balcony was an excellent place to cool off. Certainly would recommend it to a couple visiting Stockholm."
1269,299154,13847778,2014-06-06,3727512,Anita,"The apartment is perfect situated in the center of  the bohemic Stocholm. Close to restaurangs, pubs etc. The underground station is just around the corner. The apartment is well equiped and extra nice with a big flatscreen. Well working wi-fi . The host very nice and easy to communicate with. When I had problem to manage the  TV he help me quickly. I can recommend this apartment."
1270,299154,14180009,2014-06-14,11967605,Jeff,I stayed here with two close friends and we found Daniel's apartment to be the perfect place to be in the middle of things in Sodermalm-day and night.  Daniel could not have done more for us and he proved to be responsive throughout the booking process and reliable at check-in.  An unreserved recommendation from us.  If you are in Stockholm you only need a place to lay your head for a few hours until you can get back out into the city and Daniels's place is perfect for that!
1271,299154,14770078,2014-06-26,4897995,Tanya,"Daniel and his place were both wonderful!  The location was fantastic - right in the middle of everything, with easy access to all of the places we wanted to go.  The surrounding shops and cafes were also great fun.  Daniel was very responsive and welcoming.  The only downside was that we had to get on a plane and come back to the real world eventually."
1272,299154,14899439,2014-06-29,5016480,Jennifer,Daniel's apartment is in a fantastic location.  It is right around the corner from a great street of restaurants and shops in Sodermalm.  It is also a very short walk (10 minutes) from Gamla Stan (old town).  Daniel was a great host.
1273,299154,15255900,2014-07-06,13894043,Kathy,"This apartment was in the absolutely best location for our visit! A couple minutes from Slussen train station and boat docks, and it was just over the bridge to the old city. It was very easy to get around to all the museums, archipelago boats, and everything in Gamla Stan. There was also a grocery store on the way from Slussen to the apartment and that was very helpful. 

Daniel really helped us with our trip. Although he was away on a business trip during our stay and we did not meet him personally, he was very responsive to any questions both before the trip and during. He arranged for a friend to be there to meet us and to be able to drop our bags off early before heading out to do some exploring. I was traveling with a work colleague and the apartment has 2 very comfortable beds—one appears to be ‘real’ and other is a couch fold-up that was much more sturdy and comfortable than regular couch pull-outs. 

The apartment is very small. I would say 2 people would be the most comfortable in that small space. There was a lot of Daniel’s stuff around and we had a hard time finding somewhere to put our basic things like toiletries, although there was a wardrobe with hangers. We could not be in the kitchen at the same time. And maybe it was just us and technology, but we could not get the TV to work to see the World Cup. That said, we were not in the apartment very much and having a kitchen for dinners after long days of sightseeing and day trips was terrific. There is a little deck that is lovely in the evenings. I would say if you just need a place to sleep, maybe prepare a couple of meals for some downtime, and want to be close to everything fun in Stockholm, this is a great apartment. Daniel did everything he could to make us feel welcome. 
"
1274,299154,15399375,2014-07-08,15093692,Jacob Westy,"The apartment was as expected, cosy small and furnished in a good practical way. Very nice and personally. We met Daniel twice, when we arrived and later on when he very quickly came with a new coffemashine. Good machine and good coffee too. We appriciated the little balcony and the uppermadras for the sofabed. The road was more quiet than expected, only a few cars are passing. If it hasn't been for the good weather and the balcony the appartment is a little to small for 3 grown ups. Our grown up son (20) was very fond of the decor. Every thing works in the appartment. Daniel is a very reliable and pleasant host."
1275,299154,15676496,2014-07-14,14761378,Teo,"My family and I had a great stay at Daniel's apartment. It was very cosy and well equipped. Very accessible, T-bana station is just right beside. Daniel made sure that we knew everything before he left us and even gave us some good restaurant  recommendations. 

We would definitely recommend Daniel's apartment to anyone."
1276,299154,16820073,2014-08-03,12276619,Cathy,"Apartment is in a fantastic position very near metro. Gotgaten has some lovely restaurants and bars and there is a great bakery just round the corner - try the Cardomen buns! My husband and I really enjoyed sitting on the balcony in the evening sun, with a beer."
1277,299154,17199315,2014-08-09,12085226,Mercedes,"Daniel was very friendly and explained how everything in the apartment worked.  The location was amazing, so easy to get everywhere.  The apartment was clean and ready to go.  Would recommend."

1279,299154,18400455,2014-08-26,15067081,Paul & Colleen,"Daniel was so welcoming and explained the layout of the place and how everything worked. He had a folder in English, as a backup plus we had his phone #if needed.
The location was great and area was accurately described on website. The apartment was very small but adequate. The bed was very comfy. "
1280,299154,18514816,2014-08-28,10452666,Olka,"We like this place very much! The apartment is really cozy, it is nice to stay on the balcony and to look on town-living. It is the best location!
Daniel is friendly and helpful."
1281,299154,18789179,2014-09-01,15005969,Liz,"Daniel was a friendly host, the location of the apartment was ideal (seconds from the T-Bana, walk to Gamla Stan and the Djurgården ferry). We were in town for a music festival and being able to come back to a comfortable bed and hot, powerful shower was the best!! Oh and the balcony was perfection! We ate out there every day!"
1282,299154,18902709,2014-09-02,4315917,Marjolein,The apartment was good located. Close to the metrostation Slussen. Daniel was really helpful. We didn't meet him but he indicated everything  very good. It was easy to communicate with him. The flat was clean and it's a cosy place.
1283,299154,19113617,2014-09-06,7727913,Maria,"My friend and I stayed at Daniel's place for one night and we found it very accommodating. We were drawn by the neighborhood and we truly enjoyed being there - it was so close to several train stations, shopping, trendy restaurants and boutiques. This was a no-frills place and we would definitely stay again. "
1284,299154,19263125,2014-09-09,3644965,Stephen,We had a fantastic few days in Stockholm and the location of Daniel's apartment couldn't have been better.  You have everything you need on your doorstep. The apartment is small but it is clean and was perfect for my friend and I. Daniel answered all my questions before I arrived and communicates very well and quickly.  Perfect if you're just looking somewhere clean to sleep at night while you explore the beautiful city of Stockholm. I would definitely stay again.
1285,299154,19333285,2014-09-10,18768922,Cassandra,"My husband and I enjoyed our quick stay at Daniel's apartment.  Daniel was so considerate, having prepared a city guide for us. He was responsive to my messages during our stay. 

Daniel's apartment location is ridiculously convenient: a few steps away from the Slussen subway station, coffee, food, shopping and walking trails for a beautiful view across the Riddarfjärden. Close to Götgatan and a quick subway ride to Gamlastan. 

The apartment balcony is lovely for people-watching. 

Thanks for your hospitality, Daniel! We love your place!"
1286,299154,19511107,2014-09-14,14879121,Natascha,"Daniel war wirklich sehr freundlich, er gab sich Mühe, dass wir sogar früher in das Appartment gehen konnten, da wir schon so früh angekommen waren.
Das Appartment aber, ist zwar sehr gut gelegen und gemütlich aber für 4 Personnen fast ein wenig zu klein."
1287,299154,19739811,2014-09-17,10891115,Morgen,Daniel was very communicative prior to arrival and really went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed.  The lists of places of interests/restaurants/grocery stores was very very handy!  the apartment was exactly as described and even easier and more convenient than I thought it would be!  His flat will be me first thought on my next visit to Stockholm.
1288,299154,19816393,2014-09-19,15960954,Suzanne,The location of Daniels apartment is perfect for the tourist.  We found the building to be quiet and friendly.  Daniel is friendly and helpful.

Vi var fire gæster og der var gode sovepladser til alle. 
Lejligheden er lidt lille men passede fint til vores behov. 
Vi måtte ændre planer på ankomstdagen, men Daniel var fleksibel så alt løste sig uden problemer. Daniel tilbød at vise os området, men vi klarede os på egen hånd. "
1292,299154,20927605,2014-10-07,6472334,Matthew,"The apartment was cosy and convenient, Daniel takes his hosting duties seriously and this means added convenience and comfort for his guests. "

I would totally recommend staying with Daniel! "

Daniel was a good host and was easy to communicate with.  He was flexible with check in and check out times and answered any questions we had via email promptly during our stay.

Daniels studio is cosy but very comfortable.  We would definitely stay again."

flat was great, location is very easy and near to everything especially metro station.
its true that many shops around the building with some coffee shops and supermarket.
Daniel offered us to use the kitchen tools and spices, i would like to thank him soooooo much because of the coffee and two eggs we used for kids :)
i strongly recommend this flat and the great host.

1307,299154,23570268,2014-12-05,2198139,Kristina,Dan was an awesome and a very considerate host.  My parents stayed at his place for a couple of days and loved it.  The location was perfect and the apartment was big and very comfortable.  Makes me want to come visit Stockholm and stay there!

1310,299154,24158707,2014-12-21,11021412,Christina,"Perfect host!
Perfect location!
Couldn't have been better!
I would stay here again. I'd love to come back in the summer and enjoy the balcony.
Daniel is truly a sweet, honest and all-around great guy! He communicated promptly and clearly, and was very accommodating and flexible in dates.

All true about the location - this is truly in the heart of hip & trendy & busy & fun Götgatsbacken. 
We were so busy exploring the neighborhood - on foot - that we had no time to enjoy the big screen TV in the flat.
It was surprisingly quiet for a neighborhood with so many cafés, restaurants and bars.
We slept well, saved money and ate well by cooking in Daniel's well-equipped compact kitchen. The grocery store ""Matrebellerna"" just around the corner was well stocked. 
Free and fast wifi as well.
Thank you!"
1311,299154,24350346,2014-12-26,12986660,Maikel,Samen met vrienden een heerlijk verblijf gehad in Stockholm. Appartement heel bereikbaar en in een leuke buurt. Bedankt Daniel
1312,299154,25149463,2015-01-07,11091687,Alexander,"Квартира отлично расположена, до Гамластана идти несколько минут, до ближайшей станции метро пару минут. Дэниел быстренько показал что где и предоставил нас самим себе, но предложил обращаться к нему с вопросами по любым поводам. В квартиры был хороший WiFi, а также путеводители и распечатки с описанием мест вокруг. Последнее оказалось довольно удобным."
1313,299154,25188451,2015-01-08,22777243,Emilio,"Daniel was incredibly welcoming and organized. The apartment was very well kept and clean. Daniel even laid out some chocolates and city guides for us (as well as some printouts of places he recommended). Overall, this was a fantastic experience and I would absolutely recommend staying at Daniel's lovely apartment."
1314,299154,25693798,2015-01-23,26011680,Boris,"This was a most amazing hospitality I saw, actually never seeing the host. We kept meeting little notes here and there, which explained everything we needed to know about the apartment, Stockholm, Sweden and the whole world. Well, kidding about the last one, but, really, the lore was comprehending, we will now check out the bookstores for his Stockholm Guide, so much worthy his guidelines about life in Södermalm's region are. I skip the delicate part of how flexible he is as a host about various aspects any traveler might want to flex. And being most generous towards our egotistic manners was just one more precious quality of him, amidst whole a lot. Besides, we learned a couple tricks, which let us enter civilized society from now on,  so no more leaving the key under the floor mat, after all. Stockholm in Daniel's edition is great, what more can I say?"
1315,299154,25750849,2015-01-25,25227329,Chris,"Small but very cleverly laid out and high spec apartment. Daniel was a great host: friendly, efficient and very helpful."

The appartement is perfectly located in Stockholm, in Söder with walking distance to Gamla Stan and really near tube station. The apartment is exactly as described in the description, and we got everything we needed ! Thank you Daniel !

1330,299154,30349819,2015-04-20,27982884,Emilio,"Daniel’s flat is very well located, a good starting point to visit Stockholm by walking, getting back to rest if you need it; groceries and pubs round the corner.
The flat is as described, there is everything you can need. It’s a studio flat, the size is perfect for two people, ok for four friends. No problem with the organization (Daniel was waiting us, etc.)
Recommended to people who are visiting the city as a tourist

1331,299154,30556887,2015-04-24,11132252,Rensie,Thank you Daniel for sharing your place. It was very convenient and is located near bus stops and train station. We were able to check in early too. Thank you for meeting us even though you were not feeling well.

All the information was available from login details to places to eat.  Great response to questions and sms.  The flat is very central, walking distance from Gamlastan and located in the middle of a very vibrant Sodermalm.  Excellent choice, can recommend the place and would stay here again!"
1334,299154,31630843,2015-05-08,23430230,Jane,"Stayed here with a friend in May. The location was perfect for us, and Daniel was very organized and accommodating. We would stay here again!"

1336,299154,32360980,2015-05-17,2696494,Dan,"The apartment is really well arranged and spacious even for 4 grown ups. It has all the things you would need including a cozy balcony perfect for chilling late in the evening after a busy day.

The location is perfect for walking around the most hip parts of town. It was actually the main reason for choosing it over everything else as, not only you save up money from the public transportation, but also are close to lots of pubs, cafes and restaurants.

As for the host, Daniel was very friendly and flexible with the checkin/out times. Getting the keys and leaving the apartment was smooth. My friends and I had a great time here."
1337,299154,32609274,2015-05-19,20295729,John,Daniels place was awesome.  Very close to public transportation and the located in the cool part of Stockholm.  The place was very clean and well appointed.  He was extremely helpful in squaring us away both at his place and with the location.  About a black away is a bar with live music and the best Mussels and cheeseburger I have ever had.  
1338,299154,32732184,2015-05-20,33550378,Brian,Daniels house is cozy and excellently located. We had a wonderful time in Stockholm and this apartment was one of the main reasons! Daniel met us at the apartment and welcomed us warmly. We would definitely stay again!

1340,299154,33065322,2015-05-25,3392814,Sandy,"This tiny apartment is the perfect place to visit and see Stockholm, the neighborhood is fantastic with the walking street just around the corner and only a 10 minute walk across the bridge to the old town.  Daniel was very welcoming and making contact with him went as smooth as it could be.   Although the apartment says it is for 4 people, and it will sleep four people fairly comfortably the apartment was so small that it was very difficult to find room for luggage for 3 people.  I would highly recommend this place for 1 or 2 people."
1341,299154,33363317,2015-05-27,20853029,Shelsy,Daniel's apartment was at an amazing location and I only wish I could have stayed longer! The apartment is spacious and comfy! We didn't get to meet Daniel but he was super through and made sure we had a way in! 
1342,299154,34060280,2015-06-04,30002588,Maria,"Daniel was out of town but kindly made arrangements with his friendly neighbor Rolf to help us get settled. Everything went smoothly, and the location close to the subway and old town could not have been better. It was a small studio, but one person on the sofa and one on the bed worked just fine. He left us lots of recommendations and guide books -- very helpful."
1343,299154,34881672,2015-06-13,7118925,Sanden,"Daniel is the real deal. A nice guy with a nice flat. Small but cozy, right in the heart of the coolest part of Stockholm: this place is ideal. We enjoyed the flat and neighborhood and recommend it to everyone."
1344,299154,35073753,2015-06-15,20559850,Domenick,"Great apartment in the perfect neighborhood. Daniel was a very accommodating host, which came in handy following multiple airline delays. The apartment was small, but perfect for two people. The balcony was clutch."
1345,299154,35368634,2015-06-18,21263615,Kari,"The location of this apartment is excellent for exploring Stockholm. It is easy to find and has everything you need within walking distance - subway, shops, restaurants, and cafes. Daniel met us at the apartment, showed us around, and answered any questions we had. He was very kind and helpful. There were 4 of us (2 adults and 2 kids) and it was a tight fit for us and all of our luggage, but it worked perfectly for us. Access to Wifi was great and I appreciated all of Daniel's guide books and helpful information. We had everything we needed and enjoyed our stay. Before our stay, Daniel was always very fast at responding to any emails and texts."
1346,299154,35910364,2015-06-23,5896924,Dora,"Daniel fue muy amable, nos recibió y nos dio indicaciones muy importantes, el departamento es pequeño pero confortable, bien equipado, gente un precioso balcón Está ubicado en una zona privilegiada, muy bien comunicado m es muy fácil pasear por Estocolmo desde allí, la zona tiene una linea movida. Sodermalm es un barrio muy muy lindo y esta a minutos de Gamla Stan. Muy recomendable"
1347,299154,36267332,2015-06-27,29759452,Helene Ring,"We were so lucky to have Daniel's appartement be our first AirBnb experience; what a great start. Daniel was so fast at answering our request to stay in the apartment, our questions in advance and messages while we were in the apartment. Such a nice, funny and good guy.

The apartment is brilliantly layed out and decorated. So cleverly done and bigger than I thought from the photo. Other then that it looks exactly as the photos. Clean and cosy made us feel at home right away. Real character. BIG nice TV and a threat to have Netflix :) Nice soft bed.

The location is PERFECT. I twisted my ankle the week before we went, so it was so good to be able to quickly get back home for a little rest before going out again for more experiences. Lots of nice shops in the neighbourhood, very short to the subway/bus etc. and very good to have the opportunity to go outside on the balcony. 

We are all ready planning our next trip :) Maybe just before Christmas, I can imagine Gamla Stan must be such a wonderland then. Perfect place for romantic walks in the summer too. "
1348,299154,37278722,2015-07-06,20195501,Dexter,"We stayed 4 persons in Daniels apartment, and it was a lovely experience.

The apartment has a balcony which was great for having a picnic and people watching on Gotgarten. Daniel was really helpful and made some phone calls for us when we didn't have a phone card. Thanks Daniel, a lovely stay!"
1352,299154,38657296,2015-07-17,37788566,Josephine,"En super hyggelig lejlighed med en perfekt placering. Mange butikker og caféer lige om hjørnet! Lejligheden var ret lille, men vi var kun to personer, så det fungerede rigtig godt. Og der var en fantastisk altan som vi nød godt af!"

Daniel gave us a thorough introduction of his apartment and also had a First Aid Kit available for us to use, which incidentally we ended up having to use."

1357,299154,40313465,2015-07-30,29797744,Catherine,"Daniel was a fantastic host.  The apartment was perfect and in the best location possible.  It's close to everything and lots of good restaurants and shopping.  Although it was a small apartment, it was very efficient and room enough for a family of 4.  Fast wi fi, clean and good amenities.  Daniel provided a lot of very useful info and very responsive to all our needs.  He was flexible and accommodating.  Thank you for having us in your apartment. Recommend it highly!"
1358,299154,40543859,2015-07-31,12989064,Nicky,Daniel is very friendly and helpful with all our questions. He is also flexible on check-in and check-out time according to our request. His place is cosy with all essentials. It is a perfect location in Södermalm for those who want to easily explore Stockholm but don't want to stay in the busiest area.  We were very happy and satisfied with our stay. We love walking around along Götgatan and Gamla stan which is just a few minutes from Daniel's place. I would love to stay in his place again next time I visit Stockholm and I highly recommend Daniel's place!

I know we will try to stay here again next time we are in Stockholm!"
1362,299154,42286315,2015-08-12,36283401,Alexis,Great location for our short stay in Stockholm. We enjoyed the neighborhood restaurants and the proximity to Gamla Stan and other attractions.
1363,299154,42519798,2015-08-14,29951607,Annette,Very well located in beautiful Södermalm. For our 4-headed family it was very small though - especially since we had a lot of luggage. Good luck the weather was nice so we could use the balcony and spend most of the time outside. Sleeping on bed and sofa was very comfortable and the kids loved the huge TV! ;)
1364,299154,42961326,2015-08-16,36768162,Oda,We had a great stay! The location was perfect and the apartment had everything we needed. Would definitely stay here again!

The apartment is very close to Gamla Stan (Downtown) and was easy to reach by metro.
Apartment was a little bit smaller than what I thought but fit well our group (3 persons).
I would be there again!"

Although Daniel didn't meet us on our arrival he had arranged for a friend to give us the keys and we had no issues. We experienced a delay in our arrival and this was handled perfectly.
Overall the apartment was great and the location was exceptional!
Thank you for a great stay!"

There are lots of restaurants and bars in the immediate vicinity, but walking to Gamla Stan and even further to Norrmalm was quick and easy.  

The only negative I have is that when we arrived, the bed was not made up for us.  Nothing is more of a downer than arriving on your vacation and finding out that you have to make the bed!  Maybe in the future that could be done in advance of the guest.  :)"

The apartment is located in an amazing place just nearby the old town but though a bit far from the central railway station. 
The neighborhood is nice and lively, all of the groceries can be gotten easily with a lot of other restaurants.
From inside, it was a bit small for 4 people, a lot of stuff that we did not need, but it was clean.
Overall, our stay was amazing.

Die Wohnung ist klein uns schnucklig und mit viel schwedischem Charme ausgestattet. Alles war sauber und angenehm, der Balkon ist auch im Herbst ein Pluspunkt. Für uns ein wunderbares Zuhause. Von der Wohnug aus ist in Stockholm alles bequem zu erreichen. Der Hauptbahnhof auch zu Fuss oder zwei Stationen mit der U-Bahn. Das Stadtviertel bietet alles was man zum Leben braucht.

His apartment is nice and cosy situated in quite a central way in Stockholm, next to a shopping street with nice boutiques. The room is small, but good enough for me as a business traveller that just wanted to have a bed to sleep on and an internet connection to do some work. I would definitely come back!"
1404,299154,56327537,2015-12-12,47178916,Aisyah,Daniel is reachable both by texts and website making it easier for us to talk to him. He is super friendly and the house was so great we wish we can stay longer. The location was perfect and easy to reach by public transport. We love it there !!
1405,299154,56409829,2015-12-13,1610312,Yukiko,"Fantastic location - 3 min from  Slussen metro station can not be better.  Daniel is always so quick to response and very informative. The locked box for the house key was excellent idea! He was very helpful, flexible and absolutely recommended.  "

1407,299154,56863602,2015-12-19,31325769,Niklas,Fin liten lägenhet med perfekt läge på Södermalm. T-bana och matbutik runt hörnet. 
1408,299154,57096343,2015-12-21,39261683,Mike,"Thanks for the apartment Daniel - everything as expected and perfect for an overnight stay.  Great to be back in Sodermalm and soak up the atmosphere again!  Too short a visit but I am sure I shall be back.

All the best

1409,299154,57318048,2015-12-24,47312146,Michael,Good location and the privilege of having the whole apartment to yourself. Nice decor!
1410,299154,57812229,2015-12-29,47700386,Rowena,"The location of the apartment is ideal, just 2 metro stops away from the central station and minutes of walk away from Gamla Stan. Daniel met us in the apartment to hand us the keys and also gave a few tips on what to do in Stockholm. Apartment is cosy and nice to stay in, except cause the toilet flush wasn't working well or smthg so there was an unpleasant smell, but otherwise the apartment is fine :)"
1411,299154,58152176,2016-01-01,25430516,Clifford,"Nice place, very well located. A little small for three people but it had everything we needed. Daniel was very helpful and specific with everything we needed to find the apartment and so on. "
1412,299154,58972356,2016-01-05,7594614,Oscar,"We are a couple that decided to go to Stockholm for 5 days.

When we arrived (later than we expected), Daniel was already in the flat ready to tell us all the tricks about the apartment. The apartment was tidy and with all comodities. It is small but functional, warm enough and the most important, in a perfect location with 2 minutes walk to Slussen and 5 minutes to Gamla Stan.

We did a lot of cooking in the kitchen, again, small but functional. Just arrived we went to the pizza place just one step far from the apartment! :) You can buy in the super markets close to Slussen or Coop 5 minutes walking.

The information in the web was more than enough to arrive easily to the apartment.

It made possible to enjoy our time in Stockholm to the maximum, I really recommend this apartment if you have the chance!"
1413,299154,59443886,2016-01-10,47856943,Åke,Daniel höll kontakten med mig och ordnade allt enlig mina önskemål. Det är mycket mycket bra bra att bo i det här boendet med Daniel som värd.
1414,299154,60213752,2016-01-20,47269580,Rafika,"Daniel's apartment is in very good location. 2mins walk from metro, or if you want to walk from Stockholm cemtral should take around 20 mins. The apartment itself is cozy. The balcony and big TV are one of the nice feature. Daniel is also very easy to be contacted. He is very nice and helpful as well. Renting his apartment is indeed make my vacation in Stockholm even better."
1415,299154,61060217,2016-01-31,53127688,Christine,"We booked Daniels apartment for a sister weekend in Stockholm. For three people this apartment is very little but absolutely sufficient. It has all you need. More important for us was the location. Gamla Stan is just a few minutes walk away. A MUST-DO is the Montäliusvägen which is also in walking distance. For breakfast we have been to the café ""Muggen"" round the corner - perfect. There are several cafés, bars, restaurants in short distance. Daniels tipps were very useful. 
It was very nice, that Daniel welcomed us personally. So we had the possibility to ask questions. Another point that was important to us was WIFI which worked perfectly.
Tack sa mycket för allt."
1416,299154,63231521,2016-02-21,21713358,Luc,"Daniel was very kind to wait for us after 11pm as we arrived late at the airport. The apartment was nice and tidy, the location is superb and we had everything we need. Way to go Daniel, if I come back in Stockholm, I'll definitely consider coming back here."

1418,299154,64682966,2016-03-06,45311863,Robert,"Daniel's home was great. The beds were very comfortable and fit us more than easily. Location is perfect. Despite delays on our flight (on a Friday), Daniel coordinated and made sure we got into his place easily. Definitely would stay here again."
1419,299154,65380137,2016-03-13,42203633,Solveig,Great experience with Daniel! Very personable and helpful.
1420,299154,66224543,2016-03-20,457450,Kelly,"Daniel very kindly welcomed us at his apartment, and shared some helpful tips about the neighborhood. The apartment itself was cozy and homey, and made for a good home-base during our weekend in Stockholm. The highlight, of course, was the location. Not far from the Slussen metro station, it allows one to get quickly and easily to Gamla Stan and much of the best Södermalm has to offer."
1421,299154,67233863,2016-03-27,35860155,Nada,"It's really great location, surrounded by many bars, shops, cafeterias.
The apartment is cozy but not well cleaned and the bathroom is in bad shape/extremely unpleasant smell all the time.
"
1422,299154,67697695,2016-03-30,26080646,Zane,"Daniel was very communicative and friendly. It was easy to get to the apartment, and getting the keys was very smooth. The balcony was a nice place to kill some time, and the WiFi is indeed quite fast. The kitchen and bathroom were both uncomfortably dingy, but perhaps there wasn't enough time to take care after the previous guests."
1423,299154,68929611,2016-04-07,60127222,Victoria,"Our stay in Daniels apartment was perfect. Regarding the smell someone mentioned, just pour water in the bathroom sink and the smell will eventually disappear! 
I really recommend renting this apartment, it's central and close to everything you might need or want to see. The neighborhood is 
really cozy! 
Daniel was very kind and welcoming when we arrived and gave us some tips on how to get where we were headed the next day. 
Would definitely rent this again!"

He had a guide to Södermalm and the apartment is in the middle of a ton. Super great location to Slussen and the building was really nice. All in all, great stay."
1426,299154,70616459,2016-04-19,30883227,Leanne,"Daniels apartment was great.  It had everything I needed, was close to the metro and lots of cafes and shops.  It was an easy walk into Gamla Stan and Central Stockholm.  Daniel was very welcoming and happy to help if needed."

It was very easy to get around the city from the apartment and Daniel gave us some great advice about sights to see. The bathroom was a little smelly at times but the living space and location overall made the stay worth it. 
1428,299154,71549343,2016-04-26,1089527,Stephen,Great neighbourhood. Daniel was very responsive and there when we arrived. He updated us regularly about checking in early if possible.

The host is kind and helpful, although I did not face any problems with the house. It is ideal for one person or a couple and I would recommend to anyone visiting the city either for a short or a long time."
1431,299154,72992101,2016-05-06,759015,Sophie,"We were lucky enough to arrange an early check in as it was a public holiday in Stockholm. Daniel showed us around his apartment and was easily contactable during our stay (we didn't need to get in touch as we had no problems.) 

His apartment was cosy for 3 of us (2 on double bed and 1 on sofa.) It was only a 3 minute walk to the metro 3-5 minutes to bus stops. Great neighbourhood too. 

We would definitely stay again! "
1432,299154,73380144,2016-05-08,42300913,Leighanne,"Daniel was there to greet us and show us around,  explain any tips and travel places too"

Daniel helped us out by letting us leave our bags, made sure the place was super clean and he was easy to deal with. His studio apartment had everything we needed. Was cosy for two couples, but comfortable for a short stay. I'd love to stay there again! "
1437,299154,74934855,2016-05-17,4851180,Bjørn,"Leiligheten var sentralt plassert på Søder, og var liten, lett, overmøblert, ren og perfekt et kort opphold. Daniel var en glimrende og grei vert.  "

I got everything what I needed for my stay. The conversation with Daniel was smooth and pleasant. He came to his appointments carefully. The decor of the apartment is not luxurious, but I liked it."

He had kept everything in apartment before we come "
1442,299154,77124799,2016-05-30,2135570,Christa Lei,"Clean, efficient and very close to the Slussen T-Bana, daniel's place is right in the middle of it all without being too hectic! It's literally seconds away from the busy shopping street of Gotgatan, and Daniel was communicative and helpful the entire time. His place was cozy and perfect for a couple. While he can accommodate more, it may be a bit snug for those who enjoy privacy (therefore perfect for a solo traveller or a couple, like us.) we very much loved our stay and Daniel had tons of recommendations!"
1443,299154,77507575,2016-06-01,24193925,Birgitte,Daniels avslappede ettroms ligger perfekt til på Söder. Fra balkongen kan man kikke rett bort på livlige Götgatan. Bakeri om hjørnet. Hyggelige Mosebacke ligger også like ved. Gangavstand til det meste!

The location was amazing, the beds were good (but irritating to my friend with a dust allergy), and it worked well for us. Also, I forgot my jacket after checking out and Daniel went out of his way to come home and unlock the door for us, which was very generous. Overall, it was a comfortable and nice apartment and the location was perfect!  "

1452,299154,81163454,2016-06-21,45522535,Mauricio,Place was well located and very close to restaurants and down town (10 minutes walk). Communication was easy and Daniel was helpful. Good experience
1453,299154,81384260,2016-06-22,44882403,Ya-Chi,"Daniel's apartment is in a great location in Södermalm within an easy walk to Gamla Stan and quick subway travel to Central Stockholm. Daniel's Södermalm neighborhood also has lots to see and do, and his guidebook is very helpful in identifying parks, grocery stores and restaurants in the immediate vicinity. 

Daniel's is apartment is very compact, as he accurately describes, but it works perfectly. We fit three people on the two beds comfortably and still had room to maneuver around the small studio apartment. 

Daniel was also a great host, providing clear communication and prompt responses to our questions. Although we did not get to meet him directly, he was very accommodating with our arrival schedule, and we found the information he provided online and in the apartment very helpful.

Thanks for a wonderful stay in Stockholm!"

Daniel is great communication and is very well organized. The apartment is in a great part of town. Right where you want to be if you visit Stockholm. 
1473,299154,96471213,2016-08-23,45024001,Cory,"Daniel's place was very nice. It is right in the heart of Sodermalm, and within easy walking distance to a metro stop. Daniel communicated very promptly with me, and was consistently helpful before, during, and after my stay. His apartment is well-kept, easy to access, and unique. I would definitely recommend his place to future travelers visiting Stockholm. "
1474,299154,97285632,2016-08-26,19367168,Bonnie,"Daniel's apartment is situated in Södermalm close to great shopping and food, and the Slussen station. Gamla Stan and even Djurgarden are in walking distance. The location is convenient and fine if you spend a lot of time out, but the kitchen is quite cramped and dark. The bed is soft if you like that, it was comfortable enough to sleep. Daniel's apartment has lots of his things so it can feel a bit cluttered but he is a responsive and reliable host."

His city studio (suited very well for 2 people) is so cute and cozy and in the very best location--close to everything we wanted to see/do and 2 minutes to the subway. The balcony was such a plus. We were catching an evening ferry to Helsinki so Daniel allowed us a late check out. Awesome! We fell in love with Stockholm and would love to return--both to the city and Daniel's place. Thank you so very much!"
1484,299154,103220936,2016-09-21,16352077,Erik,"This apartment is in a great location with lots to do close by. We did not get to meet Daniel, but he was very thorough and prompt with the communication beforehand. His neighbor met us and helped get us situated. I would definitely recommend Daniel's place if you are heading to Stockholm!"
1485,299154,104022313,2016-09-25,34566541,Bharath,"The location of the apartment is fantastic. Its in the centre of town and the old city is a 7-8 min walk and the metro is a min walk. Daniel was very responsive and communicated the details of the arrival, checkin and etc in advance. He was also co-operative for the extension of our check out time as we had a late flight. The only point (as Daniel) has mentioned, the apartment is a bit small and we were three people, so was bit packed for us. "
1486,299154,104700489,2016-09-28,39439120,Carl,Daniel's place is very nice and very close to old town and a metro station. Daniel is also very nice and helped us with our needs.

Also an easy walk across to old town and the palace. Daniel's place was clean and had everything we needed. We loved the sofa/bed and the big tv with all the channels. Daniel was very helpful and kind and booked a taxi for us as we had to leave very early in the morning. Would definitely recommend!"
1493,299154,107011260,2016-10-09,88354264,Shannon,"The apartment was in the best location ever, away from tourists but close to tourist attractions and subway. The host was very warm, and responsive to all my questions and special requests. I had an awesome 48 hours with 2 friends in the cozy (small) studio apartment. We went out all day and had relaxing evenings at home."
1494,299154,107567778,2016-10-11,94594378,Chuhan,"I spent two nights in Daniel's apartment.

1499,299154,109715093,2016-10-23,87425784,Miina,"Daniel was really nice to us. He arranged the check-in according to our needs, gave really good advice and had clean linen and towels for us. The apartment was nice and cozy and the location was great. :) The kitchen might be a bit small for four people, but if you coordinate your meal preparations and everything, that works well too. The guest book and the guide book were good additions.

Overall, we were very happy with our stay and will probably visit again if the need arises."
1500,299154,110126437,2016-10-24,15837009,Victoria,"4 of us stayed at Daniels’ place for 2 nights. Was really easy to find the place, as the location couldn’t be any better. Very central, right next to the metro and in a walking distance to old town. For 4 people the place is rather small, but since we were away most of the day, it worked well. And it has everything that can be needed. Daniel was very helpful and it was easy to communicate with him. Would definitely recommend the place to others! Thanks again, Daniel!"
1501,299154,110919870,2016-10-29,41642845,Loren,"Great location! A few steps away from a train station and just a few minutes walk to Gamla Stan. The apartment is a studio, but has all the amenities you may need. Very clean, and there were fresh sheets and comforters when we arrived. Daniel was very communicative and responded quickly.

Short walks to Gamla Stan, further up to Normalm, or deeper south into Sodermalm were effortless! The apartment is clean, a little cluttered but it's good for both of us. Communication with Daniel was also flawless, and he was so accommodating to our requests. The pizzeria downstairs and the pub nearby were where we spent our many cold cold nights!"

Sodermalm is a wonderful spot with hip shops, restaurants, and cafes. The location of Daniel's apartment allows you to check out all of that out plus a quick walk into Gamla Stan and Central Stockholm. Also very easy to get to the train to/from the airport.

Direkt im Stadtteil Södermalm, nahe am Nachtleben, eine Unmenge an Möglichkeiten Essen zu gehen, tolle Läden von grossen Ketten bis zu kleinen Designerboutiquen. Und trotz der zentralen Lage ist es ausgesprochen ruhig. Wer also gerne Unterwegs ist (Die U-Bahn ist in wenigen Metern zu erreichen) und trotzdem beim, nach Hause kommen seine Ruhe möchte ist hier gut aufgehoben. Der Gastgeber ist toll. Die Kommunikation lief einwandfrei, wir bekamen immer sehr rasch Antwort auf alle Fragen und Anliegen. "

The apartment is perfectly located at the southern tip of the old city and is comfortable, spacious and well-furnished. Perfect for a stay for a couple.

We loved it!

Daniel was an amazingly generous host as when we were stuck for travel to the airport after the terrorist attacks, he drove us all the way - so so kind and generous! We can't thank him enough.

Kunne måske godt have været lidt mere ren, mine børn havde lidt vejrtræknings problemer,  men vi luftede bare ekstra godt ud.
Daniel var meget fleksibel ved ind og udcheckning, hvilket gjorde vores ophold meget roligt og behageligt."

Despite arriving over 2 hours late due to flights etc, Daniel provided very easy and clean instructions on how to get in. There wireless, local guide and of course Daniel at the end of the phone if required. The place is not 5 star but I only needed a desk and bed for the evening. Conveniently located close to many local amenities, comfy bed, super host!"

It has a small balcony suspended over a street that is excellent for drinking coffee and people-watching.  There is a nice pub downstairs on the next corner.  Daniel lives in the apartment much of the time, knows the neighborhood well, helped us settle and explained a few things about the place (and gave us the key), then left but was always a quick communication away.  The beds were comfortable, and it was affordable compared to hotels.  Daniel's communication was excellent.  We would stay here again, without hesitation. "

For example, we said we like to read at night and without us asking, the next day he brought a reading lamp to brighten things up.  We highly recommend you stay in his apartment if it is available."

1551,299154,171832286,2017-07-19,3901277,Karen,"Nicely located. But be sure you confirm with Daniel that he has made the bed and set out soap and toilet paper in the bathroom. Also, his apartment is very small- not appropriate for more than 2 people in my opinion. The double bed is just a platform. Daniel lives there so there are a lot of things overflowing in every space like cleaning supplies in the small bathroom, drawers overflowing with things. We arrived late after a delayed flight to an unmade bed (there were sheets rolled up on the thin mattress- I had to make the bed,) no soap and no toilet paper. We had communicated with him via email several times so I think he is conscientious but we were (Website hidden by Airbnb) toilet paper? Also, although the neighbor he sent us to, Rolf, was very kind, it was stressful thinking we'd arrive after a 10 hr flight to find the Neighbor not at home. Fortunately, the Neighbor was at home but I would not take such a chance again after such a long flight and so much depending on a neighbor being home to give us the key."
1552,299154,172459423,2017-07-21,91319310,Jeffrey,"Great place for family exploring Stockholm in summer.  Close to all sights, great deck and small but very functional apartment.  Loved our stay.  Wifi and TV did not work unfortunately as the wifi was 1 reason we booked but that seemed to be a faulty router and no fault or intent by host."
1553,299154,177236526,2017-08-02,27974,Michael,"The location in Sodermalm is absolutely perfect. If you are going to walk the city, this is a great jumping off point with nothing being too far away. Also, Sodermalm is a great place to go out at night and people watch/have a drink. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay."

There was a small lift which was fantastic as coming from Australia we had big bags to take upstairs.  The balcony was a great escape in the evening to sit and enjoy a drink with the mass of people below.   Your apartment was so close to the action but away enough not to be annoyed by any outrageous noise.  We were a little concerned about the bed, however it was really comfortable.   Also wifi was excellent.   Thanks we loved this cozy apartment.  "

1569,299154,201283215,2017-10-08,4816257,Marije,"Daniel´s place is at the best location in Stockholm, from here you can walk everywhere, you have tons of nice restaurants and (hipster) shops and coffee places around. The place itself is small and very packed but it has all the things you need. The place could have been cleaner, but most important was that Daniel was a very friendly host and he was very helpful when we thought we lost our key. He made us feel very welcome. I´d recommend this place if you want to have a great location for little money (for Swedish standards)."
1570,299154,202396896,2017-10-11,57564277,Matthew,"Great apartment in a really cool location, in a really cool city. Close to lots of trendy shops and only a short walk away from Old Town. Would stay again any time!"

1572,299154,204039991,2017-10-16,18909308,Chris,Daniel was an excellent host. He was very clear and thorough. We arrived much later than our checkout time and he accommodated our schedule with traveling. The place itself is nice and cozy and very convenient as far as location. It's less than a 10 minute walk to old Town and approximately 15 minute walk to the river where a lot of the cruises depart from. Plenty of bars and places to eat around the apartment and close to public transportation. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend Daniel as a host.

Die Wohnung ist gut ausgestattet, wir konnten in der Küche gut kochen um Geld in Restaurants zu sparen.
Die Lage ist perfekt, Södermalm ist sehr schön. Geschäfte, Bars und Restaurants sind direkt eine Straße weiter, man ist schnell zu Fuß am Wasser und in Gamla Stan.
Besonders Empfehlenswert ist abends auf dem Heimweg beim auch nicht weit entferntem Monteliusvägen den Sonnenuntergang anzusehen."
1594,299154,262199267,2018-05-08,135877126,Damien,"emplacement parfait métro à coté, accueil au top très bon séjour dans la capitale suédoise"
1595,299154,263462347,2018-05-12,10695983,Dennis,"Daniel's flat is perfectly located near Slussen on Södermalm. So you have Götgatan only a minute away, as well as the subway station to move around the city. As mentioned, you live within Daniel's own flat, so do not expect  sterile hotel like environment. Nevertheless, the appartment was very clean and comforable. A plus is the little balkony featuring some evening sun. In warm time, expect to have some background murmuring coming up from Götgatan, whilst that underlines the central location. As a host, Daniel was very welcoming. Yet we had only the basics to discuss, he responded fast and the encounter at check-in time was a pleasure."
1596,299154,264903172,2018-05-15,177697382,Angie,"Daniels apartment is in a perfect location.  Lively street nearby, balcony enjoyable.  Apartment is compact and as other reviews stated for 4 people with suitcases a little tight, however it was part of our “experience”!.

Thank you, 
Angie"

It’s a block away from the Slussen station, which made it very easy to explore other parts of the city. My friend and I stayed for two nights and really enjoyed our stay. The apartment is very clean and stocked with amenities (fully stocked kitchen, hot water maker, tea, big screen TV), and the bathroom was also very clean. 

Highly recommend!!"
1599,299154,267083715,2018-05-21,83122840,Michael,Daniel was a great host and very accommodating as we had to add on another person last minute. His place is in a great location just a quick walk to Old Town and around a lot of great little cafe's and restaurants.

1607,299154,282822905,2018-06-28,28449861,Sandra,"L'appartement de Daniel est vraiment petit, il est propre mais très chargé par ses affaires, ce qui ne facilite pas vraiment l'appropriation des lieux, pour faire la cuisine, se détendre etc.. Nous étions deux adultes et un enfant et vraiment c'était top juste.
Propreté partout mais maure de soin dans certains équipements, de cuisine, ou évacuation lavabo ou baignoire.
Linge propre à priori mais pas repassé.
Travaux dès 6h du matin juste en face, impossible de dormir... le prix n'était pas justifié pour moi..
Mais Daniel est très gentil et accès facile à l'appartement, même à 1h du matin! Idéalement situé.
"
1608,299154,285239879,2018-07-03,171417664,Anssi,"Everything went great, tack till Daniel. Only minus was the loud construction site right across the street and they started working really early, but other than that no problemo!"

1610,299154,287519241,2018-07-08,146172913,Monica,"Daniel’s place was the perfect launching point to explore Stockholm from! It’s in a good area that is close to public transportation as well as shops and restaurants. We were able to walk to all of the main sights from Daniel’s place, but you could also take public transportation which is only a few minutes away. The space is cozy but easily fits 2 people. It was homey and had everything we needed for a 3 day weekend exploring Stockholm!"

1615,299154,296603923,2018-07-26,156663774,Chris,"Daniel was an outstanding host. He met with us and showed us everything we needed to know. The apartment was very close to transit and Gamla Stan (be aware that people are out enjoying themselves fairly late into the night, and you will be very close to that action). We were here during a heat wave, and Daniel made sure we had a fan. That was GREATLY appreciated! Definitely a great place for a couple looking to spend time in the city!"
1616,299154,297743505,2018-07-28,83033067,Jieun,Lovely place close to Gamla stan! Grocery stores are in walking distance. Old town was just across the bridge. Communication with Daniel was awesome and places accurate as it is said on air bnb!

1618,299154,299672610,2018-07-31,54993880,Kate,"Daniel’s place is a perfect cosy bolt hole for a city break in Stockholm. It is ideally located, right around the corner from a subway stop but within walking distance to many things in Stockholm- especially the old town. While the space is small, it has everything you need and the little balcony terrace was most appreciated. If I came back to Stockholm I was definitely stay here again, Daniel has thought of everything with lovely little touches everywhere - I would definitely recommend this Airbnb. "
1619,299154,304808276,2018-08-10,43488628,Jennifer,"Perfekt liten lägenheten som ligger otroligt nära allt och väldigt lätt att hitta! 
Daniel är en fantastisk värd som svarar snabbt, är otroligt hjälpsam och svarar gärna på frågor! 
Allt finns i lägenheten, från handdukar, tvål och schampo till en liten ""affär"" i ett skåp där man kan köpa smått som man glömt eller vill ha tex en flaska vin eller tandkräm. 
Fräscht och fint och till och med en chokladbit som välkomstpresent! "
1620,299154,306204824,2018-08-12,87516212,Enda,This is a very well located place to stay when in Stockholm for a short visit as you are very close to all the major sights. There are plenty of nice restaurants and bars nearby. It is a small apartment so I would recommend for a couple or two close friends. Daniel was very quick to respond to any message which was great.

1653,299154,438656568,2019-04-17,48494592,Javier,"Perfect communication. The apartment was quite small but enough for 4 days. We would have appreciated to have more space for clothes and so on since the wardrobes were full of clothes from the owner. Furthermore, If you want to sight seeing everything is close over walking distance!"

1656,299154,446304038,2019-05-01,32367056,Eike,Many thanks for the great accommodation and hospitality.   We had a great time in Stockholm but especially in Södermalm.
1657,299154,447785482,2019-05-04,120673411,Paul,"Daniel's apartment was in a superb location, just 30 seconds from the Slussen metro station. The apartment was compact yet well laid out and never felt cramped. Small touches such as the drinks for sale and Daniel's quick responses made our entire trip stress-free. The photos on Daniel's advert don't do the space the justice it deserves - the views from the balcony were a particular highlight. Thanks for hosting us Daniel!"
1658,299154,449182973,2019-05-06,42986593,Carolyn,"Daniel’s place was an easy location for our stay in Stockholm. We found the place to be a little small for 2 people, but the location was excellent. We were able to talk to all the sites and there were lots of restaurants near the apartment. Daniel was very communicative and flexible with the check-in/check-out time."

1664,299154,460760938,2019-05-30,49667582,Jena,"Daniel’s apartment is in such a good location and was perfect for our short trip to Stockholm.

Daniel is very flexible and welcoming. I would definitely come back. Thanks!"

1675,299154,480748179,2019-07-03,37550358,Ned,"Our stay at Daniel's was fantastic. The apartment is in a great location with lots of restaurants, bars, cafes and shops just seconds away and a quick walk from old town (Gamla Stan). Daniel was a great host who was very easy to communicate with and has lots of good recommendations. Check-in/out was very easy as well.  The apartment has everything you need and a nice little balcony over looking the street. Would definitely stay at Daniel's place again."
1676,299154,481622834,2019-07-05,36712683,James,"We had a great stay in Daniel’s apartment! The location is great in the heart of the city, and the living area itself is nicely decorated and comfortable. Daniel himself was very friendly and useful which added to the experience!"

1678,299154,486140158,2019-07-12,75086519,Gregory,"First of all great value and even better location. You are one block from train station and apartment has nice elevator. Daniel is very responsive and answered all my questions within 5-10 minutes. Place is as listed, small with beds in the main area, it is a studio.  Fully functional kitchen and refrigerator. Daniel, I do believe, also lives there when not rented, which is apparent from his stuff being present. Place is very clean but little cluttered with extra stuff. Believe this is in the description, so no big deal. Just know there is not much place for clothes, etc. Again, great value and location in my opinion.  Thanks Daniel for making my trip great."
1679,299154,489153922,2019-07-16,11326571,Rachel,"My friend and I stayed at Daniel’s for a few days and we were very happy with the location. Daniel is an excellent host. His place is just as described and fit our needs. It may be a bit cramped for more than 2, but it worked well for us, as we spent most of our time exploring the city. We also enjoyed making some meals at home in his kitchen. Daniel was very responsive and helpful to us in planning our trip. We recommend Daniel’s place!"
1680,299154,491360692,2019-07-20,46288435,Arielle,Very well situated flat. Enough space for 3 persons and Daniel is a very communicative host ! I recommend it !
1681,299154,493388713,2019-07-22,273578933,Jan Roger,God plassering sentralt i Stocholm.
1682,299154,494485640,2019-07-24,70438436,Mikko,Centrally located small apartment with a balcony. Very warm in the summer time makes it a little difficult to sleep in the night.
1683,299154,503717664,2019-08-06,69636082,Inyoung,"Daniel is a great host. His timely reply made me set up very practical and reaspnable plans for trip to Stockholms. The location of house is  genuinely teriffic. I was able to visit all theimportant attractions in Stockholm by walk so that it enabled me to save significsnt traffic costs. The room is cozy but it is very comfortable to use 4 persons for a long period. The small balcony is my favorite spot in his house. Who choose this house can easily use All kinds of traffic methods by 2~3 min walk. Highly, recommend Daniel's house to all users of Air-bnb."
1684,299154,505554609,2019-08-09,6044637,Kirsten,Great location. Easy walk to old town and in a cool area with great restaurants and market nearby. Host gave us plums from his garden!

1688,299154,515683748,2019-08-23,110258422,Gerardo,"daniel organize all in perfect syncronicity for our arrive, and indicate all we need to get the apartment adress, he leave delicious fruits and was nice all the time"
1689,299154,518220503,2019-08-26,253302571,Zsofia,"Daniel's place is the perfect location to visit Stockholm, it is in a very cool area, yet the street where the apartment is on is very nice and quite. The main sites are within walking distance or easily approachable with public transport. 
The apartment is a studio, and it could be perfect for a couple or a family with 2 small children, it might be a bit tight for 4 adults but definitely manageable. The inside of the entrance door is a large blackboard so be careful not to smudge it and get a bit of chalk on your clothes. 
Daniel's a great host, very helpful and always quick to respond. We had a great time there."
1690,299154,519313665,2019-08-28,188881520,Éric,"Situation de l'appartement vraiment exceptionnelle.
Métro à 50 m.
Balcon Hyper agréable.
Cuisine bien équipée.
Cet appartement nous a mis tout de suite à l'aise car il n'est pas aseptisé : on se sent bien, comme à la maison. Un léger désordre règne mais cela est très rassurant.
Je recommande vivement !"
1691,299154,520250480,2019-08-30,2975647,Joseph,Very comfortable apartment in an excellent location. Like most flats in Stockholm it is small but was perfectly fine for 2 people + a baby. Check in was very easy using a keysafe and having Netflix on a massive TV was a plus. Thanks for a great stay.
1692,299154,523251925,2019-09-03,8408134,Andrew,"Daniel’s place is in a fantastic location: about as good as you can get. Very convenient. The apartment itself is a small studio and quite cluttered, so probably best as a base for one or two people."
1693,299154,524667510,2019-09-06,117487525,Ana,Very good. I would repeat if coming back to Stockholm
1694,299154,525732172,2019-09-08,166314743,Arancha,"It is the best apartment if you want to stay in Stockholm because its location is more than perfect! Daniel answers you as fast as he can. Near the apartment there are supermarkets, subway and good restaurants and bakeries. The apartment was really clean and confortable. Internet quality is very good. This is the best apartment !"
1695,299154,528530649,2019-09-13,220160196,Pamela,"My husband and I stayed in Daniel’s apartment for 5 nights. It’s easy to get to from airport by train. Daniel is very helpful with transport information and local suggestions. Södermalm is an easy walk across to Gamla Stan and has everything you need (bars, restaurants, groceries) nearby."
1696,299154,532594735,2019-09-20,239376976,Lalasoa,"N'allez pas chercher ailleurs. Chez Daniel est le meilleur. En plus, il est très gentil. Il était venu nous chercher à l'aéroport de Skavsta à 100 km de la ville alors que nous étions arrivé à minuit. Je vous recommande vivement chez Daniel."
1697,299154,536595297,2019-09-27,295864901,Robert,"Great location (if not the best), ideal for 2 people. Walking distance from the centre but also next to metro stations. Daniel knows how to help you enjoy your trip and is always available for any help you might need."
1698,301680,1672282,2012-07-09,2124420,Dianne,"Anita had a full house but organised our stay with her friend Bertil.  His new, modern  free standing house in a garden setting in a peaceful neighbourhood with  woodland area not far from a lake was a lovely place to stay. Amenities were very good, breakfast provided at an extra charge - good coffee. Bertil was helpful with information about exploring Stockholm and the surrounding area and discussing life in Sweden."
1699,301680,19148288,2014-09-07,11671322,Brad,"Anitta and her home were lovely! Anitta welcomed me (after I showed up an hour late due to getting myself lost) warmly, and was pleasant and extremely helpful with all things around the house and Stockholm in general. Her cozy home was very clean and inviting. The bedroom might be the quietest bedroom I've slept in in my time on AirBnB. The neighborhood itself is quiet and easily navigable, a 10 minute walk to the train station with a few bus routes in between. Anitta was very polite and always made sure I had everything I needed. She made sure I had breakfast at the time I requested, and never disappointed. It was a welcoming, cozy, and very relaxing refuge away from busy Stockholm's city center. I would definitely book with Anitta again. Tusen tack för allt!"
1700,301680,19447696,2014-09-12,19015782,Celia,"Anitta was most gracious and kind.  She made my mother and me feel at home and provided very good information about restaurants and sights in the city.  She even sent us on our way with some of her homemade apple cake! Her home is lovely, in à quiet neighborhood but a quick express train to the center.   Staying with Anitta made the big city of Stockholm feel manageable.  Thank you,  Anitta!"
1701,301680,19792259,2014-09-18,20831810,Nico,I had a really really great time at Anittas place there in Långbro. She prepared everything perfectly for me and i could eat breakfast every day. I felt totally comfortable. Many thumbs up for her and her lovely place :) Thanks a lot for the time there....
1702,301680,26353658,2015-02-10,23636273,Hsin C,"Very cozy space, super friendly host! 5 mins away from the train station via 144 bus, and if good weather, 15 mins by walking. Strongly recommended for people who want to explore stockholm or to participate the furniture fair. Thx Anitta!
 "
1703,301680,29990472,2015-04-15,22005166,Matias,"The house is so great. Anitta is such a kind person and helpful. Being at Anitta's home make me feel like staying at my own house. The neighbourhood is so quiet, perfect for people who need to relax after studying, working or just rest after a great walking vacation day! The house is perfectly connected to the city center by bus, train or metro. 
The house is like the photos show, so clean, everything functions perfectly! I warmly recommend it!"
1704,301680,32076300,2015-05-13,31850312,Milly,"I loved staying at Anitta's home! It is clean, cosy and comfortable with everything you need. Anitta is very welcoming and helpful and happy to answer any questions you may have, you will be well looked after. I have moved to Sweden temporarily and Anitta was an amazing help with many other things such as more permanent accommodation after my stay, which made my transition incredibly smooth. It is such a short walk around the corner to the 144 bus stop, and only a 10 minute bus ride to Fruangen T-bana. Långbro is gorgeous, with a lake and a forest nearby, and it's a great idea to stay here if you want to experience a quieter and typically Swedish area, it's very pretty. You will feel like a local and I would highly recommend staying here to anyone, thank you very much Anitta! "
1705,301680,32924624,2015-05-23,32909183,Philip,Anitta made me feel most welcome to her charming house. I would highly recommend her cosy room.
1706,301680,34816427,2015-06-12,34815283,Urs,"Preis/Leistung ist OK. Zimmer und Bett war sauber und wie angepriesen. Frühstück war ""self-service"", da die Gastgeberin in dieser Zeit (Juni) nur tagsüber da war - das war etwas enttäuschend. Lage ist sehr ruhig und genau wie beschrieben."
1707,301680,41015888,2015-08-03,39456503,Victor,"Anitta is a great host, very friendly, polite and intelligent. And definetely, she loves her house!  
The room is very cozy, location is great. Perfect place for those who would like to stay in a quiet peaceful place close to nature, but at the same time be not far from the city center.
There is a nice park and a forest nearby. Lots of birds, rabbits are running all around. Couple of times I even saw little deers! 
Very easy connection to the city center, trains and buses go regularly and accurately. The kitchen is well equipped, even more than I needed. I would strongly recommend this place."
1708,301680,43573619,2015-08-20,41396916,Birgit,"Anitta war sehr hilfsbereit. Sie hatte leider kein geeignetes Zimmer mehr in ihrem Haus für uns 2 Personen frei und hat uns deshalb an einen Nachbarn vermittelt, dessen Haus wunderschön war und in dem wir uns während unseres Aufenthalts in Stockholm sehr wohl gefühlt haben. Der Nachbar hat uns mit wertvollen Stockholm-Tipps versorgt. Gerne kommen wir wieder her und wissen schon, wo wir uns melden werden."
1709,301680,44806364,2015-08-29,40082070,Rod,"Anita is a pleasant and thoughtful host. The accommodation she provides is comfortable and convenient. The fact that she provides food for breakfast makes it very easy to stay at her place, and saves having to shop for groceries. I enjoyed staying at her place for the week that I was in Stockholm."

The neighbourhood was nice and quiet, appriopriate for our stay. The house was very nice and cosy with lots of happy life memories.
Thank you Anitta for welcoming us!"
1712,301680,48235100,2015-09-24,40872265,Neil,Great apartment about 29 min south of Stockholm city center.  I stayed with Anitta's family friends down the street since her b&B was full.  The family I stayed with was incredibly gracious and helped me until I found a permanent apartment in the city
1713,301680,48514963,2015-09-27,10281815,Carolina,"ero a Stoccolma per lavoro e ho pensato alla zona di Alsjoi per essere vicina alla fiera.In realtà non ho alloggiato da Anitta perchè mi ha  detto che causa overbooking (??) mi avrebbero ospitato dei vicini nello stesso isolato... ho chiesto più volte le foto ma non mi sono state fornite.
la coppia che mi ha ospitato è stata molto gentile e ospitale anche se la stanza non corrispondeva affatto a quella pattuita,
era in un ground floor con divano letto, sapendolo avrei fatto sicuramente una scelta diversa. inoltre una settimana prima ho avvisato che invece di 3 notte avrei soggiornato per due notti, ed ho trovato grande rigidità dell'host a decurtarmi la notte che non avevo usufruito."

Die Anbindung nach Stockholm C und Arlanda C war super und echt easy zu nehmen. Insgsamt ein sehr guter Aufenthalt. Es gab morgens immer ein wenig Brot, Tee/Kaffee, Butter und Käse oder Schinken. Ansonsten konnte die Küche auch so mitbenutzt werden, genauso wie das Bad, die Handtücher und das W-LAN.

1731,301680,291559670,2018-07-16,192500467,Mitchell,"I stayed with Anitta's neighbor, Tina. I had my own room and bathroom with full amenities. Tina was a friendly and helpful host, and prepared a generous breakfast for me each morning. The house was within walking distance of Stockholmsmässan, where I was attending a conference during my stay. Everything was clean and tidy, and the house was situated within a quiet, cozy neighborhood. Thanks for a lovely trip!"
1732,302496,1504713,2012-06-18,2150483,Mehran,"We came to Stockholm with four adults and our small son and the accommodation Seta and Göran offered us could not have been better. They gave us a warm welcome in their wonderful spacious and bright apartment and prepared everything so nicely for our one week stay in Stockholm. The two were very helpful and willing to answer all our questions. I especially loved their collections of modern artworks and literature as well as the antiquated elevator of the house, too. 
You can find plenty restaurants, at least three supermarkets, a nice bakery, a kiosk or a bank branch in the closest neighborhood, so that the everyday requirements could easily be satisfied. Several bus lines with stops right in front of the house connect you directly to the city center.
We thank Seta and Göran very much for everything and not least because of them we will keep fond memories of Stockholm."
1733,302496,1622750,2012-07-03,1170430,Jennifer,"This flat/penthouse is absolutely amazing! I was so lucky to have found it and I enjoyed every minute of it during my 8 day stay there. Simply stated: you must stay here if you are in Stockholm. It is located in Norrmalm, one of the most sought-after areas of Stockholm, and is conveniently located to every attraction. Gamla Stan is only a quick and beautiful 25 minute walk away, the Stureplan district is maybe a 20 minute walk away. In the immediate neighborhood there is a small grocery store right across the street, an amazing Thai food stand/gourmet truck one block away, and for any Americans who may have withdrawls from lack of ranch dressing and an overabundance of ice (aka Me!) there is a Hard Rock Cafe 2-3 blocks away. Not to mention the numerous bakeries and coffeehouses within one block. I absolutely adored this flat: amazing views of a beautiful part of Stockholm, all the unique and beautiful art in the flat (the large painting in the dining room was the topic one night at dinner), the lovely foyer entrance, the (Website hidden by Airbnb) was absolutely perfect. And the flat is in a building that is over 100 years old, so you have the old architecture and the really nifty old elevator. And Seta is a perfect host-she is very friendly, nice, easy to communicate with, and when I had any questions she answered via text or offered to call right away. And this was Midsommar weekend, so you know she had other plans going on, but she was still very fast in replying. When I come back to Sweden again in the future, I will absolutely be staying here! I think anyone who has a chance to stay in this flat and passes it up is crazy-you simply must stay here. "
1734,302496,1903707,2012-08-06,2823606,Alessandro,Seta is a wonderful and enthusiastic person. Her apartment is a wonderful top apartment. I'm sad that I had to leave! I hope to be back!
1735,302496,2036682,2012-08-20,2121805,Claire,"I gave 3 stars  only because of location and the fact that the owner was responsive about  some of the many issues we had. 
Overall, we think they are very inexperienced about (Website hidden by Airbnb) were disappointed, we have rented many times in Europe and really this time we encountered some problems.
No privacy drapes on living room and 1 bedroom window (we had to hang some dark cheap fabric drapes bought by the previous renter). Kitchen was not clean (oven in real bad shape) old refrigerator  toaster  ultra small old microwave all in bad conditions, furniture including sofas and rugs are very warn  sitting in front of a window without curtains, facing  neighbors, iron not functioning.
The owner replaced old pots that we had scratched clean but this was not enough to make us feel comfortable.
Some art is  extreme and too explicit, dark religious, and of sexual unnecessary display.We are liberal adults who love art but that was really too much."
1736,302496,2414215,2012-09-25,3205032,Carl,"Unlike the previous comment, I can assure that the apartment is perfect for a stay in Stockholm.

Hosts Seta and Gören were very welcoming and helpful, took care of adding extra double bed for extra person, buying breakfast for the next day as well.

Apartment is greatly located/decorated, very nice, clean, big and fully equiped.

Have found my new place in town for sure.

And the art is art :)"

1738,302496,2760020,2012-10-30,2797095,Justin,"Seta and Göran were the most fantastic hosts. Their apartment is very charming and conveniently placed with walking distance to the city centre. They were very accommodating to our wishes. We enjoyed lovely dinners with them and they were open to share the experience with us and our guests.

If you want friendly hosts who see you as more than a paying guest, but rather as someone with whom to share joy, this is the place to stay. At the same time, they assured us that if we had wanted the place entirely to ourselves, they would have arranged that too."
1739,302496,4633315,2013-05-17,5040661,Sylvia,"We loved our stay at Seta's apartment. The apartment is very very central. You can find anything you need in short distance such as a supermarket, bottle shop, ATM, nice restaurants, etc. The apartment is very nice and clean, quite huge and has everything you need. There are two very comfortable beds, free wireless and television with lost of channels. The kitchen is fully equipped. If we would come back to Stockholm we would definitely stay again in this apartment. Seta was a very welcoming and nice host. She gave us so many great advises for sightseeing and restaurants. We can recommend this apartment very very much. "
1740,302496,5179823,2013-06-17,5945652,Fedor,We've stayed at the apartment for a week. We loved it very much. It's a big full of light apartment furnished with great taste. It's good located in the center and the same time  quiet. Owners were very nice and helpful.   
1741,302496,5521448,2013-07-04,4889248,Анастасия,"We stayed at Seta's apartment in a big family company with four kids (10, 6, 6 and 3 years old). We enjoyed our stay at the property for the following reasons: the place is spacious, conveniently arranged, decorated in style, there is enough light in the rooms, the staircase and elevator are very pleasant, the location was convenient for us (grocery store in 1 min walk, metro station in 5-6 minutes, several parks with good playgrounds in about 10-15 min), it is also possible to walk to the city center, Seta was responsive, accommodative and understanding host. Thank you!
"
1742,302496,6639908,2013-08-19,828904,Peter,"This is a great apartment - it's absolutely huge and it's very well appointed.  Seta is a very accommodating host who went out of her way to let us check in and check out at very convenient times for our group, and to fix any issues we had with the apartment very quickly.  The location is great and everything you could possibly need is within a few minutes' walk.  I will definitely stay here again next time I'm in Stockholm."
1743,302496,7852374,2013-10-06,7607522,Scott,"We LOVED this apartment! We were four adults (Dad and three adult kids) and the place was huge, with wonderful enormous daylight windows and room after room after room! No privacy issues and comfortable couches for morning coffee and evening bottles of wine. Heated floor in the bathroom and a great functional kitchen.The location is equally great. Two blocks or less to everything: subway, restaurants, grocery, and a variety of interesting stores. 20 minutes to central station, the waterfront, museums, or nearly any other location in the city. Seta was gracious (she dropped by mid-week to meet us) as was her son, Christopher, who met me and gave me the tour the first day. We could not have had a better first visit to Stockholm and we hope Seta's place is available for our next trip! "
1744,302496,9275324,2013-12-17,1148612,Bruno,The house is perfectly located and is absolutely gorgeous and very spacious. The 2 main bedrooms are beautiful and extremely comfortable. The 2 extended bedrooms are good but not as good ad the main 2 ones. The hosts are very friendly.

The apartment is very spacious, in a great part of town and very close to public transport. Serta was very welcoming, helpful and kind. If I were in Stockholm I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
1746,302496,17996836,2014-08-20,12043562,Martin,"Great location; fantastic, enormous, bright and interesting apartment.  We loved the artwork and furnishings.  We were met by Christopher (Seta's son), who was very welcoming.  Lots of shops, bars and amenities close to the apartment including a tube station a couple of minutes away.  Our family visit to Stockholm was definitely enhanced by staying here.  Would recommend to anyone visiting Stockholm. "

She and Goran were just back from vacation but managed in order to provide us with a fresh cleaned - fully furnished house.
The flat is even wider than it appears in the pictures and is really confortable
 Moreover it is very well located (close to tube and bus, groceries and nice restaurant ) 10 minutes to downtown
I would strongly reccomend it ."

The apartment was more than photos can ever display ;) it was spacious, had The ambience! The whole place is fully equipped, from the kids department till kitchen. Seta as host was very helpful and her warm welcome gave a good start to our stay. We were three adults and two kids (10m/5y) and all that comes along. "
1749,302496,24815787,2015-01-03,21655610,Elle,"Our two-week stay in this gorgeous apartment could not have been lovelier. Roomy, comfortable, well-maintained, well-equipped, classic Stockholm apartment was a joy to spend time in, for not just the three of us, but for our family and friends who we entertained during our stay. Ideally located with restaurants, gym, stores and transportation nearby. Our hosts were not fussy at all, very agreeable and easy-going and made us feel warmly welcomed...all arrangements were made without complications...we would not hesitate to rent again if the opportunity arose and could not give a higher recommendation."

The proximity to the bus, metro, and Coop in an active yet quiet area allowed us to meet and talk with locals as we traveled with ease to other areas of the city.  

Seta's son, Christopher, met us at the apartment and kindly walked us through the apartment giving us information and advice.  He made us feel very welcome.   Seta herself was often in touch through email.    

We know you will enjoy the experience as much as we have.   "
1752,302496,38101387,2015-07-13,13494445,Markus,The apartment is perfect for discover Stockholm. There are large rooms and all tastefully decorated. We were two couples and there were enough room for each. We felt immediately at home. Seta was taking care of us and offered here support. Every thing was perfect. The week was over to soon. We will recommend the apartment.
1753,302496,41779218,2015-08-09,28701552,James,Staying in Seta's home was one of the highlights of my trip to Stockholm.   Operating as my home for time in Stockholm I felt like a resident more than a tourist.  I was able to maintain a fairly rigorous schedule of sightseeing and day trips; access to transportation was right outside the door.   A few nights we stayed in a prepare meals in the wonderful kitchen and ate in the dining room with candles.  A few close friends staying near by visited for a wine and cheese and they all marveled at the palatial setting.  Honestly this was one of my top hosted experiences.   i wouldn't change a thing.
1754,302496,44884090,2015-08-30,4827738,Rick,"We loved staying in Seta’s gracious, charming, very large flat. Every day was busy. It was great to know that we had a tremendously comfortable apartment to come back to after our wandering walks around the centre of Stockholm and expeditions farther afield. Seta was very welcoming and helpful. Her son Christopher helped us out, too. 

The location of Seta’s apartment was ideal. There are buses that stop outside the front door. The subway is a few blocks away. We could do our grocery shopping across the street. Pretty much any other kind of store we needed was within a block or two. Yet, the neighbourhood is quiet. 

We really look forward to coming and staying with Seta again.
"
1755,302496,56126788,2015-12-09,47274257,Marcus,"Seta and Goran's flat is fantastic. It is much larger than the pictures show, is extremely well equipped and in a lovely neighbourhood (for those that don't know Stockholm it is also only a 15 minute walk to the waterfront but located in a very traditional and smart neighbourhood). Seta and Goran are both delightful and very helpful and generous too. We could not have stayed in a  better place and could not recommend their flat more highly. "
1756,302496,70215424,2016-04-17,53066077,Andrea,"From the first interaction, Seta was an excellent and welcoming hostess.  The apartment is in an amazing location in Stockholm, walking distance to great restaurants, cafes, stores and all forms of public transportation.  Seta met us upon our arrival and made sure that we had everything we needed.  She checked in with us during our stay to confirm that all was going well.  The apartment was bright, spacious, and beautiful.  It was the perfect home base for our week in Stockholm. We especially appreciated the large kitchen and bathrooms.  The apartment was the perfect size for our party of five. "
1757,302496,74483290,2016-05-15,38629848,Joerg," We spent two weeks in Stockholm in Setas Apartment, working for the Eurovision Song Contest. After a hard working day Setas Apartment is the best place to relax, a lot of space for everyones privacy. Ecspecially I liked that many little Buddhas everywhere. Everything was clean and the flowers in the living area made us feel good. The beds are comfortable, in the kitchen you can find everything you need. It was perfect for us, we will come back, maybe if Sweden wins Eurovision again. "
1758,302496,77962334,2016-06-04,45851360,Dan,"We booked Seta's apartment for the first week of June but due to some understandable and unfortunate circumstances, Seta had to cancel our reservation. She took upon herself to arrange for a rental at her neighbor's apartment in the same building and on the same floor. We were the first guests in the alternate apartment and loved every minute of it. It is a great building in a fantastic neighborhood in an awesome city. Very easy access to transit and great restaurants in the area. If we return to Stockholm we would book either Seta's apartment or the any apartment in the building."

Seta left us some recommendations for restaurants in the area and we tried a few-- they were great. The apartment is also located near public transportation and is close enough to the downtown area that you could walk. Seta was also very accommodating when we needed an extra bed for an extra guest. I would definitely recommend staying at Seta's place. 
1761,302496,93471138,2016-08-12,4212560,Diana,"We (4 adults) had a wonderful experience.  There was ample room and more for us. It was great to have one large bathroom and a separate shower and 3 toilets! We made use of the kitchen for breakfast and some evening meals.  The neighbourhood was very quiet and there were several supermarkets and coffee shops nearby. We used the bus and underground (T-Bana) to get around plus it was easy walking distance to the city centre. Coming back to the apartment at the end of a busy day was a joy. The size of the place was amazing- we could all find a spot to un-wind and relax. All in all, Seta's apartment was a great find on AirBNB. Seta and her place exceeded all expectations. Thank you Seta. "

The apartment is so large, you almost get lost in it.  Although on a rather large street, centrally located, the apartment is quiet and calm in the night.  Really, we could not be more satisfied.  Thanks Seta and Göran for everything!"
1763,302496,99176681,2016-09-03,29221501,Rob, Fabulous flat with wonderfully kind hosts in a great location in central Stockholm. We loved our stay and recommend without reservation! Enjoy.

Veel restaurants om de hoek waar je kunt ontbijten, lunchen en dinneren. Het appartement is goed uitgerust en ondanks aan een vrij drukke straat goed stil.
We vonden het jammer dat we weer naar huis moesten."

Easy walks to the metro and only 15 minutes to central Stockholm by foot. All amenities in apartment worked very well. We understand that the owners have plans to upgrade the kitchen area very soon and this will make the facilities even better. Seta and her husband were extremely helpful and caring.

The apartment is spacious and bright. The area is vibrant, very accessible, conveniently located within the city and close to two of Stockholm's most popular parks. Seta was very accommodating to our special requests and communication was very easy. I would recommend staying at their place!"

Værtsfolkene er meget fleksible, imødekommende og engagerede. De gav os en hjertelig velkomst og havde sat vin, frugt og kage til os. 
Beskrivelse og fotos af lejligheden bør opdateres, så det er tydeligt, at der er et stort soveværelse og et lille med en mindre dobbeltseng."
1770,302496,199529935,2017-10-02,18019892,Kyurim,"What an amazing home!  
Seta's home is very large, bright, quiet, central.  It is perched on the 3rd floor (Accessible via elevator) and the house is sun lit and very bright with open layout.  There are artworks throughout the home which brings out the character to the home.  Getting around is super easy as the bus station is immediately in front of the house and there are both Green & Red line T-bana(subway) stations near by.   There are lot of great dining options and stores near by as well.

I had an opportunity to meet both Seta and her son in person, and they seem super kind and welcoming in many ways.  All-in-all, my family and I had a wonderful stay at Seta's place.  

Seta, thank you for opening your home to us.  We love Stockholm and staying at your home has been a memorable Stockholm experience."

Seat greeted us personally upon arrival to show us around the apartment which is breathtakingly beautiful. The ceilings are soaring and the natural light is abundant. We traveled with our toddler and our hosts provided us with a travel crib, high chair and an extensive amount of toys to keep our young one entertained, it was above and beyond!

The apartment itself is lovely and quite large with numerous interesting art pieces, an extensive collection of books, 2 bathrooms, comfortable furniture, a beautifully updated modern kitchen and laundry area - which was very convenient to have while traveling with a 2 year old.

We were extremely happy with our stay and will certainly return again when we visit our family next time around. Seta is super responsive to inquiries and very kind to engage with. "

It is one of the best apartments one can stay at in Stockholm."
1778,302496,308892544,2018-08-17,89382459,Barbara,"The location of the apartment was very convenient. It is quite large and spacious however it is not a three bedroom apartment. There is one functioning bedroom that has a closet. The other small room does not have a closet or dresser and there is no place to put your clothes. The third Bedroom is the library which does not have a bed or closet space for clothing. 
My husband and I and a family friend were in Sweden for our daughters wedding. We were all very respectful and cautious with the apartment. So we were stunned to come home to a scathing email accusing us of miscellaneous damages! The owner claimed that we had damaged the window sills by opening the windows but they were certainly damaged and old when we arrived.  There was a horrific heatwave so of course we needed to open windows
She suggested that someone had vomited on her carpet which left us completely speechless! She accused us of breaking a piece of coral in her window sill which we never touched. There are all kinds of knickknacks all over the place and some are in very bad condition.
I would suggest that you do not rent this apartment if you have any intention of using the kitchen. The owner has just installed a marble countertop that is extremely susceptible to damage. We were very cautious using the kitchen but we’re still accused of damaging the countertop.
Also do not invite some of your adult relatives over for dinner as you’ll be accused of being a partier! We are  mid 60s and it’s been quite a long time since we’ve been considered party people. 
So to return from such a special trip And to have this very upsetting email demanding a significant amount of money to repair things that we did not damage and threatening to report to Airbnb that we are horrible people and do not belong in the community.  Over the years we have stayed in many many rental properties and have always had glowing reviews about us as guests.

The apartment was really spacious with three bedrooms, a living- and a dinning room perfect for the occasion! A new kitchen with all equipment you could wish for to make a nice dinner for family and friends. We really enjoyed our stay, close to everything, buses, metro, shops, restaurants and ten minutes walk to the city. Seta and Göran were very nice and easy to get in touch with, check in and check out went smooth. In other words, a top-level apartment with a top location."

1784,302496,449153009,2019-05-06,250241858,Franziska,"Seta was a great host. Easy to communicate with and quick to respond. The apartment is large, wonderfully furnished with a magnificent kitchen. All in all we spent a delightfully weekend in their apartment."
1785,302496,454448623,2019-05-18,63268793,Kristin,"Amazing location, gorgeous, huge apartment, beautiful kitchen, and a super helpful host. This place is a gem!"
1786,302496,458520719,2019-05-26,38073616,Espen,Flott leilighet sentralt i Stockholm. Godt vertskap og høy standard.
1787,302496,464211614,2019-06-05,17688893,Tom,"The apartment is absolutely huge.  The entry, living dining and library rooms are warm and inviting and decorated with outstanding art.  The location could not be more convenient.

We found the master bed room a great place to sleep.  The second bedroom is in the back of the apartment off the kitchen, I am sure it was serving quarters but the bed was very comfortable.  We did not try or use the foldout bed which is located in the dining room.

Seta was very responsive.  She arranged the next door neighbor to let us in.  She responded to every request, usually within 30 minutes.

Our only negative is the distance from the bathroom to the master bedroom.  One had to walk the entire length of the apartment. If there were more than just one family staying in the apartment this might be problematic.

Overall we loved it."
1788,302496,469339312,2019-06-14,9563800,Kristine,"This is a very comfortable and lovely home. The kitchen is complete and well designed. The high ceilings, spacious rooms, many windows and artistic decor made it feel special. It’s convenient to central Stockholm with buses and metro so close. Tip: if you’re a light sleeper bring ear plugs to shut out traffic noises. I did and was perfectly comfortable and slept well."
1789,302496,475358226,2019-06-24,74316420,Greg,Beautiful place and great location. Highly recommend staying here while exploring Stockholm

1794,302496,521860698,2019-09-01,1284078,Rebecca,"Seta's place worked extremely well for us. The location can't be beat. Very close to the subway, grocery stores, restaurants, and anything else a person might need. The apartment is enormous and is decorated in a stylish, artistic manner. The kitchen is very well equipped and my son made great use of the laundry room!  Seta and Goran are a pleasure in person and I hope to stay at their place again in the future!"
1795,302496,527605426,2019-09-11,42629088,Jason,Was a very nice apartment with very large spaces. Lots of beautiful art and everything needed for our stay. The location was perfect and easy to get everywhere with lots within walking distance.
1796,302496,531810901,2019-09-18,263418770,Ye,It’s a very very nice and big apartment in central Stockholm. The house is build in 1915 and it keeps the way it was which is super cool. We have a very nice time living here and the landlord Göran is a very nice person. I m highly recommend the apartment .
1797,313195,1875580,2012-08-03,163048,Luca,David was very helpful and communication was excellent. The apartement is spacious and very conveniently located. Absolutely a recommended place to stay in Stockholm!
1798,313195,1931464,2012-08-09,2193999,David,The spirit of stockholm surrounds this apartment.  One Spacious flat with a smart selection of vintage furniture that give a warm ambience all arround the loft. Having breakfast in the fancy kitchen was another scandinavian  expererience . The quiet ambiance and the comfortable bed also added one level up to our time on the capital of Sweden . For sure We will try to come back to David's apartament
1799,313195,2133676,2012-08-29,2789534,Katharina,"All perfect! Clean and quiet appartement. Supermarket, bus stations and airport shuttle just around the corner.
David was absolutely reliable and well organized. We really enjoyed our stay. Thank you!"

1801,313195,2246973,2012-09-10,1429297,Mandee And Joel,"David's flat was a comfortable & affordable place to stay in Stockholm.  It's also very close to a subway station and located on the ground floor (in case you have a lot of bags!)  

The flat is much larger then it looks in the photos and David was great about communication prior to our arrival.  Lovely stay!"
1802,313195,2605837,2012-10-14,1272938,Jan,"We had a very comfortable stay at David's place! The rooms and beds were comfortable and warm. The shower worked great as well, and the minimalistic furnishings were all we needed - as we were out and about most of the time anyway! The kitchen is nicely set-up in case you need to cook or store your food, etc, we only needed to boil some water for tea so it was perfect for us! Though there is a supermarket just around the corner and metro station just about 5-10 minutes walk. The neighbours had drilling in their apartment for 2 of the 4 days we were there - so it was an early morning call for us on those days! But that is not within anyone's control, and we still had a thoroughly happy stay. :) Thanks David!"
1803,313195,2666821,2012-10-20,1121440,Helena,"Me and a friend had a great stay at Davids apartment! David was easy to communicate with, helpful and friendly. The key exchange went smooth and the place was nice, light and clean with comfy beds. Would definitely stay here again!"
1804,313195,2810081,2012-11-05,3513678,Lina,"We spent an amazing time in David place last week end in Stockolm. We were 4 friends and it was perfect for us.
I particulary loved the design, it's very well decorated and so warm.
The apparment is near Odenplan subway station, so it's was so easy to go to the center of the city (in few minutes!) wich is very helpfull when you stay  few days!
Thanks David for your hospitality!

1805,313195,2986031,2012-11-28,981992,Jan,"It is a really cosy flat, tastfully furnished, fully equiped and it works well staying there with 4 people. You really feel like home, also because David is a great host. We had a great time and would always come back (although next time in summer, when the weather is better ;) Thanks David"
1806,313195,3243644,2013-01-03,3722946,Sophie,"Great location in a family area, not far from metro, supermarket around the corner, 15min from town center with a good walk and tasty apartment!"
1807,313195,3426226,2013-01-28,3870805,Santiago,"David's apartment was everything I was excepting. I felt he provided a great services throughout. 

The apartment is very cosy and gave me a very good vibe from the second we arrived. It was really clean, too. It's location is also brilliant with a handful of nice little restaurant and bars close by and only 10 minutes away from the nearest tube. 

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to other travellers. "
1808,313195,3539779,2013-02-14,322309,Jessie,"David's apartment was so beautiful, clean and functional. It felt very luxurious for me and my travel partner to have our own ""rooms"" to sleep in- something which I think is hard to find in Stockholm.
There was plenty of space to do things in, without having to shuffle around someone else's stuff and we really appreciated having a washing machine.
There was a problem with the internet when we were there but David was very attentive and tried his hardest to sort it out.
One thing, which is no fault of David's, was that a gym had newly opened underneath the apartment and was very noise all throughout the day including early morning and into the night.
The area is convenient to reach other places but doesn't have so much happening around it.
I highly recommend David's place. It was cosy and felt like home."
1809,313195,3572252,2013-02-18,4808689,Josh,"Really enjoyed our stay in David's apartment. There were four of us (two couples) and the size of the place was perfect for our group.
Very homely place, will definitely try to stay again when we're back in Stockholm."
1810,313195,3849607,2013-03-20,5352316,Paco,"All perfect clean and quiet apartment. Supermarket, tub and old town just around the corner. David was absolutely reliable and well organized. We really enjojed our stay. Thanks David!"
1811,313195,3931133,2013-03-28,5088208,Karin,"We (a family with three kids at the age of 3 to 9) stayed in David's appartment for four nights and we really liked that place a lot. The contact to David was very nice, he gave us good advices for our stay. In the appartment we felt very comfortable. You can feel that two architects live here. Everything is very functional, but warm and welcoming. There was only twice a little noise from the neighbours but this never lasted more than half an hour. Maybe they had a problem to fix. We easily found our way from the airportbus to the appartment, which was the best way (without underground and changing) to travel with the kids. Also bus no 2 is very helpful. We very seldom used the underground. The supermarket is around the corner which is open also during the weekend until 22o'clock and many little restaurants and bars. We had a very pleasant time and we can only recommend David's place. Hope we can come back soon to see more of this beautiful city. 4 days are definitely not enough. Thanks David! "
1812,313195,4473730,2013-05-07,3730086,Nicole,"I recently stayed at David's apartment with a friend. We were met by David on arrival, (which was late evening so thank you David :-)) and had a very enjoyable stay. David's apartment is very comfortable, and we enjoyed the space of two beds and rooms, along with a very nice kitchen. The apatment is a short walk to the metro station, with easy links into T Centralan and the main city. Would stay again! Nicole

The apartment met all of our expectations AND more. It was clean, fully equipped and excellently located. We also loved the vibe and design of the place - certainly felt like a home away from home. 

David, the host, was extremely flexible with our travel arrangements and was a pleasure to deal with. 

I recommend this place to anyone planning on travelling to Stockholm. 

THANKS!  "
1815,313195,4829488,2013-05-28,5162247,Doug,A wonderful place in a good location. Communication with David was good throughout the process from booking to check-out. The apartment was perfect for our needs. We were able to live comfortably and had easy access to public transportation.
1816,313195,4917511,2013-06-02,5363309,Ellen,"We were 2 couples and stayed 3 nights in David’s apartment. He was there when we arrived (very late at night!) gave as the key and all the instruction we needed. The apartment was clean with fresh sheet on the bed + towels for the bathroom. There is a Supermarket just around the corners and a Metro Station 8 minutes walking. The only thing which was a little bit annoying was the gym next to the apartment, which was noisy in the morning. But nevertheless we enjoyed our stay in David´s apartment a lot – Thanks David, you were a great host and we would definitely come again!!"

If you want to walk to the centre it takes you about 25min to get there, or get a metro and be there in 4 stops:-)
"
1819,313195,22048051,2014-10-28,4151003,Zachary,"David var ett bra värd och han har en vacker lägenhet! Det var jag och en vän som bodde här och vi älskade den. Vi hade vår egna sovrum, ett härligt kök och vardagsrum, och vi var nära restauranger, kaféer, och barer. Det är enkelt att gå till Odenplan eller bara 25 minuter till Centrum. Det var snällt av David för att låta oss använder sin kylskåpet och mat, men vi var ute i staden så mycket. Det var trevligt att komma tillbaka till ett bekväm, folklig ställe att sova eller att ta en små frukost och kaffe. David var lätt att nå med frågor och visade mig runt omkring lite också. Tack!!

David was a wonderful host and has a beautiful apartment! My friend and I lived here for four nights and we loved it. We had our own beds, a wonderful kitchen and living room, and we werve very close to good restaurants, cafes, and bars. It was easy to walk to Odenplan or only about 25 minutes to downtown. It was nice of David to offer his fridge and food, but we were out so much around town anyway. It was great to come back to a comfortable, homey place to sleep and maybe have breakfast and coffee. David was easy to reach with questions and even with his busy schedule showed me around a bit, too! Thanks, David!"
1820,313195,26061217,2015-02-02,25829628,Sander,We had a nice stay in Davids simple but cosy apt. Some walking requied to the metro's but no longer thanks 15 min.

The kitchen is simple but you find everything you need. The beds are both very comfortable and David even provides towels. The flat is in a calm and nice neighbourhood where you find also a lot of Cafés, Restaurants, shops and there are good connections to public transprt. "

1823,313195,36021822,2015-06-24,33013914,Shi,David welcomed us at his house and he was very friendly. We arrived on midsummer's day and our flight was slightly delayed. We were sorry to have disturbed his day but David was very kind and waited for us. The house had very comfortable beds and a well stocked kitchen. The house is a short 3 mins to the bus stop which brings us to town. The supermarket was also just round the corner. Convenient and quiet neighbourhood. We had a pleasant stay! 
1824,313195,36332330,2015-06-27,9505272,Anis,"David was a great host, always looking to help and provide us with all that we needed.

It's really easy to access the center of the city from the flat either via bus, metro or even walking.

Overall, we had a great experience in Stockholm and David helped it to happen.

So thanks to him and good luck to him and his future guests.

1826,313195,37794559,2015-07-10,18197465,Emma,I really liked Davids place! The beds were comfortable and best of all was the inspiring interior. It didnt take long to get to the center and we found good restaurants nearby (tutto bello was worth walking to!). We were two couples staying at David's place for 3 nights. Would stay again :).
1827,313195,39105521,2015-07-20,37701361,Marius,Good place at a great location. Apartment was nice and clean with ample space for the three of us traveling together. There are many nice restaurants and cafes close to the apartment and the city is in walking distance. David was very friendly and accommodating. We booked the apartment only a few days before we arrived and David answered our request immediately.

 He met us at the apartment, showed us around and made some excellent recommendations for where to go and enjoy Stockholm!  

The beds were comfortable, the shower was also good. 
It was a short walk to a supermarket and a bit further to the nearest Tunnelbana but very convenient in a nice neighbourhood.

We would definitely return!"

1831,313195,73834531,2016-05-10,9151879,Beatriz,"David was a great host! He was very responsive to all of our concerns and was very reliable. 

The place itself is very beautiful--there are two comfortable real beds and the small space in the home is very well utilized. There's great decor and it has so much character. It is very beautiful. The beds are comfortable and the washer has a dryer. The place is complete with all the basics that you need. The only tricky part is the stove, which wouldn't really stay on and we never figured out how to make it stay on. There's also amazing light that filters through the place, and a supermarket 2 minutes away. 

The location is a bit quieter and a 20 minute+ walk to some sights in Stockholm, but the neighborhood is safe and pretty. If you are with a large group, I recommend splitting an uber/taxi from wherever you are. Our party didn't mind the farther location because it was a wonderful place. "

Naapurusto on rauhallinen. Davidin kanssa asioiden hoitaminen on helppoa, ja hän myös tarjosi nopeasti apua erinäisten lisätarpeidemme kanssa. Asunto on tyylikäs ja rento, ja siinä oli mukava asua neljän yön ajan. "
1836,313195,89578451,2016-07-29,31759288,Ignacio,"La casa es tal como se muestra en las fotos. Un pequeño detalle es que tiene sólo una ventana y no tiene ventiladores, y llega a hacer mucho calor.
A la hora de llegada David no estuvo presente y no atendió nuestras llamadas, por lo que pudimos entrar a la casa por pura casualidad (alguien amable llegó al edificio y nos abrió). Definitivamente este sistema debe cambiarse.
Más allá de eso, la casa es muy linda y la recomiendo"

The apartment is beautiful and accurate as it shows on the listing. Both beds were both very comfortable and we had a good rest at the place. Very cozy and chilled, just feels like home honestly! For girls, do bring a hairdryer with u if u need it as they don't it in the accommodation.

In term of location - the tube can be a bit of walking distance however the bus stop nearby gets u to all the location that u would needed as tourist. Big supermarket just round the corner for quick breakfast. We love the place and would love to come bk anytime! Thanks David! :) "

It is very clean and well kept and Per-Marten had been a great host, giving us great recommendations and being available for questions we had during the stay. We would definitely recommend this place for friends and family and hope to some day come back!
(BTW - the location is great, just off the subway, with many great restaurants nearby. It's also pretty close to everything and with a few minutes walk would get you to most places)."

It's literally footsteps away from the Subway, buses and restaurants in a top Stockholm neighborhood. Highly recommended."
1852,313763,55933131,2015-12-07,48320799,Christopher,"We had a great time staying at Martin's flat - everything was as described on the listing.The beds were comfy, and the kitchen was well stocked and the TV had plenty of channels. There is also a great balcony (we were there in winter, but it has a nice view of a local church). 

The area is also really nice, with plenty of bars, coffee shops and the metro is a 2 minute walk away, and only about 5 minutes to central Stockholm. There is also a convenience store just around the corner.

Martin was friendly, and greeted us at the flat, and had provided some great tips for local restaurants/bars etc. He always got back to e-mails/messages very quickly, and was very flexible when it came to us checking out. :)

1853,313763,56811593,2015-12-18,50750003,Jian,"The host has been very kind and helpful, he provided us quick informative city tour guide.
Despite that, the apartment is nice and comfortable. The real size of the room looks actually larger than the picture. Facilities are properly equipped. Location is in the very centre of Stockholm, easy to access subway in 1 min. Recommend to everyone."
1854,313763,60359712,2016-01-22,54352679,Christopher,"I visited Stockholm for work and Martin's apartment was perfect. Warm, comfy and clean. If I lived in Stockholm, I would get a similar apartment.  Great location in a very cool part of the city. Martin met me at the apartment and provided a ton of extremely helpful feedback. This was above and beyond what I expected but very helpful for someone visiting the city for the first time. I would highly recommend staying here. His list of restaurants, tips on the city and overall friendly demeanor made the stay very comfortable. Had some of the best Lebanese food I have ever had.  Just wish I had more time in the city. Thanks Martin!"

1856,313763,68456974,2016-04-05,12964264,Karl,"We stayed nearly two weeks in Martin´s flat in Stockholm in early Spring. Having previously lived many years in Stockholm, I knew right away that Martin´s flat was in a top location. The flat is centrally located and very close to public transportation including busses and subway. Nearby are many trendy restaurants but also supermarkets and stores. Close to the flat is located a chiropractor university where students offer treatment at reduced prices - I had a great great experience there. 

The flat itself is very spacious and confortable with all necessary amenities. I find it ideal for people staying longer periods in Stockholm. I particularly enjoyed the flat´s robot vacuum cleaner - I even decided to purchase one for myself. Martin is very easy going and provided us with all the information and help we needed to have a pleasant stay in Stockholm. When coming to Stockholm again, I will surely try to stay here again!"
1857,313763,70706487,2016-04-19,55093889,Selena,It was a pleasure staying at Martins Appartment in Stockholm. He made it easy from the start! We had everything we needed and were situated in the middle of a beautiful part of town with everything on our doorstep. Wonderful!
1858,313763,72140394,2016-05-01,63499090,James,Loved our stay! The location cannot be beat. Central to restaurants and shopping. Located at the corner of Odenplan so access to buses and the subway is so convenient. Large space with everything you need. Also the balcony provides a great view of the area. As for Martin he is wonderful. Very helpful with any questions you have. Provides a list of places to see or eat at which was extremely helpful.
1859,313763,88883450,2016-07-25,19698164,Cheryl," Martin was a great host I had to text/email him a few times over the 10 weeks I stayed -  and he always got back to be quickly (and forgave me when a plant fell off the window sill and the pot shattered - but I found another pot and the plant survived! ) The location was perfect for me - since I needed to walk to Karolinksa Institute every day. There are 3 grocery stores that were each within 2 blocks (I liked ICA) - and TONS of restaurants and coffee houses that are really close - 2 coffee places just around the corner.   This place is in THE BEST location - not too much traffic noise - but close to EVERYTHING - esp. via the subway - 2 stops to central station.   The subway station /buses were right across the street - just steps away. Big screen TV has TIVO and tons of station many of them in English.  I loved the place and Martin was a really great host  very helpful and quick to reply if I had a question.   dates of my stay: May 16-July 25, 2016"

The location is fantastic, 3 stops on the Metro from the central station and a 10/15 min walk from the centre. There are shops, restaurants and cafes close by and the view from the balcony is great. There is plenty of space and the apartment has a cosy homely feel. Had a really enjoyable time in Stockholm, it is a beautiful city."
1874,313763,123243355,2016-12-28,85846890,Maureen,"Martin is a fabulous host!  He is exceptionally responsive to emails/texts, very friendly and positive, empathetic to the needs of travelers, and provides a wealth of information about the area for his visitors.

Martin's place is wonderfully located in a very nice neighborhood, really close to grocery markets, coffee shops, restaurants, bars, and variety of stores.  Additionally, it is extremely close to public transportation and central to many attractions and areas of interest in Stockholm!

The apartment is well stocked for anyone who would like to cook, as we did on Christmas Day.  It is furnished very comfortably and attractively.  The view from the patio is pretty, and it provides a relaxing outdoor sitting space.

This was my first Airbnb experience, and it exceeded my expectations.  I would definitely recommend this apartment and Martin!"

I had a delayed flight and Martin was very easy to coordinate with and ready to answer to the messages. Once arrived he showed the house, the kitchen and gave a list of recommended restaurants in Stockholm.
I stayed there three days, but had to leave one day earlier for unexpected work reasons. Martin did not accept to modify my booking (as Airbnb offered), he said that nobody could book that room two days before because it was too late. It was only around 30eur but could understand his position.
There was also another person in the apartment who was sleeping on the couch, I didn’t know, so the bathroom was shared by three people."

The host is generous and welcoming, offering plenty of local tips and some nice conversation. The apartment is perfectly located within walking distance of the centre of the city - just steps away from a major train line as well.

The flat is much more than a usual Airbnb. It has a grill in the balcony, coffee machine in the kitchen, spices, a full set of kitchen utensils, big wardrobes, etc. Everything you can ask for and more. He was very polite and was easy to reach. We spent some time in the balcony and it gets the perfect afternoon sun. Overall, everything about the flat was perfect. I would suggest it to anyone who is considering to stay."

1890,313763,520375290,2019-08-30,4798865,Nigel,"This is a shared apartment experience, but Martin is a quintessential European and is both welcoming and provides great tips on the area. The place is clean and has all the conveniences one needs.

The location and proximity to the local T station is really a huge plus. The room itself is on the smaller side and this is a reflection of the building being quite historic. 

Would definitely stay again if I was on a business trip in Stockholm."

1894,338470,1041908,2012-03-25,1140923,Roy,"Very nice and quiet spot in a very posh area. about 10 min. walking from center. Be careful if you like to sleep late, as the window shades don't really help, but overall it wasn't that big of a deal. 
 would recommend for couples, not for families ( no cots etc..)"
1895,338470,1104818,2012-04-10,936507,Louise,"Our stay at Gustaf's apartment could not have been better. Great location, great size, super secure, comfy bed, excellent shower and awesome communication. Gustaf was away for the w'end but his girlfriend met us to hand over keys (even though we were more than 40 mins late) and passed on local information and some handy maps and pamphlets Gustaf had left behind for us. 

I'll be recommending this place to all my friends and family who visit Stockholm. "

1898,338470,1233907,2012-05-06,811008,Erika,"Gustaf was a great host. He communicated well with us and provided a clean and spacious apartment.  

We found the bed to be a little tight for two people and the comforter was a little too small, but otherwise the apartment was great.  It is very close to a metro station, so it was a good base for exploring Stockholm. 

I would definitely recommend staying with Gustaf!"

Great location, just a couple minutes from the subway and a quick ride into any other fun part I the city you might want to visit.

Gustaf also took the time to pass along some really good insider info on Stockholm that was much appreciated. I would definitely stay again."
1904,338470,23666319,2014-12-07,23262867,Tommi,"We stayed at Gustaf's for a weekend break and he was amazing. Our flight landed after 11pm - but he was fine to let us in after midnight and greeted us with a warm reception and sat down and had a chat with us. He provided us with his very handy pocket book which had maps of the various areas in Stockholm with places of interest, and some of his favourite places highlighted. 

As for the apartment, we wanted to move in it was so nice! It was a creative space but also felt very homely, with candles and ornaments. Gustaf keeps it in great condition as well and offered tea and coffee and fresh towels. Where the apartment was situated was great for us, quiet and safe and we could walk everywhere we wanted to go, but the station isn't far either."

Gustav is a really creative man, he's got wonderful taste in little things, it all made his apartment a great, cozy and interesting place where you would lose yourself for a week, reading books about contamporary art and design, playing music (he has a guitar and some other stuff), cooking food (there is a shop near the house). Also it took us just 15 minutes to walk to the Downtown. Thanks, Gustav. "

We really think one of the reasons our stay was so great was because of this beautiful apartment and the recommendations Gustaf gave us. The pictures match with the reality. It is a very cozy place right in the heart of Stockholm which is very convenient since the metro is quite expensive. The buildings of the  neighbourhood are impressive and it has everything you need nearby: nice restaurants, a supermarket, bike rental, ... Moreover, Gustaf was very attentive and kind.

It was very quiet and safe residential area that has convenient subway location and it connects all the important places!! 
Although it is not in the city center, if you have 1-day pass for subway, you will be satisfied with location.

The size and furnishings of Lounge, bedroom, kitchen and bathroom are perfect and all maintained clean. the location is central only 2 stops from the central station. The checkin and checkout process were smooth. The flat is in 1st floor but has tiny elevator perfect for suitcases and prams. The bed was comfortable to sleep. The location was decent and supermarkets and metro closeby. All in all highly recommended."
1923,343925,3123332,2012-12-20,3988140,Vlad,"Annika is a great host. She was flexible with the check-in time, which was very helpful. The apartment is located in a good area and very well connected to public transportation.  The flat was very clean and had everything you need, well equipped kitchen, WiFi, TV,  tourist info, balcony for people who smoke. (December 2012)"
1924,343925,3262287,2013-01-04,3868995,Cécile,"We stayed a couple of days at Annika's flat. It was really kind to Annika to come and meet us at the bus stop. Her flat is very welcoming, comfortable and clean. The neighborhood is nice and convenient. We highly recommend Annika, she is a great host."
1925,343925,3756194,2013-03-11,5266082,Evane,"Annik was a great host. Very flexible with arrival and departure time.
The appartment is very well located in Stockholm and it is easy to go to Gamla Stan by walk.
We had a very nice stay!"

I would definitely come back here again!
SUPER HIGLY RECOMMENDED!

1927,343925,4447510,2013-05-06,5352935,Jenny,"Our stay in Annika´s Apartment was very nice and cozy. Everything was clean, the kitchen was well equipped and Annika/ her friend were very helpful. The location of the Apartment was perfect, just 20 Minutes walk to the centre but in the neighbourhood you can find everything such as Pubs, supermarkets, banks, stores and even a Mc Donalds, which is open during the night. :-) 
I would definitely recommend Annika´s Accomodation.  "
1928,343925,5634970,2013-07-09,5918649,Svenja,Our stay in Stockholm was amazing and a great share of it was due to Annika's super cozy flat and wonderful hospitality. The apt was clean and equipped with everything one needs to feel at home away from home. We were very suprised that Annika even picked us up from the train station and then took her time to tell us a lot about the city and where to go. Would definitely recommend to stay with her!
1929,343925,5986565,2013-07-25,6958629,Patricia,"We had a great time in Stockholm. Annika's flat is really well located and calm. Although we couldn't meet her (only stay two days), she organized everything well, her friend was there to give us the keys and explain us everything we needed."
1930,343925,6529259,2013-08-16,5841944,Elisabetta,"We spent six night & days in Annika's flat. The apartment is very clean, comfortable and well reflected by the pictures and its description. The living room is quite spacious, while the kitchen and the bathroom serve their purpose rather well although they are not very large. In the whole the apartment was larger than we expected, very well equipped and we were definitely very pleased during all our stay.
In addition the flat is located in a pretty quite area just five minutes from the Fridhemsplan T-bana (the nearest subway), which on its turn is just 2 or 5 stops from T-centralen (depending on the line you choose) or, if you prefer, just 20-30 minutes by walk from it. We did not explore very much the surrounding area, but if you plan to dine at home as we did, you can buy food in a well stocked Coop supermarket right next to the T-bana (which closes at 9 pm if we well remember).
Lastly, Annika was a delicious host: she provided us with plenty of information, she waited for us at the exit of the subway (even if we arrived quite late in the evening), she provided us with a hair dryer and she allowed us to leave our luggage at home until noon on our last day. She also messaged us a couple of times during the week in order to know if everything was ok."
1931,343925,6782849,2013-08-25,7071521,Robert Turley,"Stockholm has turned out to be one of my favorite places to visit, fresh, clean, and interesting. Annika's apartment was equally as pleasant for us. It was easy to find, very clean, close to food stores and other shopping, easy access to public transportation, and she is quick to communicate. There is a plethora of tourist information available at her place. She met us on arrival at the apartment, showed us around, and answered our questions. There are washers and dryers in the basement that can be used at certain times, which is very convenient.

We arrived at Arlanda airport and took the bus into town, it is the least expensive way to travel to town and probably as fast as the train. It also has free wireless which was good enough to make (Hidden by Airbnb) calls with while we headed downtown. You get off the bus at St. Eriksplan and can walk to the apartment in about 10 minutes, or take the metro right from the bus stop to within two or three blocks of the apartment. As an alternative a cab from St. Eriksplan charges about 90 kroner.

There is a great Pakistan restaurant on Sankt Eriksgatan between Annika's apartment and the St. Eriksplan bus stop, called ""Little Pakistan"" --- definitely worth a visit.

We loved walking from Annika's across to the pedestrian shopping street which leads all the way into the old city, where you find many interesting sights including the royal palace, Pulitzer Museum, and numerous places to eat and drink.

Thanks Annika, hope to see you again."
1932,343925,6936384,2013-08-31,7274427,Damir,Our stay in Stockholm was great. Even though we've been there for three nights we really felt like home. Apartment is well-located (2 minutes from Subway and Bus stops) in a calm area. It's clean and comfortable. Annika provided all information required for those who first time in Stockholm. It was great!
1933,343925,7696534,2013-09-30,927470,Adrienne,Annika was very friendly and hospitable. We enjoyed that the place was close to the subway. We were able to find everything we needed. It was the perfect place to rent for a couple on a weekend. Annika even kindly accommodated an extra guest at the last minute. I would definitely stay with her again.
1934,343925,7828356,2013-10-05,680540,Matthew,"Staying at Annika’s place is a great way to visit Stockholm!  The space is on the small side, but it provided a cozy place to crash in the evening and contained the cooking essentials.  The layout is a square that’s divided into smaller rooms.  The neighborhood and building were quiet and felt safe.  Annika was a very helpful, welcoming host and was there to greet us when we arrived.  She also had a huge stack of brochures and maps from past visitors that provided a lot of information about the sites of the city.  We stayed for 4 nights and so invested in the Stockholm card, which afforded us free entrance to most museums, free bus/subway transit, and a boat tour (highly recommend!).  The apartment’s location was far enough from city center to feel calm and not touristy, while also being close enough to walk to Norrmalm, Gamla Stan, and Hornstull.  There are 2 subway stops within a few blocks of the building and the Flygbussarna from Arlanda has a stop just a 5-minute walk away.  There are several grocery stores around the corner and we enjoyed meals at two local restaurants: Bee’s Thai on Kungsholmsgatan and Formaggio Pizzeria on Fleminggatan (they had gluten free crust).  Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Annika’s place: a cozy space with the essentials for a short stay, an accessible location, and a friendly host.

*If you are a coffee drinker, ask Annika about this before you stay.  We couldn’t find anything for brewing coffee and ended up buying a cheap pour-over cone."
1935,343925,8209959,2013-10-21,8030518,Marianne,"We stayed in annikas flat 3 nigths. Perfect placed, close to everything. We rented bikes, the perfect way to explore Stockholm. Annika was nice and helpful, and we recommed it. "

1938,343925,9551977,2014-01-02,6703705,Bettina,"Our stay at Annika's flat was very enjoyable and coming ""home"" felt good every time. Annika is a lovely host, she was not in town during our stay, but always available and provided useful advice in various ways to make sure we do not miss a thing. She is the first person I would contact if I got another chance to visit Stockholm (definitely worth a trip in spring/summer, too ;o) or recommend to friends travelling there. One of the reasons I loved the place was the comfy bed. Being in a quiet neighborhood and yet just a few steps away from lots of shops, buses and Underground was prettyj close to priceless, too. Thanx again&GOTT NYTT ÅR! to our friendly host."
1939,343925,12016296,2014-04-21,7270509,Ivana,"We were very satisfied with Annika's appartment, it is at a great location, with metro station just around the corner, not far away from main bus station by foot either, in a calm area, tidy,comfortable and convenient, with well equipped kitchen (though we didnt cook at all), just what we needed for our short stay in Stockholm. The only thing is that I wouldn't recommend it for more than 2 guests, because it was really difficult to inflate the airbed without the electric air pump...or it's just us being clumsy :D 
Annika was very welcoming (we arrived before the check in time because of our flight ) and helpful. I recommend her place.
"
1940,343925,12787264,2014-05-11,6293004,Yue,"A little bit far away from central station, and I was told the bed would be 1.5m width, but clearly it was not...
The room was not very warm since the very cold wether when we stayed in Stockholm..."
1941,343925,13479818,2014-05-28,2698164,Ochen,"We stayed at Annika’s place for five days and had a great time. The apartment is in a great location, just a few blocks from two subway lines, two grocery stores, and lots of shopping and eating options. Annika was very welcoming, and the place was a sweet base from which to explore the city. We’d definitely recommend staying there. "
1942,343925,14912159,2014-06-29,6439465,Nir,"Annika apartment is very cosy, clean and nice to stay. The bed was comfort, the shower was clean with hot water also the kitchen is clean and well arranged. The apartment is 2 stops from T-Central station by metro, but the metro stations are big and crowded. Near the place there is a big supermarket and mall and restaurants and local bar. Annika is very nice. good communication and very easy to sort things out like taking the key or checking out. 
We enjoy our stay an Annika apartment.       "
1943,343925,15952626,2014-07-19,14638052,Sanne,Nice and cosy apartment. The apartment was very clean en the host was very nice. She Also had a big stack of brochures of stockholm!

Calm surrounding, but still very central on Kungsholmen, close to the metro and everything you need. "

1946,343925,31535104,2015-05-06,29170285,Anne ( Louis),"We had a great stay at Annika's apartment. As other guests have pointed out, various grocery stores can be found nearby. Furthermore the apartment is ideally situated near Fridhemsplan subway station, where you can hop on both the green and blue lines. The apartment was cosy and well kept. The bed was a little hard, but big enough - I think 140cm - for 2 people."
1947,347192,22741451,2014-11-13,6798330,Matthieu,"The apartment is beautiful, well decorated and really spacious.

The apartment is very clean and beautifully decorated. There is much more seating than what is shown in the pictures, including a table for dining for 4. It was the perfect size for myself, my partner, and the other couple we were traveling with. Matilda was very sweet and quick to respond to any question we had before and during our stay! "
1951,347192,23690261,2014-12-08,22626013,Tatyana,The apartment was was very spacious. It had a lovely fireplace. In a great location close to the metro and walking distance to Old Town.  Matilda was very friendly and gave wonderful suggestions for local attractions.

We enjoyed getting the ferry across to Skansen to go to the amazing park there, with a wonderful christmas market! Very clean apartment, like someone mentioned before there is now a very comfy sofa! Cool interior design too. Thanks so much for letting us stay!!"
1953,347192,24195208,2014-12-22,23731562,Bianca & Arvid,"Well-located out of the ""tourist hub"" of Stockholm. Clean towels and clean linen on arrival although apartment and bathroom could do with a clean. A comfy living area to ""feel at home"" and enjoy a cooked meal with friends. Better for families with small children than four adults as second room is small. No cupboard space to unpack. Mathilda was efficient and available for any questions. "
1954,347192,24848474,2015-01-03,13604323,Yvonne,"Matilda var mycket tillmötesgående och okomplicerad ,höll vad hon sagt , tider mm 
Hon har en fin liten lägenhet med toppenläge på Söder. Väl utrustat och mysigt Tyst och lugnt, t o m under nyårshelg.
Gångavstånd till tunnelbanan och nära till Södra Station.
Bra läge för krogar och shopping"
1955,347192,25606018,2015-01-20,16825466,New,J ai passé un séjour très agréable dans l appartement qui est idéalement située et très confortable. 
1956,347192,25799240,2015-01-26,24512854,Jelger,"Good neighbourhood to stay at. Well located and near everything you could need. Mathilda was available for all our questions via text. Info could have been a bit more but still it was more than plenty for us. Apartment could be a bit better cleaned though, because there were (although they were clean) dishes lying around and also a dirty towel in the bathroom and a stinky cheese in the fridge. For the rest everything was great. Apple TV for good comfort was a nice add on as well. All in all, happy with our stay. "
1957,347192,26418146,2015-02-12,16315401,Chris,"We didn't get to meet Matilda, but communication with her was easy (via SMS, Airbnb) nevertheless.  The apartment was as described, and made for an excellent base for our trip, being well located for Sodermalm (our favourite part of Stockholm), and also close to Gamla Stan.  The neighbourhood was full of places to eat, go for coffee, and had amenities like a large well-stocked ICA supermarket and Systembolaget very nearby. The apartment block felt safe, secure, and very quiet.

The apartment was spacious, comfortable and well-enough equipped for 2.  Being frequent tea drinkers, not being able to locate a kettle caused a minor headache, although we were able to heat water on the stove.  The only other minor gripe was a loose curtain rail in the bedroom.  Overall, however, I would highly recommend the apartment, and we were delighted with our choice to stay here."
1958,347192,29976465,2015-04-15,26142239,Robin And Lucien,"We took the express train from the airport and then the subway from the railway station. It was just a short walk from the subway to the apartment. We were met, welcomed and admitted to the apartment and were provided with a good explanation of the facilities. Lovely comfortable apartment which gave us a great base to explore Stockholm. Our host even provided wine which was most welcome!"

1961,347192,36704679,2015-06-30,15671309,Camila,"The apartment was very well located, big and cool decoration. The toilet wasn't too clean and we also missed curtains in the bedroom. Sweden in summer time is very light and that was our biggest problem.."
1962,347192,37320400,2015-07-06,18819838,Alexey,"We liked the flat. 

It`s pretty big especially living room, very cozy and situated very good - 5 minutes walk to metro station and only one stop to Gamla Stan. The supermarket in one minutes walk.

Matilda was very friendly - we arrive and depart late and it wasn`t any problem with it.

The only thing - the second bedroom is very small and may be not very conveniend for the second couple but if you are traveling with a child I think it`s OK. 

So we had a good time in the flat and could recomend it. "
1963,347192,40326353,2015-07-30,34125509,Maria,"It was our first time in Stockholm and our first time traveling with Airbnb. We were a little bit nervous, but entering the apartment of Hadrien was like entering our apartment! We felt like being home!

The apartment is well situated - in the heart of the student district - with a lot of bars, restaurants and shops. 

Thanks for making our trip so fantastic!"

Une des chambres un peu petite. Attention: pour les visiteurs français sachez qu'il n'y a ni volet ni rideau pour fermer les fenêtres la nuit: mais on s'y fait. Quartier agréable et bien placé. Immeuble propre et silencieux."
1970,347192,71424498,2016-04-25,12004910,Sara,"Matilda's flat is gorgeous and bright, as the pictures show.  Its in a great location close to Slussen station and lots of shops.  She kindly allowed my friend and I to bring our 9 month old babies. Communication was good between us and Matilda was helpful with any questions I had.   Unfortunately the second bedroom is without a door or curtain.  "
1971,347192,74895283,2016-05-17,35999132,James,"Tilda made sure we had easy access to the apartment key on arrival, left a welcome note and a bottle of prosecco and coffee for us which was a nice touch.

The apartment was in a good area, with many cafes, shops, bars etc. easily walkable or very short Uber rides away. A convenience store a few meters away was also very useful.

The actual apartment was as described, although the second bedroom is small and probably not large enough for a couple. There is also no wardrobe in the second room so we used a rail in the entrance hall which wasn't a problem.

Tilda was available on text and I asked her a couple of questions, to which I received an almost immediate response.

All in all, a good stay for the price paid. I'd recommend it!



"
1972,347192,78230453,2016-06-05,27119995,Keijo,Matilda is a great communicator and very helpful host. My late arrival was no problem for her as she arranged keys to be ameasily accessible when I got there. The apartment is on a quiet street very close to all the fun sodermalm activities.  The place could have used a proper hoovering before our arrival but that did not bother us too much.
1973,347192,93472582,2016-08-13,5082775,Ana,"I enjoyed my stay at Tilda's place hugely. Her flat is beautifully decorated, spacious and had everything we needed during our trip. Tilda was also very accommodating of our late check-in time. I would definitely recommend this flat to anyone travelling to Stockholm."
1974,347192,98044626,2016-08-29,3498725,Dylan,"We spent three nights at Tilda's apartment, two couples fit easily. It's in a great part of Sodermalm. The communication prior to arrival was a struggle however, when considering; location, value for money compared to a hostel/ hotel and quality, everything was very good. Thank you. "
1975,347192,101164664,2016-09-12,35399405,Alise And Ivar,"This place is charming, nice and clean. We enjoyed staying here for our weekend in Stockholm. Its very central - short distances to everything you need. Nice area. Communication with Tilda was also great. Wifi didnt work, but we didnt really make a lot of effort to try to fix it. We had a lovely weekend, and would definitely recommend it to others. "
1976,347192,120575043,2016-12-11,44139938,Claude,"Very beatiful apartment in a nice and really calm district. Tilda made us feel comfortable and was very attentive, thank you.
The smaller bed is quite narrow for two adults. For three adults, the appartment is perfect. For four adults, two should be used to sleep in a not so wide bed."
1977,347192,121653812,2016-12-18,29143048,Sofie,"The apartment did not answer our expectations at all. We had expected something cleaner. 
There were NO instructions whatso ever : about trash management, buses, a map of Stockholm eventually, . instructions on washing machine, welcome word. "
1978,347192,124916418,2017-01-03,96570453,Severino,"The apartment is really beautiful and cosy. We where 4 people and we really enjoyed our time there. We had more than enough space and the apartment was very clean. Södermalm is the best part of Stockholm. It is very lively, modern close to the historic center and still in short distance to Djurgarden. There are also a lot of nice restaurants and coffeeshops, shops and musuems around, so you will never be bored. Only a few meters from the apartment you will find many nice viewing points on the old part of Stockholm.
The communication with Tilda was simple and friendly. She responded to all our questions and made our stay as easy and comfortable as possible. 
I can only recommend anyone to stay at this apartment to experience Stockholm at its best."

It’s filled with Pinterest-perfect potted plants, vintage lamps, design books and iconic pieces of furniture artfully blended together. "
1986,347192,356957178,2018-12-09,143293077,Pierre-Emmanuel,"Ideally located, clean, confortable and Matilda is very reactive.
The extra room is small but confortable.
Would book it again."

1988,357012,1266780,2012-05-12,1906750,Thomas,"A beautiful, neat and modern apartment with lots of space and light. We loved staying there and enjoyed the view and the neighborhood. Worked well for three people, could work just as well if you are a family with two kids.  "
1989,357012,1316280,2012-05-21,1908008,Jonathan,Gorgeous and very clean apartment right near fun restaurants and awesome brunch spot (the strand).  Would recommend this apartment and checking out and staying Sodermalm when visiting Stockholm.
1990,357012,13907029,2014-06-08,11794754,Jules,"We loved Calle's apartment. Bright, spacious, trendy with a beautiful glimpse of the sea and all the boats. Located a short walk to the Hornstull metro and the airport bus. Close to lots of great restaurants, an organic grocery store, bars and an awesome children's park. And of course the water. Calle is a great guy and an excellent communicator. "
1991,357012,16602575,2014-07-30,12890571,Maro,"We (four adults) stayed at Calle's apartment for a week and had a great time. The apartment is filled with sunlight, is furnished with lots of nice swedish design pieces and has a great kitchen which we didn't use much as there are great restaurants just around the corner. Calle provided us with a great list with tipps on what to see and do in Stockholm. Although we didn't meet Calle and his family in person I can recommend him and his place as he seems to be a really nice guy and a great communicator. Thank you for having us! We'd love to come back one day."
1992,357012,16896376,2014-08-04,3397364,Martin,"We totally agree with the description of the other guests. The only thing we might add, is the refreshing and relaxing atmosphere of the appartement. It is even enhancing your mood. We would like to come back."
1993,357012,40935875,2015-08-03,8221569,Michael,"We really enjoyed our stay at Calles beautiful apartment. It's very comfortable, our 2-years-old daughter loved it. The area is also great we loved the Hornstull street market on Sundays with the food trucks. I can only recommend to stay there if you like to visit the city."
1994,357012,58366378,2016-01-02,10616743,Philip,"The apartment is fantastic, and in a great location. We had no problems getting there and no problems with the apartment. Calle is a good host and responded to our questions promptly. He even left us some Swedish Christmas drinks when we arrived on Christmas. I definitely recommend this place to any one who wants to visit Stockholm.  "
1995,357012,59158804,2016-01-07,17601865,David,"Lägenheten var ljus, ren, vacker och välkomnande. Värden svarade fort och var mycket trevlig att ha att göra med. 

Vi är väldigt nöjda och kan verkligen rekommendera detta boende."
1996,357012,85415498,2016-07-11,40281281,Will,"We had a wonderful three days at Calles place in Stockholm. Was even more beautiful in person. Calles wife was there to greet us and explain all the specifics we needed about the apartment. And a lovely bottle of wine as a welcoming gift -- unexpected and very appreciated. The apartment has wonderful light and very relaxing. Close to a small park area (5 minutes walking) with great views of the City Hall and Old Town. The metro station is less than 10 minutes walk. Everything worked as described. 

We were a family of three (two adults and one child) and the place was a perfect size to have both group and alone time. 

Some things to remember:

1. Elevator is small -- 3 people max without luggage
2. Stove is amazingly fast to heat water or make coffee -- just get a quick lesson on the operation
3. Washer and dryer worked great -- if you can't read Swedish, you might need to look up the instructions on the Internet

Thanks again Calle, would stay there again on another trip to Stockholm!"
1997,357012,87128360,2016-07-18,66729527,Tone,"Leiligheta er lys og luftig, med alt vi måtte behøve av diverse utstyr til en barnefamilie. Både vi og barna er kjempe fornøyde med både leilighet og nærområde. Lekeplassen med plaskedam og strandområdene var fantastisk. Leiligheta var ren og klargjort til vi kom, og veldig behagelig og stilig innredet. "
1998,357012,90908148,2016-08-02,20924953,Karianne,"My parents came to Stockholm from Australia and stayed at Calle's place for 2 weeks. They loved the apartment. High-ceilinged, light and airy, it was perfectly located (there's a bus stop right outside where they could take bus no 66 to and from) with a lovely view. Their grandson (my 2-year old son) enjoyed staying over too as it's a great apartment for kids. They also really appreciated the flexibility Calle showed in adjusting both check in and check out time to correspond with their flights. The pictures do not do the apartment justice, it looks even better and larger in  real life! Would definitely stay here again."
1999,357012,123206385,2016-12-28,17255866,Sophia,"Wir würden mit pfefferkuchen und einer Flasche Wein empfangen. Die Wohnung strahlt eine unglaubliche Wärme aus und ist für 5 Personen geräumig genug. Die Wohnküche und die sofaecke mit Kamin ist sogar gemütlicher als auf den Fotos. Von der Wohnung hat man einen tollen Ausblick aufs Meer und die Schären! Möglichkeiten zum Einkauf und eine busstation direkt vor der Tür. Die Umgebung ist sehr ruhig und wunderschön, spaziermöglichkeiten direkt ums eck. "
2000,357012,124587345,2017-01-02,97374490,Marilyn,"Our family if four stayed at Calle's place for 4 nights over New Year's weekend. Great views of New Year's Eve fireworks. Everything was as advertised, even better. We would recommend it to anyone visiting Stockholm. Very nice location and close to T-bana so easy to get anywhere in the city."
2001,357012,176466223,2017-07-31,12225239,Rikard,"Calle and family were superb hosts and the apartment is fantastic.  Great location as well with restaurants, shops, great playgrounds, and public beaches within easy walking distance. "

2003,357012,296541780,2018-07-26,21811333,Jeremy,Calle’s light and stylish apartment is in a great location on Södermalm - within easy reach of the centre but also close to the Mälarstrand waterfront and the wooded Island of Långholmen (good swimming). We did not meet Calle and family but communications were excellent. I can highly recommend Calle’s place. We hope we can return.
2004,357012,490324945,2019-07-18,266312475,Rune,"Great Apartment! Perfect location in a quiet, yet central area with easy commute to the city.

Lägenheten ligger väldigt bra, det bästa läget på Södermalm med både nära till havet och tunnelbana. Lägenheten är ljus, väldigt fräsch och stilren. Det var också bra och smidig kommunikation med värden."

2007,368952,1248188,2012-05-08,2118315,Alexandra,"Very nice, helpful and hospitable host with an adorable dog! Not very practical location to get to the centre/airport, so it might not be the best idea if you come for a day. The area is very green and you can go for refreshing, and scenic walks in the forest. The house is very nice and cosy. Also keep in mind that there is no bathroom in the garden shed, so you have to go in and out of the house."
2008,368952,1281884,2012-05-14,1481083,Thomas,"I had a very pleasant stay with Madeleine and her family. She is a very cultivated, kind and helpful host, who goes the extra mile to make the guest feel welcome. 

I can only give my best recommendation after staying here. If you like dogs – you will furthermore get welcomed by sweetest Cocker Spaniel :o) Enjoy your stay – Thomas Vandsted"
2009,368952,1422485,2012-06-05,1576807,Michael,"Great host!  I had a tremendous time here.  ""Modern villa"" is an understatement.  You feel like your in the Royal palace with all of the adornments.  The place is very clean in a comfortable setting (especially the bed).  The place is better than the pictures provided. Mrs Bohman was very kind and helpful.  It was very easy to feel at home here.
    You are about 300 meter from the bus stop which takes 26 minute (according to the schedule) to get to the southern most main station of Stockholm. The neighborhood is a modern upscale residential suburb.  There is a separate cottage in the rear of the house that has one small room with a very comfortable bed.  This place comes highly recommended! "
2010,368952,1439150,2012-06-08,2389683,Yick Ho Alex,"Very nice host, Absolutely recommended. The whole environment of the house is great. Madeleine picked us at the central station on that day. She also did a small tour around the city. Besides, she made us the dinner and breakfast. They are perfect! A active doggy and a lovely child in the house. We enjoyed to stay with her family. I hope we can stay longer in her house. 100% Recommended!"
2011,368952,1651516,2012-07-07,2245091,Kelly,"Stockholm is a beautiful city with soooo much to see and do.  Madeleine became family almost instantly.  She is truly an openhearted and loving person, not to mention a fantastic host.
My son and I had a wonderful time at her place and great conversations regarding the world and Sweden.
I can hardly wait to come back and visit my new friend.

Aucun regret! A refaire"
2013,368952,5035206,2013-06-09,5234651,Matthew,"Madeleine was a truly kind and attentive host during my six-week stay in Stockholm. Her home is conveniently located south of the city center, about 30 min by bus. There is a beautiful lake with hiking trails nearby (15 min walk) as well as a supermarket and other shops (10 min walk). If you like to cycle, the ride into town is very nice as well. All in all, a great location for exploring Stockholm and the surrounding area. Enjoy your travels!"
2014,368952,5150135,2013-06-15,749143,Liam,"Madeleine's house is beautifully located, in the forest outside Stockholm. She is a lovely, friendly hostess and makes her guests very welcome.She collected me from the Metro station and brought me to the shopping centre/supermarket. She also very kindly worked out my transport routing using local transport services - these are very efficient but not user-friendly for foreigners so Madeleine's help was invaluable. The accommodation was very comfortable - it was private but Madeleine allows her guests to make full use of her main house. "
2015,368952,7064477,2013-09-05,4352321,Annie,Madeleine is a wonderful host. She will put a ton of special attentions and efforts to make you feel welcomed & right at home. The guest house is perfectly cozy and the pictures don't do justice to this beautiful villa. A beyond amazing experience ! 
2016,368952,7876166,2013-10-07,6734834,Daniel,"Madeleine has always been a big help when it came to recommendations about places to visit. Not a typical swede in a positive way as she is a very open and talkative person! 
Bus connection to the city is pretty good (24/7) regarding the distance. The villa itself is perfectly modern equipped and the garden house offers the possibility for withdrawal and privacy. Madeleine also has bikes to rent out - a nice bonus considering the nature around!"
2017,368952,12421232,2014-05-02,7365593,Luke,"Madeleine is very friendly and warm, easy going and very helpful. She did her best to make my stay perfect, I would recommend staying with Madeleine to anyone. The location is beautiful, and with good connections to the city. The guesthouse is private and cosy, the villa is furnished like the Palace of Versailles! She has a super dog as well. "
2018,368952,14546257,2014-06-22,10903660,Lisa,"Madeleine has been a wonderful host, always nice, open-minded and talkactive. you shouldn't miss her awesome insider tips for your stay in Stockholm! Getting to the city is quite easy as well, as the bus goes quite frequently directly to Slussen. I really enjoyed my stay at Madeleine's and I would definitely recommend her! Thank you so much, madeleine :)"
2019,368952,16305023,2014-07-25,14653613,Levente,"Here in neighborhood houses style is like in USA.  No fences. Located for forest.

Breakfast just after arrived at location. One time.

No access see TV. She said to me: ""stai at your room.""

Anything else is good. I have all I need . Very good bed. I use free bike. I so happy to biking in  Älta.  Good comunication. Dog and cat is so friendly. "
2020,368952,43650248,2015-08-21,38523551,Robert,A friend and I spent two nights at Madeleines house and felt welcome. She has a very cosy an comfortable place. We were allowed to help ourselfes and she even invited us to have a bbq with her.  I would definetely recommend staying at her place!
2021,368952,44253438,2015-08-24,9815468,Fernando,"Madeleine is a great host and a great person! I had a good time at Madeleine's place and it was lovely to meet Leon, Maruska and the cat. She was very supportive all the time.. she pick me up and drop me at T-Centrale, which was very convenient as I travel with a bike case for an sporting competition. Her house is very nice and it is easy to feel like in home. The neighbourhood (Älta) has a very good bike lane to get into Stockholm if you want to do some exercise or save some money on transportation. She has multiple bikes that you can borrow. "

Madeleine und ihr Ehemann haben mich sehr herzlich willkommen geheißen. 
Ich habe für einen Monat das Gästehaus gebucht. Durch den Monatsrabatt kam ich auf 23€ die Nacht. Das Gästehaus ist eine sehr kleine Holzhütte, die mit dem Nötigsten ausgestattet war. Die Hütte steht in einem kleinen Wald, in dem man nichts, außer die Vögel zwitschern, hört. Im Häuschen war ein mittelgroßes Bett, ein Schreibtisch, zwei Möbelstücke für Kleidung, eine kleine Küchenzeile und eine Chemietoilette ohne Spülung. Fließend warmes Wasser gab es nicht, ich musste im Haupthaus Wasser in einen Behälter füllen und diesen wieder in die Hütte tragen. Geplant war, dass meine Freundin 3 Wochen später nach reist, sie hat die Reise letztendlich abgesagt, weil die eben genannten Dinge, nicht in der Anzeige hervorgegangen sind. In der Anzeige gab es nur Bilder vom Haupthaus, sodass wir ausgegangen sind, dass das unser Wohnbereich wird. Wir hatten dadurch auch in Kauf genommen, dass das Haus außerhalb des Stadtzentrums ist. Denn für ein paar Euro mehr kann man in einem Hostel fließendes, warmes Wasser, beziehen, hat eine Toilette, die spült und muss nicht alles zum Schluss reinigen. Wenn man das Gästehaus mietet, muss man sich bewusst sein, dass man die Toilette reinigen muss, sobald man sie benutzt. Das war ein Erlebnis, dass ich nicht noch einmal wiederholen möchte. 
 Das Gästehaus ist für jene gut geeignet, die auf jeglichen Luxus verzichten können und sich mit der Natur sehr verbunden fühlen. 

Das war meine erste und sehr lehrreiche Erfahrung mit Airbnb.  "
2023,368952,105237548,2016-10-01,63913096,Michael,"Ich habe vom 15. August bis zum 30.September bei Madeleine gewohnt. Meine Unterkunft war ein umgebautes Gartenhaus, ca. 20m² groß. Es gab zwei Herdplatten, eine Mikrowelle, Besteck und Geschirr. Allerdings nur eine Art Plumpsklo, keine Dusche und kein fließend Wasser. Für eine Dusche, oder um die Wassergefäße zu füllen, musste ich in das Haupthaus, indem Madeleine mit ihrem Sohn, ihrem Hund und ihrer Katze lebt. Des Weiteren muss man relativ weit zu Fuß zur nächsten Bushaltestelle gehen (10min). Das Gartenhaus ist gemütlich, direkt am Wald und sauber. Da ich auch einen Schlüssel in das Haupthaus hatte, war Duschen, Abspülen etc. kein größeres Problem. Das Internet war sehr schlecht, auch die Ausstattung erschien mir etwas sporadisch. Also insgesamt mehr ein Camping-Erlebnis, aber das ist ja nicht schlecht. Madeleine ist eine sehr nette Person, sie hat mir den Aufenthalt sehr angenehm gestaltet (ich konnte zum Beispiel mein Auto noch zwei Tage länger auf dem Grundstück parken)"

2031,370744,114540538,2016-11-19,100363762,Maxine,This apartment is located near a lot of local and also tourist spots. The metro station is right next to the flat so it's extremely convenient.

2036,385701,37278512,2015-07-06,22288331,Lena,Familj med 2 vuxna och 5 barn hyrde detta radhus 2 veckor i juni 2015. Allt var kanon! 5 min promenad till tunnelbanestationen Farsta och Farsta centrum med affärer man kan tänkas behöva. Fin parklek nära huset. Bra information och trevligt bemötande från Alex. WI-FI funkade bra! Det var skönt att ha diskmaskin och tvättmaskin i huset. Parkeringsplats finns precis utanför huset. Rekommenderas varmt!
2037,385701,43020824,2015-08-17,28516283,Delphine,"Even if we had not the opportunity to meet Alex and his family, our week in their beautiful house in Farsta was really great and they have left us all necessary informations.
Neighbourhood are really nice and calm. Our children had especially loved  kids playground in the park and the proximity of the lake. 
It is not far from Stockholm with the metro and we easily visit it.
We warmly recommend Alex' house which is really great for a family."
2038,385701,88226320,2016-07-23,2055868,Tijs,"We had a wonderful stay in the stylishly decorated and quiet home of Alex. The house is located in a wonderful green park, with nice neighbours and an all-pedestrian path to the playground, the beach, the metro,… It sits about half an hour from the city centre (walking + metro) but offers a very green surrounding and we had a great time changing city time for trips in the area, f.i. going to farsta strand or hellasgarden.
The house is well equipped and Alex was a kind host, responding to all our questions promptly and although we did not meet in person, we experienced his helpfulness and quick help when we had a small problem with the codelock. "
2039,385701,93702499,2016-08-13,6207054,Hedwig,"We had a wonderful holiday in Alex house - we loved the spatially complex and wonderful house, especially the double height dining space. The kids loved playing in the quiet and green pedestrian way in front of the door. The location was just perfect for exploring Stockholm and the surrounds, a short drive to the coast and to the lakes.
Unfortunately we were not able to meet Alex and his family in person. Communication was great at all times, very friendly and reply quick at all times. Alex is very welcoming, friendly and helpful. We thoroughly enjoyed his recommendations for the neighbourhood and Stockholm.
The house and kitchen are very well equipped, especially for a family with children.
We had an excellent time and hope to visit again in the future. Thanks a lot Alex for having us stay, regards Hedwig

2040,385701,124624837,2017-01-02,96859918,Susanne,"Das Haus liegt in einer sehr lauten Umgebung, nahe der Autobahn.
Die Ausstattung in der Küche ist sehr alt. Die Heizung ist nicht regulierbar und wir haben gefroren. Das Bad ist winzig. Die Bettdecken und Kissen sind in einem furchtbaren Zustand!"
2041,385701,171671414,2017-07-18,37550540,Annick,"Lots of space inside, divided in several areas. Large bedrooms. When we arrived, the house was not entirely clean: dusty surfaces and not so clean carpets. Set in green surroundings, but with a highway in the back and a busy road up front (when you leave the communal area). This is a bit noisy. Playground & Farsta center very nearby. Alex was very responsive whenever we had a problem or question."
2042,385701,177314422,2017-08-02,22293929,Alison,"Alex was always prompt when replying to queries. The public transport system is fantastic in Stockholm ...we went for a week with our sons, aged 14 and 17..so that they could skateboard at the skateboard parks. There is a swimming lake 8 mins away. Alex's home is lovely, very quirky and homely...lots of side lights, so lovely atmosphere. Huge pans for cooking pasta...always a must for our family. "
2043,438129,1395538,2012-06-01,2234204,Geoanna Marie,Eva is such an amazing and wonderful hostess. She is extremely welcoming and helpful the moment you arrive and tells you all the things you need to know about day to day life in Sweden. In just a few weeks her and her girls have become like family to me already and I will miss them all so so much! You will be taken care of very well well at Eva's and she is the absolute most awesome host I've ever had. 
2044,438129,4282892,2013-04-24,4504662,Tran,"She, her husband and kids really nice. This is good place for you stay in long time. I  have been staying here for 40 days and i highly recommend for you come here."
2045,438129,4890153,2013-05-31,5868402,James,"Ea is absolutely the best host. She has been so helpful to me in getting around Sweden, understanding different cultural aspects and giving me random tidbits of information to help make me stay more enjoyable. Her place is near the train station and it is very convenient to get into the center of Stockholm from there. The public transit in and around Stockholm is 1st class so you won't have any trouble getting where you are going. I can't recommend her more highly for your stay!"

I stayed at their place for 25 days and I'm very pleased with my stay - the location is great, just app 20 minutes by tube to the central station, the room is just nice - I did get the best sleep there -, perfect when looking for a nice cosy place where to work. Ea and her family they're by far the nicest, most helpful people one (as a foreigner/tourist) can wish for! 
Thank You! :)"

The communication was fast, organized and easy going which was very helpful.and what a great coincidence we live so close to each other so my mother could visit me in my apartment within a 5 minute walk-great! Thanks Ea and we hope you and your family are fine!"
2049,438129,15975250,2014-07-19,6672878,Ana,"Bon endroit ! The house is Exceptionally clean and tidy at all times. Eva and Douglas are very nice people : they made room for me in the fridge, in the kitchen, in the bathroom... Eva is always smiling and she's a Very thoughtful host. As she had time when I arrived, she picked me and my heavy luggage up from the metro, which I'm very grateful for ! She also spoke Swedish to me, as she knew I was taking a course in the language. I would definitely recommend this room, unless you're very tall, because you might bang your head quite a lot, and unless you're claustrophobic, as the room as no windows ( but it has fans). As there's is a small child in the family, it's also better if you don't need silence all the time (but frankly, I slept well).
For the price of a youth hostel, you get your own room with a desk, internet, cleanliness, access to a kitchen, fresh towels... There's also an ICA grocery store on the way to the metro. Very convenient ! "
2050,438129,18813896,2014-09-01,11577647,Jana,"Ea war eine nette Gastgeberin und ihre Familie ist super freundlich! Sie hat mir gute Tipps gegeben, was ich wo und wie in Stockholm besuchen kann und soll. 
"
2051,438129,20290542,2014-09-27,4467518,Oscar,"Eva is an excellent host, I had a good time during the time that I stayed there.

The room is small but it has all you need to rest and study. The house is clean, with big kitchen which you can use, and it is about 7 min walking from the metro station. Near there a commercial zone where you can find supermarkets and food stores.

I definitely recommend her."
2052,438129,33642268,2015-05-31,24294996,Mattias,"Eva var en väldigt trevlig värd som var snäll och omtänksam. Boendet var trevligt också. 

Rummet var mycket litet, men tillräckligt stort för att göra studier med ett bra skrivbord och en bekväm stol. Något som bör tänkas på dock för andra resenärer som t.ex. behöver arbetsro är att barnen i huset ibland kan vara högljudda (även om de är jättesnälla). Rummet har heller inte några fönster (vilket ses på bilderna), vilket bör uppmärksammas för den som vill se dagsljus ofta. För min del fungerade det dock bra eftersom jag ändå kom hem under kvällen oftast när det var mörkt ute. Sängen var bekväm och man sov gott i rummet.

Huset ligger inom bra avstånd till tunnelbanan och billigare mataffärer nära Hagsätra centrum.

Boendet rekommenderas till den som vill ha ett boende inom fungerande pendlingsavstånd till Stockholm centrum, en trevlig värd och ett stort skrivbord för arbete (men med beaktande av att det finns barn i huset)."
2053,438129,65155248,2016-03-11,51252307,Daniel,"Ea and her family were simply the perfect host, always supportive and providing good advices. House is clean, cosy and close to transportation system. Private room, bathroom. I was simply the perfect stay."
2054,438129,156553009,2017-05-31,122180778,Óscar,"I felt very confortable and really enjoyed my stay there.
Actually, I was treated as a part of the family. We had really interesting conversations along the time I was hosted with them. At the end, I would consider them as my new friends from Stockholm! 
I would completely recommend this family to share home, specially for students and open-minded people.
A lot of facilities were available in the house, which made my stay a nice experience!"
2055,438129,187394184,2017-08-27,38568166,Marita,"Eva-Marie and her family were really great and welcoming to me and I felt like home during my whole stay there. The place is very clean and has everything you need. You can easily ask anything from Eva-Marie, communication worked really well with her.  The house is located in a good and safe neighborhood about 5-10 minutes walk from metro station (Hagsätra), which is great! There is also supermarkets in the metro station so it is easy to buy food to the house. Eva-Marie was also very nice in coming to pick me up from the metro station when I arrived with my two luggages and her husband took me to station when I left, I really appreciated :) All in all, a really awesome stay and highly recommend!"
2056,438129,199893261,2017-10-03,146778843,Arthur,"Eva and Douglas are a very cool familly, they are really nice and will make you feel home. I really had a great month with them!"
2057,438129,278633743,2018-06-18,67598691,Sanne,"I very much enjoyed my stay here. Although the room is rather small, the hospitality of Eva and her family more than makes up for it. The location was perfect for me and provided me with a nice walk to the conference hall (to which Eva drew me a perfect map, so I wouldn't get lost)."
2058,438129,323246493,2018-09-15,98877419,Kostis,"My stay at Eva's place was really enjoyable!
During your stay at their home you will feel as a part of the family! Eva and Douglas are really sweet and easy to talk to but respect your privacy as well! 
The room, as mentioned, is quite small and without windows, close to the other rooms of the house. Nevertheless, after a few days of adjustment I found it cozy and I didn't mind. Keep in mind you are booking a room inside a family's home with children. Personally I found it interesting and hepled me to adjust the first days of my new 2-year stay in Sweden."
2059,438129,407931608,2019-02-03,223124158,John,Allt gick bra hos Evas hus.
2060,438129,431515923,2019-04-01,130949867,Olga,"The house is in a lovely area, very green, the metro is closeby, very easy to get around. The room is small, which in my opinion makes it cozy. Eva and her family have been very helpful and welcoming, I'm really glad I found this place last minute and thankful to them for making my stay so calm and worry-free."
2061,438129,450768000,2019-05-10,63681686,Lucía,"The house is well located near by the green line 30 min from T-centralen. The center of Hagsätra has two supermarkets and some shops like a coffee house and a restaurant. 
The room is really small with no windows but the family makes you feel like home.
I just moved to Sweden and Ea and her husband has helped me to get start it here. They’d gave me a warm welcome to their house and are always willing to help me with any question I have."
2062,438129,520791645,2019-08-31,138898088,David,Eva and her family were really nice and welcoming with me. The room is quite small and you can reach Stockholm center in 40 minutes.
2063,442837,1260177,2012-05-10,1444223,Felix,As described. Comfortable bed. Nice neighborhood. Underground station 1 min away is very convenient. Afternoon sun on the balcony. Happy to recommend!

2068,442837,2233385,2012-09-08,2769433,Gustavo,It was very easy to get here from Stockholm C. The room was perfect and Jo was very polite. I will for sure return to this place next time I am in Stockholm.
2069,442837,2475127,2012-10-01,2638896,Fabien,"This was my first time in Stockholm and only for a couple of days. Jo's appartment is quite central and quiet, fully equiped. The place is a good starting point to travel accross the City. Jo was very friendly and took the time to advice me about what to see/do at night or during the day. The most difficult was to make a choice at the end!"
2070,442837,2974800,2012-11-26,1163027,Fulvio,"I spent three days in Stockholm at the home of Joanna.
She is a girl very friendly, made me feel at ease.
The house is very nice, clean and cozy.
In addition, the last night he has organized a party where I had so much fun.
Jo has some very nice friends.
Thank you so much for your hospitality.
Fulvio"
2071,442837,3054551,2012-12-09,824918,Lampros,"Everything was perfect with Jo and her place!
From the communications at the beginning, till the time of departure.
The flat is placed in a very convenient location, is very modern, very nice, very cosy and so clean. In my opinion is a great choice for accommodation in Stockholm. Jo is a very pleasant, helpful and easygoing host. Totally recommended. "

2073,442837,3329018,2013-01-11,3560830,Kathryn,Had a lovely stay in Jo's place. As Joanna was unable to be at the house I had the pleasure of meeting and discussing the details with jo's mum who was very helpful and accommodating of my arrival and departure times. The house was very tidy and clean and secure location.
2074,442837,3407426,2013-01-24,2769433,Gustavo,This is my second time at this place. The standards are good and neighbourhood is one of the city's most vibrant part. Close a shoping mall and a communcation hub. You can easily travel to the heart to the city and even to the university campus. Jo and her mother were friendly and I did everything to make things easy for me during my staying. I recommend this place.
2075,442837,3656479,2013-02-28,270811,Kyle,"Jo's place was clean and well located.  Her place is only a few stops from Slussen and Gamla Stan, both of which are very close to many sight-seeing opportunities.  It's only a 5 minute walk to the nearest metro station and there's a large shopping center surrounding the stop.  There is a grocery store that is very close which is open until 10PM each night; this is very convenient for times when you need a quick snack or something for dinner late at night.  For the first few days of my stay I didn't see Jo very much since we were both busy.  The last night of my stay though we were able to chat about life in the US and Sweden, some of the things I did while I was there, etc.  She was easy to talk to and was very knowledgable about the area.  I would recommend her place to anyone looking for a place to stay while visiting Stockholm."
2076,442837,3691388,2013-03-04,4171370,Sonja,"I enjoyed staying with Jo. She answered quickly to all my messages and although I was running late from the airport, she was at the flat to let me in. Jo is easy to talk to and very welcoming, she invited me to have breakfast with her, which was very nice. Although I only spend one night at her place, I can recommend this location to anyone travelling to Stockholm."
2077,442837,4476669,2013-05-07,2890824,Héloïse,"Jo's appartment is really spacious and well located ( only 1 minute from the tube station) The place is new, clean and very calm with a lovely balcony. I 've enjoyed my stay at Jo's and her mother is particulaly lovely: she showned me all the places of interrest in Town and indicated me a few internet spots in town 
in case I wanted connections. We even had tea and pastries the morning I left and a had nice chat!! I havn't met Jo because she was off in Peru but I can tell she is a verry nice person thanks to her mum! Stockholm is splendid and I recommand to visit the city and stay at Joana's!"

Convinient to get from and to airport as well as to any other place. Nice appartment. Thanks"
2079,442837,4603246,2013-05-14,6078826,Yuiko,"Jo's apartment was very nice, clean, modern as you can see the pictures! Unfortunately, I was not able to meet Jo since she was in vacation but I was very glad to meet Jo's mom Lidia. She is such a lovely mom! She advised me where I should visit, also how to get the airport :)
The apartment is very nice and I love the terrace! Very convenient to the central station. If you are still looking for the place to stay, definitly recommend Joanna's apartment!
Thank you again to Jo and Lidia :)"
2080,442837,4720826,2013-05-21,6380250,Ainars,"This was my first trip with Aribnb, and it was wonderful. But you all know that already. So, few words about Jo's apartment: first of all, Jo helped me with all the travel details, itinerary, etc., that made it easy to find my way around. The apartment is in a good location well connected to major transport arteries. Downtown just 10 min by metro. The flat itself is very cozy, warm, with lots of light, and you have your privacy. Jo is a great host who loves traveling herself! A recommended shelter."
2081,442837,4763059,2013-05-24,3478979,Nick,"Jo was very helpful with my arrangements as I arrived late in the evening and left early in the morning. 
The apartment is very conveniently located, about five stops from central station.
The whole experience was extremely positive and I would happily recommend Jo's apartment to anyone visiting Stockholm.
"
2082,442837,4934190,2013-06-03,5218483,Adam,"Jo's apartment is a perfect place to stay in Stockholm and she was an excellent host.  It is a lovely apartment, clean, comfortable and I was made to feel very welcome by both Jo and her mother, Lidia who gave me the keys and showed me around.

They were both extremely helpful when I had some issues and I could not think of anywhere better to stay.

Great value and just moments from the metro station and shopping mall."
2083,442837,5002392,2013-06-06,6357071,Farouk,"It was a pleasure staying at Jo's place. Lidia's tips were of great help on where to go and how to get around. The new, sunny and clean apartment is well located and very well deserved by public transport; metro, bus and tram are all indeed within 1 mn reach from  the house and one can even walk to Gamla Stan (about 45 mn). Lilhjiholmen is a safe neighborhood and one could enjoy the lake/park/river behind the metro station (nice area deserving a tour). As if it was not already good enough, Jo is a very nice, warmhearted and friendly host. Should I go back to Stockholm one day, it will be at Jo's place without hesitation."
2084,442837,5093727,2013-06-11,6459888,Pedro,"I really enjoyed my stay at Jo's place. The apartment is modern, very clean and spacious. It is one bock from the metro that goes downtown. Very convenient. The only downside is that there is no Internet. There is a McDonald's a block away offering free wifi. "

2087,442837,5794004,2013-07-16,6907012,Nicholas,"My stay with Jo was fantastic. I was there for 5 nights and she made me feel incredibly welcome, it was like a home away from home. Lovely place, great room and the location is excellent, nice and close to the train line, which is only a short ride into central Stockholm. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending staying here!"
2088,442837,6973374,2013-09-01,5425203,Robert,"Jo was friendly and very resourceful asking her mother to help be at the apartment for my check in, etc.  The location is very convenient, literally a 2 min walk to the T station which is on the line that goes to all the key central stations.  The room is very small, the bed and a desk, but if you are okay with a tight and sparse space you will have what you need."
2089,442837,7227364,2013-09-11,7907970,Annabel,"My stay at Jo's place was absolutely great. Her appartment is lovely, spacious and full of light, I felt at home straight away and felt comfortable in the guest room. Her place is located very well within Stockholm and the next underground station is just round the corner. Jo was also a very welcoming host, really easy going and uncomplicated to communicate with. I would very much recommend her place and would book it again for another visit to Stockholm."
2090,442837,7385550,2013-09-17,2666785,Ryan,"Jo, was very welcoming and friendly. Her place is very close to the metro so getting in and out of town is easy."

2095,442837,8056345,2013-10-14,823714,Eva,Jo is the ideal host: very attentive to what you need as a guest and looking for the best solution for the two parties involved. I loved staying at her place. 
2096,442837,8806320,2013-11-18,9660299,J.B.,"Jo's place is great. It's a few steps away from Liljeholmen station, and only one stop from Södermalm (Hornstull) nd it's also very easy to get to Östermalm from there as well. The apartment was very clean and comfortable, and in a quiet area. I didn't get to meet Jo since she was travelling, but her mother met me and gave me the keys. She was very polite and helpful. I would recommend it to anyone going to Stockhölm."
2097,442837,13823982,2014-06-05,15235405,Maksym,"Our impressions after stay in Jo flat are good and meet or exceed expectation. 
Jo as well as her mother was kind and open for help. From 6 days we stay Jo spent only 2 nights and other time we was alone. Flat is located 150 meters from Underground station and 100 meters from the bus connection to Arlanda airport.  
The flat is quite big, light and good equipped. Guest room is not large but has all necessary thidgs.
"
2098,442837,13994644,2014-06-09,15587343,Karl,"Nice, clean, modern place. Jo's communication was great. Her mum was there to check me in and was kind and helpful. I met Jo later in my stay and she was kind as well. It was an easy 10 minute subway ride to/from central station and easy to get to other areas of Stockholm as well. Area is quiet and there is shopping available within the complex if you need food and such. All around a good comfortable stay."
2099,442837,14206189,2014-06-14,16326586,Sumit,"I had a great experience staying at Jo's place. It is right across the block from metro station and also the airport bus stop. There is a shopping mall and other shops also in the same block. The apartment is very spacious and has all the amenities you would require during your stay. The bedroom is small, but you get to use the great living room and kitchen area so the size of bedroom is not an issue at all. Jo was nice to arranged with her mother to give keys to me on my arrival day since she had to be away for work. Both her mother and Joanna are very helpful and nice and were eager to give any information regarding the city and my stay here.
Highly recommended!"
2100,442837,18031202,2014-08-20,12161477,Erin & Dan,"Jo was a super great host!  Her location is just right outside of Stockholm, but getting there is super easy.  The room was clean and it was a really safe area.  There are all sorts of transportation options, including trains and buses just right outside her doorstep.  There is also a great bike program where you can rent a bike for 3 days and it is supper easy to bike all over Stockholm.  Jo was super friendly, she provided an awesome map of the city and had great ideas and suggestions on how you should spend your time there.  Her condo is super secure and its really up to date.  "

The location is superb, next to subway, shopping mall, eateries, coffee shops and public bicycles. The lake, Trekentan, is just 5 minutes walk away. I would definitely consider using the apartment if i revisit Stockholm."
2102,442837,19041753,2014-09-05,8546565,Edward,"Joana's apartment was spacious, nicely illuminated, clean and comfortable. All the facilities are provided and the location is excellent. It is close to many shops and great transport connections too. Lots of places to eat and the shopping centre on your doorstep. No wireless in the flat - but you can get this at the McDonalds nearby.

Joana was accommodating and a flexible host. I was made to feel like I could come and go as I pleased and I think this was fine.
The room was good - had a good wardrobe, desk and comfortable bed. As much as I wanted. Kitchen was very  nice."
2103,442837,19573504,2014-09-14,15027193,Thomas,Great spot. Jo's mom met me and let me in and Jo is a lovely host. Very comfortable room in a lovely neighbourhood and its super easy to hop on the metro and check out Stockholm from Jo's place. Highly recommend.

2105,442837,22140298,2014-10-31,2067241,Tara,"I had a really lovely time staying at Jo's apartment. Her place is very easily accessible from the airport via a coach. The train station and busses are just downstairs, along with a big mall with food shops etc. It was very convenient to travel to the city for sightseeing on the metro. Jo was really kind and lovely to chat to. I had such a nice time in Stockholm and I definitely recommend this room for any travelers to the city!"
2106,442837,24628232,2014-12-31,23158535,Payton,"Although I didn't actually meet Jo, her mother was more than accommodating and checked me in with loads of tips and suggestions for exploring stockholm. I really felt at home here and had everything I needed for my short stay in Stockholm, but I imagine this would be a great place to stay longer as well. The location couldn't be more convenient coming from the train station and even getting to the airport. I had a great time and would recommend this space to anyone. "
2107,442837,31555958,2015-05-06,30379707,Mathew,"Jo was a great host, her place was clean and very nice. Walking distance to the old town as well. Can deff recommand. "

Vicinissimo a ristoranti caffè e supermercati e sopratutto alla metropolitana da cui si può arrivare ovunque.

2112,442837,46938688,2015-09-14,24898426,Lassi,"Jo was very welcoming and helpful, and everything went smoothly. Description of the apartment is accurate, and e.g. the washing machine was useful. The location is very pleasant and convenient for travel, given the immediate proximity of e.g. the subway and flygbussen. "

Das Zimmer ist hell und freundlich mit einem bequemen Bett. Jo ist sehr nett und hilfsbereit! Die Kommunikation über Buchung, Ankunftszeit, Check-in usw. verlief schnell und unkompliziert. Ich habe mich wirklich wohl gefühlt. Klare Empfehlung!"

2115,442837,75502454,2016-05-21,63374723,Jiri,"Přijetí bylo velmi vřelé a cítil jsem víceméně přátelskou atmosféru. Popis víceméně odpovídá realitě, byt je slunný, čistý, pokojík je sice malý a plně dostačuje (Wi-Fi, stůl a židle s pracovním stolem). Hostitelka velmi ochotně poradí s veškerými dalšími dotazy. V okolí je vynikající občanská vybavenost a pěkný park s jezerem na běhání. Ideální je také jak doprava z letiště (jedním autobusem až před dům), tak do centra (několik zastávek metra) ."
2116,442837,76349768,2016-05-26,62063504,Mary,"El dia de llegada me recibio la Sra Lidia, mama de Jo, excelente recibimiento y me dio todas las indicaciones del apartamento y de la zona, me mostro amablemente el mapa y todo lo importante para ver en Estocolmo. Gracias Lidia !! Luego llego Jo de su viaje, nos conocimos, una persona tranquila y silenciosa...

La habitacion y el piso es como salen en la foto, piso muy comodo, habitacion normal para una persona, yo estuve bien.
Zona muy tranquila y de facil acceso al metro para llegar a todos lados. Todo estuvo bien !!!  Gracias Jo y Lidia !! "
2117,442837,77027367,2016-05-30,1141482,Natt,"I stayed three nights at Jo's. It was almost midnight on the first night when I arrived in Liljeholmen. Her mom, Lidia, was kind enough to meet me the station as Jo was at a work event. After we got to the flat, she sat me down and gave me many useful tips about Stockholm. The bedroom is compact but comfortable. Although this was a flat sharing, Jo was out most of the time. However, she was very responsive via messages. There are shops in the mall next to the building which makes it convenient to get food/ drinks. I'd recommend a stay at Jo's if you're looking for an affordable flat share near a metro station that's not too far from Stockholm city centre."
2118,442837,77680894,2016-06-02,21530984,Katherine,"Jo was courteous and very responsive to my questions, and the apartment itself can't be beat in terms of access to public transportation. I didn't realize how important this would be until I arrived in Stockholm, and wow, I feel like I lucked out. The apartment is around the corner from a Metro stop, plus there is a very affordable direct bus to Arlanda airport also right around the corner. This was a good place to come back to after long days of sight seeing."
2119,442837,78625878,2016-06-07,39493449,Florian,"Jo's apartment was an excellent option for me. The apartment itself is well kept, light and in a quiet area. Metro and bus lines are just outside the building. This made it very convenient to travel from/to the airport and to the city center. Jo's mother provided me with lots of suggestions and city secrets, witch made it easier for me to get around.
Had a good time at Jo's place and would recommend it!"
2120,442837,84065818,2016-07-05,3203775,Ammar,"Great Location, 
Room is too small, but it could fine if just for sleeping.
Jo has been great!"
2121,442837,87056475,2016-07-18,37422330,Sonja,"I had a great stay in Stockholm. The room was small, but clean and exactly as described. I had everything I needed (desk, good Internet connection and a central location). The Tunnelbana stop Liljeholmen (underground metro) was literally across the street and there was also a Lidl store and a big shopping centre just around the corner. I didn't meet Jo as she was travelling herself. However, we were in touch via (Hidden by Airbnb) and on the phone and she made sure that a friend of hers checked me in, which all worked out fine. I also met her mum, who dropped by to see if everything was ok. The flat was very quiet day and night, so perfect after a busy day of sightseeing or attending a conference in the city. "
2122,442837,96034529,2016-08-21,4442693,Laurence,"Jo's apartment was perfect! Very easy to find and Jo met me in Leljeholmen square to walk to the flat (2 minutes). Communication was great and the room is fine and very comfortable.
The location is amazing and couldn't be closer to the metro line with the main city only a few stops away. Liljeholmen itself is very cool with a big mall that the apartment is attached to which is great for shopping. 
I'd highly recommend staying with Jo, she's really friendly and was able to help with questions I had about Stockholm and the local area."
2123,442837,100414218,2016-09-09,49695130,Tommy,Great place to stay!! Close to the city yet plenty of  parks around as well. Jo was very responsive in getting back with me and worked with me to make my checkin/checkout times work.
2124,442837,101429600,2016-09-13,90885123,Johan,"Was voor mij de eerste keer dat ik gebruik maakte van airbnb en ben zeker niet teleurgesteld. De kamer was in een mooi appartement in een modern gebouw. De verhuurde slaapkamer was niet groot, maar voorzien van ruim en goed bed. Ik voelde me welkom in het appartement van Jo, ook 2 vrienden die even op mij moesten wachten werden hartelijk binnen verwelkomt. De locatie is super, metrostation echt heel dichtbij. Het is een rustige buurt, maar met shoppin (Hidden by Airbnb) en supermarkt om de hoek. 
Communicatie met Jo verliep heel goed, ze stuurde berichten met tips voor de reis en zorgde dat het inchecken soepel verliep."
2125,442837,101792035,2016-09-15,29617685,Alf,"Jo was a fabulous host, very welcoming and was very quick & easy to communicate with. 
Great space and very accurate to the description provided. The location was very  quiet, yet only 2 min to the t-bana with 5-10 min into the centre of Stockholm.
I would highly recommend Jo as a host for a stay in Stockholm."

My experience was so good, Jo's mom met me and explain me all about her home, the neighbourhood and Stockholm. I met Jo one time, she was very discreet and respectful. I really recommend the place. thank you Jo."

Jo communicated very well regarding the check-in times. Although I didn't see her too often during my week-long stay, she was very friendly, and provided some tips on restaurants and sights in the area, such the outdoor ice rink in the city (at which I spent several hours one evening)."

2133,442837,167874600,2017-07-08,77146187,Tuan,Jo is awesome and very accommodating. Her location is right next to the subway (10 minute ride to the Central Station in Stockholm) that I frequently used to get everywhere I needed to go. Her place is also a short walk from the beautiful lake and shops (Liljeholmstorget).

Apartment itself is nicely decorated, spacious, and located close to the city center. I take the subway to Stockholm University every day and it was fast and easy. The station is only 2min away by walking. The neighborhood itself is quiet and the apartment is right next to a big mall with lots of places to eat and supermarkets. I had a great experience, and will recommend!"

Jo! How was the marathon!!? :)"
2138,442837,195467051,2017-09-19,145551775,Najati,"Good location, 1 minute away from major station and couple of stops from central station by metro. The host is nice and the place is clean. No complaints"

2141,442837,272119387,2018-06-03,10700142,Eamonn,"Jo was absolutely brilliant from the first contact to the last, she met me once I got off the bus and within 2 mins we were in her apt, which was beautiful, clean, bright and cosy, I couldn't ask for anything better. The location was brilliant, it was beside the bus stop, metro and tram and also there's a shopping centre beside you along with different places to eat and drink. I was running in the Stockholm marathon so getting to the expo and starting area only took me 16 mins by Meto. I can't say enough good things about Jo and her accommodation, she is a brilliant host. I totally recommend her place. I hope in the future to return there and enjoy all that Stockholm has to offer."
2142,442837,277848348,2018-06-17,33363001,Alexander,"I came to Stockholm for a professional meeting and found Joanna’s flat a perfect place to stay as it was conveniently located for public transportation both to the meeting at the Stockholmsmassan and also the town center (about 20 min to each).  She’s a fine host and was friendly, flexible with check in, and gave great tips on exploring the town.  Apartment is clean and quiet and communication was excellent."
2143,442837,284904706,2018-07-02,73387243,Amay,"Very comfortable apartment. Room was a bit on the smaller side, but it was very quiet and the curtains blocked out a lot of light. Has a desk and closet area and bed was comfortable! The bathroom is very clean and the washer was a necessity that was great and easy to use as well! Jo provided me with a map and some local tips on where to see the sunset over Stockholm and other things to do. The apartment is 1 minute away from the closest metro and a 3 min walk to the airport bus station. She was also generous enough to wait up for me after a flight delay and was a very courteous and pleasant host."
2144,442837,292547027,2018-07-18,193892622,Sapana,"It is a nice private room, with shared bathroom and kitchen. The location of the apartment is convenient. Jo gave advise on places to see around Stockholm and that was really helpful. "

2148,442837,457038234,2019-05-23,129034210,Vander,"I stayed at Jo’s for two nights. She was a great hostess. The bedroom was nice and I would definitely stay there again. Jo was quick in responding to my questions. The area was quiet at night which helps with a good sleep.  It was also very convenient (2min walk to the subway and close to restaurants, coffee shops, and a lake nearby). The room had a desk on which I could do some work on my laptop. Check-in and out went smoothly."
2149,442837,465659774,2019-06-08,262149552,Peter,"Joe is warmhearted and willing to help you.   I got some very helpful and useful information related to shopping and activities.  The apartment is very new, spacious and clean, with 100 meters from the Metro exit."

I got quick responses to all my questions related to the location while I was choosing a place to stay. This helped me to make a quick decision without losing much time.

Check-in went very well. Jo's mother met me and helped me understand the home and the locality and gave me valuable practical information for my stay.

Overall, all my needs were amply met."
2151,442837,478817449,2019-06-30,42770635,Michelle & Nicolas,"Jo's place was a very comfortable stay for an extended weekend in Stockholm. It is literally only a few steps from the metro station, and very easy access to places e.g. Sodermalm and Gamla Stan. The room itself was clean and bright, and Jo was very helpful in helping me find the place when I arrived. She also offered great tips on things I was interested in, including great running paths and events going on that weekend. I would highly recommend staying with her!"
2152,442837,502815541,2019-08-05,77243431,Jenny,Check in was really smooth and Jo's mother was superb in offering lots of tips for places to go and getting around. The apartment is right next to the trains & buses for quick access to the city and a large shopping centre. Jo's apartment is spacious and has everything I needed for a lovely stay. Thanks Jo

Her apartment very cosy, clean and beautiful located near the main station so all places are near from you 
Totally recommended for any visit to Stockholm for work or vacation."
2154,442837,517275864,2019-08-25,255198494,Esther,"Jo is a quite and open-minded person. Her flat is really closed to the metro, the mall and the lake. It was my first experience of Airbnb and I really enjoyed it ! I recommend her !"

2160,448259,3256403,2013-01-03,4441839,Chris,"Ali has turned his home into a small hostel. The house is lovely and clean, there is a separate bathroom/toilet for the guests and Ali is very welcoming, helpful and answers queries quickly.

The only issue is it isn't so convenient to the centre of Stockholm. It is easy to get there but the journey takes some time. It would be better suited to a long term stay.

But other than that. Strongly recommended. "
2161,448259,3599543,2013-02-22,4395470,Ida,"It was a really pleasant stay at Ali's and with his family. He is an open-minded man with a big heart and you fell welcome in his house, he is always there for you.
I would absolutely recomend to stay at Ali. "
2162,448259,9181377,2013-12-11,9778483,Thibaud,I've stayed 1 month in this room. It was very nice and very clean. A bit far away from the city center but it's ok.

2164,448259,21195305,2014-10-13,17021803,Aki,"Ali is very kind and warm person. He always did his best to make me feel at home.  The kitchen is well equipped and has enough storage space. This room has a tv and a desk. We share a bathroom on the basement floor with around five people. Location is not far from the subway station, but during night time you may pay attention. You can wash your clothes once a week, and must clean your room precisely before check out. I enjoyed my stay, and like Ali's apples so much! Many thanks again!"
2165,448259,433313292,2019-04-06,134057792,大浅,"I stayed Ali's place for about 4 months. This place is very close to Rinkeby centrum, and super easy access to Stockholm central city (about 20 min by subway). I mostly recommend persons who have business in Stockholm University or Karolinska Institutet, because there is bus stop for directing Stockholm University and Hallonbergen, then exchanging bus to Karolinska Institutet. Ali is a nice host with high hospitality, and provide comfortable time with clean space during your stay here. In particular, other accommodation costs very high in Stockholm. Ali's place is cost reasonable, but comfortable and clean as I mentioned above. I say again, I recommend strongly to stay here during your trip."
2166,448259,468764959,2019-06-13,248889152,Gaëlle,"Un bon accueil. Mais trop de restrictions. Ok pas d'alcool, ok pas d'animaux etc. Seulement? certains aliments ne sont pas acceptés et ce n'est pas précisé dans l'annonce. Les fenêtres n'ont pas le droit d'être ouvertes alors que je payais quand même une chambre (et le reste)  600 euros, je pense qu'on a quand même le droit d'ouvrir la fenêtre! Et personne ne dit pourquoi. Le ménage doit être fait par la personne qui réserve même si elle paie des frais de ménage. Je pense que quand on accueil quelqu'un et que la personne paie des frais pour le ménage on DOIT s'arranger pour que ça soit nettoyé. Pour ma part j'ai quitté le logement à cause de ça.  Il fallait nettoyé plusieurs fois par semaine car des plaintes avaient été déposées par une personne à l'hôte Ali, alors que cette personne n'utilisait pas la pièce en question (et que, sans exagérer, la pièce n'était absolument pas sale.)  Donc gros problème de communication. Je n'y reviendrai pas et je pense que l'hôte sera en accord avec mon choix. :)"

2171,451155,6453671,2013-08-13,4629103,Dirk,Malin's house is very nice and comfortable in a beautiful and quiet neigbourhood. Great for a family with little children. Downtown Stockholm is quickly reached via the nearby metro station where you also can find a supermarket. Recommended!
2172,451155,12558121,2014-05-05,13437179,Florence,"Very good experience. The house is very nice: well equiped, spacious and quiet. The neighborhood is also very pleasant: very green and quiet.

The house is very well located: there is a bus down the street that drops you off at the metro station. You are in down town is 20 min! 
Also, you have a supermarket 15 min walk. I recommend +++ this place. Thank you Malin for everything! "
2174,451155,16388740,2014-07-27,11043830,Patrick,We enjoyed the holiday in Malins House very much. The house is so beautiful and well furnished. It’s perfect for a family holiday in Stockholm: The “Tunellbana” is easy to reach and there is also a supermarket. Highly recommended!
2175,451155,19644528,2014-09-15,20641630,Xianran,Malin is so nice!!!! I really love Malin's house. It's very spacious and clean. Thank you!! I will definitely recommend this house to everyone
2176,451155,27654447,2015-03-09,7922758,Hagay,"Malin house is great, it has everything i wished for"
2177,451155,28933458,2015-04-01,25880989,Hang,"Malin was very welcoming as my first airbnb experience she made me feel very comfortable. Her house was very nice, very spacious and accommodating. We had a 1 year old with us who had no problems settling into the house. All the essentials was provided for. We had movie nights in when it was rainy with a good selection of movies. I would recommend Malin's home, lovely, clean, spacious and in a very convenient location."
2178,451155,33738369,2015-05-31,2891210,Sabine,"We stayed at Malin's house for 5 days and really enjoyed our time there. We did not spend that much time at her house as we loved spending time in Stockholm. The house is in a quiet neighbourhood, but is very well connected to Stockholm by public transportation. We walked to the bus station which is right down the street and took the bus to the metro station (Svedmyra). Alternatively, we could have walked to the metro station. 
We did not meet Marlin in person as she was away on a business trip, but she let us stay at her house at very short notice. She was very friendly in the email and phone communication and we are sure that it would have been a pleasure to meet her in person. The communication with her was very easy. 
The house is wonderful. It is exactly like described by Malin and shown in the pictures. We only used the kitchen for making breakfast as we ate at different restaurants in Stockholm. We stayed the bedroom with a double bed. It is a large king-size bed and extremely comfortable. As it is so quiet in the neighbourhood, we slept very well. 
We can really recommend this place a lot! "
2179,451155,37279850,2015-07-06,6097995,Roderic,"It was nice to meet Malin at the house as arranged. She was very friendly and we enjoyed staying in her house. The house is located in a very green suburb - it's almost like being in a forest and we saw a deer and fawn from the kitchen window one morning. However, it is also very convenient within 10 mins walk of the metro and a great supermarket. 
The weather in Stockholm was hot so it was ideal to return from the city centre to relax in the bright, spacious house and garden. All in all, a very comfortable, well-equipped house to stay in."
2180,451155,37704308,2015-07-09,9764796,Aimin,"Malin's house is very spacious, clean and well equipped. The location is convenient, in walking distance to grocery shop and metro station. Malin is a responsible host and very clear in giving instructions on the phone. We had a comfortable stay and felt home in Stockholm. I would recommend her house to others, especially to family travelers."
2181,451155,47631998,2015-09-21,34599380,Zara,"Great experience in Malins house. Very spacious, clean, well equipped, with a supermarket close by and great connections to central Stockholm. In a very quiet suburb which was great for relaxing. Malin was great at helping us with anything we needed. Really enjoyed our stay. "
2182,451155,71455304,2016-04-25,48595162,Arttu,I really enjoyed to be at Malins beatiful house at Stockholm. There was no problems. I saw wild deers on the yard. Wildlife in the middle of city!
2183,451155,116765029,2016-12-03,31175685,Terry,"My whole family stayed in Malin's place for 3 nights. My parents like this place so much especially the well equipped kitchen and large space living room. This is the first time we went to Stockholm. The location of the house is exactly the same as description. I would say driving is much more convenient than taking public transportation.

2184,451155,142668393,2017-04-09,44277989,Jan,"Mooi en gezellig huis in een rustige buitenwijk van Stockholm, ten zuiden van het centrum. Een kwartiertje stappen naar het dichtsbijzijnde metrostation Smedvyra. Of 5' stappen en dan bus 163 naar de metro :)
Mooie groene omgeving, we zagen 's ochtends zelfs jonge rendieren in de tuin. Handig ook dat de keuken volledig voorzien is, zodat je niet voor kruiden of wat zout naar de supermarkt moet. Kortom, een aanrader voor wie Stockholm wil ontdekken tijdens een citytrip."
2185,451155,151888918,2017-05-14,102678784,Olivier,"We stayed at Malin's house for a long week-end in family, and we really don't regret it!

The house is conform to the descritpion, and really cosy. We felt home really quickly. Malin was a really nice guest who is easily reachable and answer all important questions before the arrival.

We highly recommend it!"

2187,451155,301363812,2018-08-04,8945856,Lüke,"This is a beautiful, spacious, and comfortable home with a lot of natural light. Easy access to bus and train to get around. A great place for families or couples to stay, and great value for what we paid. Definitely a 5-Star stay.

We loved nearly every aspect of staying here, except for one minor thing that was unexpected and uncontrollable. We came to visit Stockholm during an outrageous heatwave in the summer, and in order to cool the house down we had to open windows that didn’t have nets or screens, and as a result had to constantly chase bees and wasps out that would fly in. But in any other season, this would not have been a problem we think."
2188,451155,365471847,2019-01-01,20793452,Lila,the house is lovely and big. Perfect for a Family or a group of friends.
2189,451155,367625702,2019-01-05,220996227,Marina,Malins hus var super fint med toppenläge. Vi hade det så skönt. Utöver det så var Malin en utmärkt värd som snabbt svarade på alla frågor och var väldigt tillmötesgående. Perfekt boende för en familj.
2190,453692,1243543,2012-05-07,1542626,Marion,"We spent 4 nights in Lovisa's apartment which was ideal for our 'city break' in Stockholm. Contact with Lovisa was very easy. We needed to make a last minute booking as our original accommodation was cancelled and she replied immediately. She was very flexible about check in/check out as our flight arrived early but left late.
Lovisa's apartment really is light and has a nice view of the Tantolunden park. It's a few minutes from the T-bana and buses stop outside the door. There are nice walks around the shore in both directions with great views, especially to the north, and it was easy to reach Gamla Stan or foot either along the water or via Hornsgatan. 
There are shops for all basic needs and a state run alcohol outlet in the immediate vicinity. The kitchen is adequately equipped for the preparation of simple meals.
Our concerns about traffic noise were unfounded due to the sound insulation of triple glazing.  It may prove more of a problem in summer as this is a very cosy flat. Being old enough to be Lovisa's parents we were also concerned about noise from the bar when, on our first night, there was live music with the drum kit directly beneath the kitchen!  However, it stopped at around 10.30 and we were not disturbed any other night, including Friday & Saturday. In fact we slept well in a very comfortable bed.
Sodermalm is a great district to stay for a visit to Stockholm and Lovisa's apartment makes a good base which we can recommend."
2191,453692,1375248,2012-05-29,2306286,Bhavna,Very nice and comfortable stay at this apartment. Lovisa was prompt in replying to our questions. Simple kitchen for cooking basic stuff. Overall very good location and excellent place to stay. Great location because the subway was very close. We stayed at Lovisa's place for 3 days and it was very cozy. I would recommend this place.
2192,453692,1449935,2012-06-10,2329864,Mark,"Good location for exploring Stockholm. 25 min walk to Gamla Stan, 1 min to the metro. Lovisa was very accomodating and I would recommend staying at her apartment if visiting Stockholm"

2200,453692,4533133,2013-05-11,3868165,Marie,"The apartement is very well located, in Sodermalm, just two minutes from the ""hornstull"" subway station with shops, bars, parks in the near surroundings. We were first afraid of traffic noise but it turned out to be very quiet because of the triple glazing. From our point of view, maybe the apartement was not as clean as we expected.
Lovisa is very welcoming, super communicative and helpful, very flexible with check in and check out. It was a super stay in Stockholm ; thanks Lovisa ! :)"

The area is really nice and has become one of my favourite spots in the city.

We would def. recommend Lovisa's apartment to others."

She was very kind letting me know all the good things/places of the city and close to the apartment.

The only thing is that I went thinking she had internet/Wifi and that was not the case. I could connect to an open wifi over there, but very badly. I would reccomend double check this things with the hosts.

I would come back again (with internet) by sure.

Thanks Coretta :)"

Everything was clean and good working. 
The appartment is in a very nice neighbourhood with a lot of restaurants and shops and is only about 8 minutes walk from the metrostation which will take you to the heart of Stockholm or other neighbourhoods.

Its located in Södermalm, a safe and nice area. The stop for the citybus was just around the corner, the subway is only a 10 minutes walk away and there are good resturants, grocery stores and 7/11´s all over the place.

The apartment was clean and had all we needed for a good stay; warm shower, fridge and stove for cooking dinner and a nice livingroom if you just want to relax in the afteroon.

The host, Coretta, made sure me and my girlfriend found the place and met us when we arrived to the apartment and showed us the flat. She was a very good and professional host.

Ascenseur en panne au moment de la visite, mais aucun pb, on est jeunes et mobiles ! Coretta très réactive et soucieuse du bien-être de ses visiteurs.
Le Super plus : la vie de quartier : beaucoup d'animation, des restos vraiment très sympas tout autour.
Le moins : le lit (s'explique sans doute en grande partie par les standards suédois : 1.20) 
Adresse à retenir !"

It had everything we needed. Sodermalm is a great area to stay in, easily accesible and very relaxed. We appreciated the host's flexibility with check out. We also learned the Swedes aparently don't use electric kettles as much as we do :)  I highly recommend staying at Cor's for a short stay in Stockholm."

Because it is located in old town we have to take some stairs up to find the location in the street and after enter the door on the first floor, there are still stairs before finding the  room. It will be a bit hard if taking heavy luggages. But it is great that Correta helps a lot for taking good care of us, including guidance for city visit and shopping. Very good company to stay with:)"

However, the sleeping arrangement she provided was not the one I booked: I was given the choice of a top bunk bed (bottom was a desk) or a pull out sofa bed. It's one of the most inexpensive rentals you can find in Stockholm, and if she updated the sleeping arrangement I'd re-book in a heartbeat. "

2256,475409,142724308,2017-04-09,112683571,Richard,Great host really nice time in the city
2257,475409,150596639,2017-05-08,1111366,Dominika,"I loved staying at Cor´s.

First of all, she is super nice and very friendly, helpful and she was amazing with me coming super late at night because my plane was delayed. 
Her flat is cozy and the room I stayed in is big enough and has its own balcony!

The flat is situated right in the middle of the hipster part of Stockholm, walking distance to city center (15 minutes) and all the bars and nice restaurants.

We had a couple of nice chats with Cor and if there was more time, we would definitely talk much longer! 

Highly recommended!"
2258,475409,154873416,2017-05-26,7648754,Susan,"Wonderful stay. Cor is a generous, warm host. Great room and splendid location. I would love to visit Stockholm again someday - and would contact Cor if I am able to go!"
2259,475409,157576954,2017-06-04,9857075,Rogelio,"Cor, la anfitriona, es muy atenta, amable y simpática. Intenta que en todo momento estés a gusto y cómodo. La entrega de llaves fue muy fácil y las indicaciones de Cor para llegar a su casa muy precisas.
El apartamento es pequeño pero muy bien situado, cerca de muchos restaurantes y bares, se puede ir andando a todos los sitios turísticos de Estocolmo.
El alojamiento no es el que aparece en las fotografías ya que Cor se cambió de domicilio lo comunicó a Airbnb hace meses y estos no han cambiado la información en la plataforma. 
La cama es tipo litera, con solo una cama en parte de arriba, abajo es mesa y silla para aprovechar el espacio. Cuando Cor ancle el mueble a la pared será más cómodo. 
La relación calidad precio para lo que es Estocolmo es buena.
Gracias Cor por todo.

She showed me where to get certain foods I was looking for. The place is close to public transportation, though I chose to walk, so that's very feasible. If I go back, I hope I can meet her again!"

2262,478105,4573979,2013-05-13,5179147,Viviane,"Amazing doesn't even start to describe the place. Christian went to pick us up on one of the subway stations closest to the place, which is less than 10 minutes by foot, both of them. It has everything you might need and more, like a massage chair, two Macs with internet available and and insanely awesome amplifier with speakers. Dream home. Only being there to know and see everything in it. All the house instructions are in a paper for further reference, and if have any doubts, just ask the host, he'll promptly answer your question.
It has two supermarkets that are very close, and if you're not willing to go far at night, there's a great restaurant/bar nearby. But you can also get to the city center very fast any time of the day. If you're not sure where to go, just ask Christian, he knows a lot of places to indicate and was happy to do so. You won't regret staying in this place. Me and my friends are 100% sure it was a better option than staying at a hostel."
2263,478105,4690042,2013-05-20,6264892,Kaisa,"Christian´s place was really as good as it is described. Definitely worth to stay there than in a hostel. Me and my friends enjoyed the whole experience.

"
2264,478105,4822889,2013-05-27,6519442,Tom,"Christian's apartment is great. Bright, spacious, modern, pretty, and in a nice neighbourhood, with some cool bars and restaurants. Touristy Stockholm isn't within walking distance, but is no distance at all by metro, and the metro station's very close. Two of them are very close, actually - one of them, a 4 to 5 minute walk through some really pretty forest. The sun was shining when I was there, and I loved that little walk.

Above all though, if you stay here, you get the benefit of Christian, who is a phonecall away, an awesome guy, and knows absolutely everyone and everything there is to know about Stockholm.

I've been to Stockholm a few times, but never have I had as much fun as this time, and that's purely because of his knowledge and advice on where to go and what to do (if you want it) - and in a place where fashions change as fast as Stockholm, that's worth knowing. 

Really would recommend it...

Cheers,

Tom

The area is safe, quiet and very clean. The home is very artistic and interesting. We enjoyed our stay."

El primer día llegábamos muy tarde, y todo fueron facilidades por parte de Christian. Nos aprovechamos de muchas de las recomendaciones que tenía publicadas en el anuncio, y no nos defraudó. No puedo decir nada negativo del apartamento."

The apartment is spacious and clean. Public transport is a nice walk trough the park. The shower is nice and clean. The bed is really good and big (1.80x2.00). Wifi works fine and the computers in the apartment are a nice addition for looking up information. The massage chair is a blessing after a day of discovering the city.

We recommend:
- the food view and expo's at fotografisk,
- The burgers at vigårda,
- All the food at the Hötorgshallen,
- Gamla Stan, Pizza Hatt, and in Gamla Stan is an overprized café, schweizer konditori, where you should try the sandwichpie or smörgåstårtoar."
2269,478105,33762371,2015-06-01,22118957,Wolfgang,"Herr Wigardt war bei der Wohnungsübernahme kurz anwesend und hat div. Empfehlungen abgegeben und sich bereit erklärt für weitere Anfragen telefonisch zur Verfügung zu stehen.

Die Wohnung liegt in einem ruhigen Vorort von Stockholm. Die Blicke aus den Fenstern gehen ins Grüne, was sehr angenem ist.

Die Wohnung war bei der Übernahme sehr verschmutzt (am Boden war Lurch, Betten, insbesondere Matratzen, dicke Staubschicht auf den Möbeln und Sesseln, Geschirr etc.). Ein Raum konnte wegen der extremen Verschmutzung der Betten nicht benützt werden, daher wurden Matratzenauflagen verwendet um ein ""Bett"" am Boden des Wohnzimmers zu schaffen. Man hatte subjektiv den Eindruck die Bettwäsche eines Bettes wurde nach dem Vorbenützer nicht gewechselt. Wir hatten vorher noch nie eine derart verschmutzt Unterkunft erlebt. Bei der Anwesenheit von Herrn Wigardt gleich beim Einzug war das Ausmaß der Verunreinigung noch nicht abzusehen, wir waren sozusagen überrumpelt.

Die Balkone waren unverwendbar (verschmutzte Liegestühle).

Das Free-WIFi hat nicht funktioniert."

Christian fue un excelente anfitrión, estuvo pendiente de todo y nos recomendó muchos lugares para conocer y comer. El barrio es muy lindo y tranquilo. 
Sin duda, si volviéramos a Estocolmo nos alojaríamos nuevamente allí. "

There is a convenient supermarket at each of the 2 subway stations near the apartment.
After a long day of exploring we especially enjoyed the massage chair and the Tempur mattresses! I don't know how I've survived 2 weeks vacation without these before ;)
We didn't meet with Christian in person, but the email & text contact was very nice and considerate.
All in all we had a great stay and can warmly recommend this appartment!"

He cared about all the nuances of our arrival in the new year: he has prepared a list of Christmas events, how to get the best views of the fireworks, etc. He did not leave any question unanswered and was very responsive.

Apartments
Excellent apartments in 10 minutes from the metro station örnsberg. The apartment has everything necessary for four tourists - two shower rooms, a spacious living room with a massage chair (now I want to buy a home the same)), kitchen, dining room, two bedrooms. All rooms are clean with creative atmosphere.

Area
Excellent quiet area near the small forest. Going out in the evening to smoke, you can meet deer, hares, or a neighbor's cat. There is a good supermarket where we buy food near örnsberg station.

It’s a perfect choice for large company"
2275,478105,74734230,2016-05-16,1598846,Alex,"We had a fabulous stay at Christian's beautiful flat. It was well located between two metro stops, and only takes a few minutes to get to Gamla Stan (or other central areas). Christian is a lovely guy, always available to contact for any questions. The flat itself is clean, quirky, large, and in a pretty area of Stockholm. 

I would highly recommend it. "

La casa ha molto carattere, è particolare, piena di oggetti e mobili relativi ai suoi viaggi e la sua vita. Pulita. Spaziosa e ideale per 3/4 persone, avendo sue bagni.
Si trova a sud di Stoccolma, 5/10 min a piedi dalla metro e dal supermercato, in un contesto residenziale e tranquillo, nel verde.
L'appartamento è molto fornito di tutto (solo ricordatevi di portare un asciugacapelli!), Christian ci ha addirittura comprato un seggiolone Ikea per la nostra bimba.
È stata nel complesso una bella esperienza che mi sentirei di suggerire!"

Christian's place is charming and full of character. The apartment was very clean, the beds were comfortable, the kitchen was well-equipped for cooking (we cooked quite a few meals at home) and it's located in a fantastic location. There's 2 balconies and a picnic table outside. Honestly, we couldn't have picked a better place. We're so happy with our decision to stay at Christian's. 

Christian was fantastic with answering all of our questions, giving us tips and making sure we got to and from the airport safely. He is genuinely friendly, sweet, thoughtful and helpful and his place was perfect for our needs. We HIGHLY recommend."

2292,478105,351924566,2018-11-24,40113641,Adam,"This is a truly wonderful place for a long-term stay (mine was 3 months).  The apartment is private, in a quiet neighborhood, and a 5 minute walk from the Tunnelbana (subway), from where most of the city is easily accessible.  But the best part for me was the very entertaining and quirky -- in a good way! -- decor.  There was always something new to catch my attention, especially in those moments when a little distraction is needed.  And Christian is a fabulous host.  I never needed for much because the apartment is so well furnished, but Christian was always available on short notice if I had any questions or other needs.  I recommend you snap this place up if it's available (unless of course I'm trying to reserve it again, in which case, disregard my review!)."

Замечательная квартира в очень хорошем районе, описанию соответствует полностью.
Что немаловажно для путешествующих на автомобиле - есть бесплатная парковка, причем не на улице, а на многоэтажной парковке в ста метрах от дома (насколько это, конечно, применимо, а району с 3-4 этажной застройкой) парковке в ста метрах от дома, т.е. можно за автомобиль не переживать - по Стокгольму гораздо рациональней передвигаться на метро, до которого всего насколько минут пешком.
От общения с хозяином остались только самые лучшие впечатления, надеюсь, что наше знакомство продолжится и дальше.

He is a nice guy, happy and open with an huge and beautiful flat !  The room he rent is bigger than most hotel rooms, he cleared every closets (which are huge too) to store my stuff, and have a big luxury bed (very confortable and helpful for my back which was killing me). The flat is a duplex so i could have all the intimacy i wanted even if Ric was very kind - we talked a lot during this week, shared lunch or dinner which was nice and confortable. 
The district (Hammarby Sjostad) is also a superb place to stay, i was here for work but i can say it's a beautiful and confortable area. Ric's flat also have a terrasse in the room with water view on penthouse (unfortunately i wasn't able to use it cause of temporary construction, but i have seen the view which is very nice).

Finally, i can say ric is a formidable host with smart conversation, a beautiful flat in a very nice district and an open mind. He was like a friend with me and he let me all the intimacy i wanted when i needed it.

---

J'ai passé 10 jours à Stockholm pour le travail, et tout le voyage était parfait. En particulier rester dans Hammarby Sjostad chez Ric. 
Ric est un gars très sympa, heureux et ouvert avec un énorme et magnifique appartement ! La chambre qu'il loue est plus grande que la plupart des chambres d'hôtel. Elle dispose de beaucoup de placards (qu'il avait libéré pour que je puisse stocker mes affaires), et disposent d'un grand lit (très confortable et utile pour mon dos qui me tuait). L'appartement est en duplex ce qui m'a permit d'avoir toute l'intimité que je voulais, même si Ric était très gentil - nous avons beaucoup parlé au cours de cette semaine, et également partagé plusieurs repas ce qui a été très agréable. 
Le quartier (Hammarby Sjostad) est également un superbe endroit pour rester, j'étais ici pour travailler, mais je peux dire que c'est un quartier magnifique et très agréable. L'appartement de Ric a également une terrasse dans la chambre avec vue sur l'eau en penthouse (malheureusement je n'ai pas pu l'utiliser à cause d'une construction temporaire, mais j'ai quand même pu voir la vue qui est très agréable). 

Enfin, je peux dire ric est un hôte formidable, intelligent avec de la conversation, un bel appartement dans un quartier très agréable, et un esprit ouvert. Il était comme un ami avec moi et il m'a laissé toute l'intimité que je voulais quand j'en avais besoin."

Ric is just the perfect host, he is pleased to tell you everything about the extremely nice neighborhood and suggest you good restaurants nearby. During my stay I was living in the upper floor, with an own bathroom, a nice bedroom and a balcony from where you have a beautiful sight of the waterside. Furthermore I was able to make full use of the kitchen as well.
The apartment is located in the beautiful area of Hammarby Sjöstad, it's perfect for walks arround the waterside. And you have the tramstation right in front of the house and need approx. 20 minutes to get into the city center.
I can fully recommend staying with Ric!"

2307,514133,4864737,2013-05-29,6239997,Jack,"The apartment was great. As described and as pictured. First about the apartment: Light, big livingroom, great cooking area, well stocked kitchen, good food preparation space and comfortable table to eat at. Mira left the refrigerator largely empty so plenty of room for stocking food. Refrigerator, stove, microwave, dishwasher. Internet worked well. Big screen TV worked with a limited set of stations. Bed in the bedroom is either a single or twin. Comfortable but not a bed for a couple. Was told the sofa in the living room can convert to a space that sleeps two.

About location. I couldn't have been in a better place. In the immediate neighborhood (a few blocks) are a park, an ICA supermarket (on Dalagatan), many restaurants (which I didn't try). Close enough to downtown to walk to Central terminal/City Hall area (about 1.5 kilometers), Old City, Palace and Cathedral about 2 km, port area about 3 km (2 miles), Vasa Museum on Djurgarden about 4km (2.4 miles). I walked to all and the walk, through residential and retail areas is pleasant. Stockholm is a great walking city. For those who don't want to walk, the public transportation is also great. I took the Flygbussan from Arlanda to St. Eriksplan and had a 5 minute walk to the apartment. There are 2 T stops within a 10 minute walk, St. Eriksplan and Odenplan. I took the T and bus to Drottningsholm Palace from St. Eriksplan in about 30 minutes. The 53 and 69 buses are a block away. Both go downtown and the 69 goes along the harbor street Strandvagen. Also took the east-west bus along Odengaten to get to a meeting.

Finally, the host. She left the apartment in great shape, a long note on the where things were and how to use the washing machine/dryer, dishwasher and trash. Made easy arrangements for me to pick up the key and leave it when I left at 5am for the airport. This was the first time I used Airbnb and my experience with both the apartment and the host was great. Would book it again if I was headed to Stockholm.

Von Ankunft bis Abreise hat alles wie geplant funktioniert, die Gastgeberin war darüber hinaus sehr hilfsbereit und hat zu jederzeit auf Fragen geantwortet und gerne auch Tipps gegeben. In der Wohnzng selbst fühlt man sich sehr wohl. Die Lage ist optimal: sehr zentral und dennoch schön ruhig an einem Park gelegen. Die nächste Tunnelbana ist in nur 5 Min zu Fuß erreichbar. Sehr positiv war zudem die gute Wohnungsausstattung. "
2311,514133,343573513,2018-11-01,9753378,Maxim,"I spent more than 2 months in Mira's apart and It definitely was an excellent experience to stay here. It's bright, very well equipped and with good furniture. The area is perfect with many restaurants nearby, subway/train/buses around and 15 mins walking distance to the city center. And of course Mira is an excellent host, she was ready to help with everything I needed."

She was very helpful from the second we emailed her about asking to stay at her apartment and provided us with lots of information. She also went out of her way to help us with our arrival and departure and made us feel very comfortable during our time in Stockholm. Her apartment is the best we have stayed in, it's exactly as shown in the pictures and is clean,spacious and has a great location, with easy access to the centre of Stockholm. If we were to come back to Stockholm we would definitely return to Margareta's apartment and recommend her apartment to anyone coming to Stockholm!"
2314,514210,4704390,2013-05-21,3981007,Alice,"We had very nice stay with Magareta's family. They were really nice, friendly, helpful. They even came to pick us up at the central station. The flat is really clean, spacious with a really nice view, close to the bus station and have all the required accommodations around. Great value! We recommend!  "

We also loved the big kitchen for cooking and storing groceries :) Margareta was very helpful, picked us up from the Central station on our first day and also drove us to the Central station on our last day. She showed us everything about how to use the public transport system, how to find food restaurants and how to enjoy ourselves in Sköndal and Stockholm. She was always concerned to find the right answer to all our questions and to cater for our needs (we could use her bikes, we could wash our clothes, etc.). We recommend her place and her hospitality 100 percent."
2317,514210,6441964,2013-08-12,4451156,Ilya & Kasya,Margareta is hospitable and friendly host. We spent only a few days in Stockholm and managed to see a lot somewhat due to her help. The room was very nice(pictures are true) with separate commodities. My wife really liked the balcony.
2318,514210,6880329,2013-08-28,8081387,Andreas,"Margareta and her family was a nice and careing host and we had a great time in Stockholm. Visit her, we can recommend it."

2320,514210,7738964,2013-10-01,7016810,Vidya,"Hi,
I had the most amazing time at Margareta's. She is a fabulous host and helped me out with getting to know Stockholm a lot (even came to the city to pick me up on the day of my arrival). The room/balcony/kitchen etc. are exactly as shown in the pictures (or even better!). 
There is a supermarket (Hemsköp) right outside the apartment and also couple of pizzerias and eateries as well. There is also a bank (hence an ATM) nearby the supermarket.
The city can be reached in about 15-20 minutes and is very well connected by busses/metros. 
I highly recommend this place for all those wanting to enjoy the Stockholm city while based in a calm and quiet area.

Thank you Margareta and kids for the extremely wonderful time !!

Regards,
Vidya"
2321,514210,9365047,2013-12-24,9567894,Anna,"It was wonderful trip to Stockholm for me! Margareta and her fsmily make me feel myself at home! The rum is very comfortable. You have a lot of space for you thinks in the stor, table and a seperate bathroom with towels. The house is situated very comfortable. It takes only 3 minutes to get to the bus stop and to get to the t-centrolen only 20 minutes. 
Margareta helped me to buy ticket and get me very useful advice! She helps in everything! 
I was really happy to stay in there place!"

Margareta is a very nice woman, pleasant to deal with, and a wonderful housekeeper. The room is great, everything is so cozy and clean. Margareta has really cheerful and outgoing children. Everything was perfect, thank you very much for this wonderful time so I'm happy to make these highest recommendations! I hope I will have a chance to visit Stockholm again, and if so I will definitely stay at Margareta's house with a great pleasure."
2323,514210,14856654,2014-06-28,13625625,Penelope,"I had a great one month-stay at Margareta's place. 
The room is clean and cosy and very well furnished, it is possible to have breakfast on the belonging balcony ! Besides, the area is quite, safe and only 20 minutes from the city center ! There are very good connections (bus, metro) to get there!
And, last but not least, Margareta is a wonderful host! She just tries anything she can to help you and make you feel as good as at home!
I highly recommand this place and I would love to go back myself!"
2324,514210,18771697,2014-08-31,14311738,Luiz Gustavo,"I had a great stay at Margareta's lovely house: the room was super cosy, impeccably clean, the house is next to a supermarket and a bus stop going to the city center, and, most important of all, Margareta was the prefect host, welcoming, helpful and friendly. Fully recommended."
2325,514210,21120845,2014-10-12,16078373,Carolin,"We (three people) stayed for six weeks at Margareta's flat. She rent out two rooms and a bathroom and we shared kitchen with her family. She explained everything necessary and was always very friendly and polite. Her children were nice and considerate as well. The rooms were clean and cosy and the housing complex was quite nice. The flat is close to a supermarket, some restaurants and the busstop. 
The place in the fridge and also in the cupboard was a bit too small for
Three. But Margareta was always tried to let us in the kitchen when we want to cook something. 
We had a good time at Margareta's place and wish all the best to her and the childs. Thanks a lot! 
"
2326,514210,27989706,2015-03-16,3707788,Raul,Margareta is a very cultivated woman with two beautiful and very polite children. Also she is a great host and made my first two months in Stockholm really easy. She helped me settling and gave all sorts of advice about the city. I am very grateful. The neighbourhood is enclaved in a beautiful little forest and is super safe and quiet. The view from the room is pretty to the forest. The bathroom is private and everything is always tidy and super clean.  Also the bus stop is very close by and connects in no time to the city. Highly recommended for couples and tourists!
2327,514210,32160277,2015-05-15,26892776,Christian,"My stay in Stockholm was fantastic. Margareta made me feel most welcome in her home and was extremely helpful with everything. The room was lovely and spacious with en-suite bathroom and balcony. As the description says, there is a beautiful view out to the forest. Sköndal is a suburb of Stockholm with a shopping centre two minutes walk from the apartment that has a supermarket, bank, chemist, newsagent and restaurant. The bus stop is about 7 minutes walk and buses run into Stockholm every two or three minutes. It takes ten minutes bus ride to get to Gullmarsplan metro station and then from there the metro goes all over Stockholm. From the flat to the very centre of Gamla Stan takes half an hour at the most. The apartment is in a very quiet area of Stockholm and it was nice to return to a peaceful area after a busy day in the city. A twenty minute bus ride to the south brings you to Tyresta National Park, where it is possible to go for long hikes amongst the ancient forest and lakes. "
2328,514210,32883244,2015-05-23,78044,Charles,"Margareta was a great hostess.  Her home was beautiful, clean, and convenient.  She was very helpful in providing information about Stockholm."
2329,514210,33502854,2015-05-29,29722811,Sebastian,I stayed with my wife and my 6 months old child at Margaretas place for 5 days. All three of us really felt at home there because Margareta and her children made us feel very comfortable. Moreover Margareta is a great host.  Whenever we had questions Margareta helped us out. The room itself is very clean and nice to stay at. A few minutes walking from the house you have the centre of Sköndal where you have a supermarket and a bus going to a big Metro station that leads you to the city. In total you need less than 30 minutes to get to Stockholm centre. We definetely recommend a stay at Margaretas place when visiting Stockholm if you want to stay at a very comfy place with great people in a quiet city near Stockholm.
2330,514210,36671659,2015-06-30,5456136,Kirsty,Brilliant host. Felt so at home and welcome!!! Great neighbourhood and good transportation links to centre. Would stay again!! 
2331,514210,36963495,2015-07-03,32963440,Vivien,"Margareta's apartment is absolutely wonderful! The location is safe and beautiful, although a bit far from Stockholm center and Old Town. Margareta is a thoughtful and kind host, willing to help us with whatever we needed. The room was nice, large, and clean, and it had a balcony overlooking the small, picturesque road leading to the house. Overall, it was an amazing experience. I would really recommend Margareta's place and would absolutely stay there again the next time I visit Stockholm. "
2332,514210,40488437,2015-07-31,37442122,Yavuz,"We stayed with Margareta for 3 nights and had a great time with her. She is talkative and very helpful. The room we stayed in was clean and spacious with a comfortable bed, the balcony was filled with flowers and had a beautiful view, great for having a cup of tea in the mornings. We got space in the fridge and were able to use the kitchen for home cooked meals. The city center and Old Town were easy to reach with the bus that stops three minutes from her place. She provided us with travel cards for the public transport. There was also a store nearby where you can get groceries for a reasonable price. Thank you for making us welcome Margaret. If there will be a next time we would like to stay with her again and we would recommend this place to everybody. "
2333,514210,44179519,2015-08-24,19569688,Maggie,"These 3 weeks, that me and my boyfriend, passed in Margareta's airbnb were wonderful. As hosts Margareta and her children are really warm and helpful. 

We arrived late from the airport and Margareta kindly drove us from Stockholm center to her accommodation. It roughly took 15 minutes by car but you are already in place full of nature, peaceful and close-by a swimmable lake. By the public transportation which is highly efficient (bus + subway), the same track takes 30min maximum.

Margareta's accommodation itself is a pretty big apartment, clean and tidy. You are hosted in a really conformtable room, have a private bathroom and access to the balcony where you can enjoy a peaceful breakfast surrounded by flowers. The apartment is located 2min by walk from a supermarket and the bus station. It is also well placed for outside activities lovers. It is the best Airbnb we experienced so far.

Even more than the accommodation, we highly appreciated our hosts. Margereta is a clever woman, joyful and interesting.  She helped us to carry our apartment research and discover Sweden and Swedish. We also had fun with anthon & Julia, her two smart and well-educated children. They make our staying even more appreciable!

We will definitely recommend to our family and friends!"
2334,514210,55343494,2015-12-01,36769336,Hiu Ching,"I stayed in Margareta place for 3 months. It was such a great stay there. The house is exactly the same as the photos shown and the room is really spacious and cozy, the balcony is full of flowers, decorated beautifully. Margareta arranged the cleaning for every two weeks to keep the room and the private toilet clean. The two kids are really kind and every time when I ask them for help, they are always willing to help. It takes like 25-30 mins to the city centre with transport of bus + metro. One thing concerns me is the bus sometimes runs only two times every hour on Sunday. So that it is  really important to check the schedule carefully. But that is only on Sunday. From Monday to Friday, every morning I go to work, the bus runs so frequently in the peak hour (ard 7-9 am). Overall, it is a really good place to stay! I definitely recommend this house."
2335,514210,58812450,2016-01-05,46626063,Franziska,"Margareta is a wonderful and kind host. The apartment is very nice, clean and the kitchen is very well equipped. The way to the citycentre is not too long (the bus connections are good, even in the night) and the walk to the supermarket takes 2 minutes. We're looking forward to come back soon."
2336,514210,60123229,2016-01-19,49317743,Marie,"We stayed 5 days in Margareta's beautiful apartment. We really loved our time there!
When we arrived her nice and polite kids picked us up from the bus stop. Our room looked exactly like pictures promised.
A close bus and train connection brought us downtown within 25 minutes.
We would have loved to stay longer and would totally recommend everyone to get hosted at this really nice place!!! "

2338,514210,80783905,2016-06-19,44637503,Anton,"We stayed with Margareta for 5 nights while we were visiting Stockholm. She came to pick us up from the central train station when we arrived to show us the way to her house with public transportation - very nice of her and super handy! Her house is easy to find and is 30 mins from Stockholm with a bus and a metro. Our room in Margareta's place was like in the pictures: big, nice space, with a door to her balcony. We also had a private bathroom and could use the kitchen for breakfast and dinner as we liked.

It was a very nice stay and we would definitely recommend!"
2339,514210,91358007,2016-08-05,19352024,Chiara,"Sono stata presso l'appartamento di Margareta per 6 giorni, tutto era preciso, pulito e la stanza addirittura più grande e accogliente che nella foto! Io e il mio ragazzo ci siamo trovati davvero bene, la nostra host è venuta a prenderci alla stazione centrale per mostrarci la strada più comoda per raggiungere la casa. La cosa in assoluto più piacevole è stata poter godersi la colazione nel terrazzo che affaccia sul verde e la passeggiata nel bosco del suo quartiere molto tranquillo. Consiglio vivamente questa esperienza!"
2340,514210,107995373,2016-10-13,52767683,Sophia,"We have felt very welcomed during our stay of almost seven weeks at Margareta's place. She had made sure we found our way to the flat and even asked someone to welcome us and show us around, as she couldn't be there. Margareta and her two children have been very kind and helpful. The room and the bathroom look like they do in the pictures. Everything has been very clean. 
It takes about 20 minutes to go to Stockholm central station. Therefore you have to take a bus for 10 minutes and the metro for another 10 minutes. It was very easy to find everything, as the bus station is also only 3 minutes away by walking from the flat.  
The flat is located in a family friendly neighbourhood. There is a supermarket very close, as well. 

We would definitely recommend staying at Margareta's place! "
2341,514210,112880030,2016-11-08,97407650,Lorena," I absolutely loved Margareta's apartment and i don't even know where to start because our stay was perfect! Everything was so nice and clean and it was really easy to reach her place from the airport beacuse she gave us detailed descriptions with pictures. It was really helpful. Also, it was my first time visting Sweden and considering the fact it was cold at this time of the year it was important for us that the apartemnt was warm. Everything was so cozy and warm. It was great we could use the kitchen and make tea. Both me and my friend enjoyed our stay because the room was so spacious and we had even more than we needed. The bed as well was so comfortable to sleep. I can't forget the view from the balcony, my friend even saw two deers from the window! It was snowing which made the atmosphere even lovelier. It was really wonderful, i have to say definitely one of the best experiences i had. Me and my friend were alone for most of our stay in the apartement and only briefly met Margareta and her children. They are really nice and they made us feel welcomed. Also, the city center is really easy to reach with the bus and metro, the area is nice and safe and you have a store nearby. Highly recommending to everyone who is traveling to Stockholm! :)"
2342,514210,123633330,2016-12-30,52299409,Caroline,"Margareta is the best host ever. 
I stayed three months to her home, she has become a friend to me. Whenever I come back to Stockholm, this is the place to be to me.
Very helpful, kind, open-minded, you can rather share moments or spend time alone, there is always the feeling you are at your own home.
Super clean, close to everything you would need, buses are very close.
Central but also close to Nature.

l'arrêt de bus est à 2 minutes à pied et il n'y a qu'un changement pour arriver au centre donc c'est très rapide. et les transports fonctionnent tard donc on peut sortir en ville et rentrer tranquillement.
il y a un supermarché juste à côté pour faire quelques courses, super pratique.
et malgré ça, le quartier est hyper tranquille et près de la nature."

Having breakfast on the terrace with the forest view and birds singing was great. The communication with host was smooth and easy. Although the flat is 30min away from Stockholm Central, it is very easy to get there by public transport.
Highly recommended:)"

She helped us whenever we had questions and even lent us an umbrella when it was a rainy day.

The room is exactly how it shows in the pictures: very comfortable bed, big and beautiful balcony that you will have access to, and a private bathroom with a nice shower. 
The location is very convenient. Three minutes walk to a local center with supermarkets, butiques, restaurants and buses that takes you to a metro station in 10 min.

My parents only speak Spanish and they had no problems talking to Margareta, since she also speaks some Spanish.

The location looks far at first, but getting there is quite easy and straightforward. The balcony has a nice view, full of green and nature."

The information provided by her was of immense value and her house is located at a comfortable place, just walk for a minute to reach the grocery store and bus stop. The personal touch of picking us up , showing the route , grocery store, providing the access cards and dropping us back , was great. We are touched by the kind gesture. She has two lovely children and all of them made us feel at home. We would recommend staying at her place."

We enjoyed our daily walks in the forest.
However, I would like to say something about the bed which is soft and not really a double bed as we expected.  This can be an issue for anyone with back problems."

The master bedroom was well outfitted with crib, cradle, and changing table, and the toddler's room was well stocked with toys. Our boys so appreciated playing with all the toys! The location was very nice - easy walking distance to park, playground, wading pool, grocery store, pizza, and sushi. Beds and couch were comfortable, and the kitchen had everything we needed. The laundry facilities on the main floor of the building worked well for us, and we washed a lot of clothes over 3 weeks! Would definitely recommend.  "
2366,526170,6145921,2013-08-01,5610780,Joakim,"We heartily recommend Andrea and this apartment for your visit to Stockholm! The location is great – only 3 fast subway stops from the central station. But it is also peaceful and quiet. A real “residential” feel rather than a loud, crowded tourist area. There is a grocery store with everything you need on the street corner (as well as a good pizza shop). A shopping center, library, playground, more restaurants, etc. are one subway stop away (or walking distance). There is also easy access to a vast network of walking and running trails that connect to a large nature reserve on the north side of Stockholm.

The apartment itself is bright and sunny, with big common rooms, a full kitchen, two bathrooms, a dining area, balcony, and two private bedrooms. There is also a shared laundry facility available with top notch washers and dryers. Our family of three had plenty of space to live for 4 weeks comfortably.

Andrea and her family were very friendly and helpful. They were easily accessible to answer questions and would periodically check in to see how we were doing. We would gladly return for another stay. A true asset to airbnb!"
2367,526170,17090157,2014-08-07,5610780,Joakim,"This is our second time renting this particular apartment (which in and of itself says how much we like it). It is exactly as described, a very family friendly apartment, elegant, airy and open, in a neighborhood that strikes a perfect balance between being quiet and having easy access to the subway, shopping, playgrounds, parks, and other amenities. Magnus, our host, is superfriendly, helpful, and was always accessible when we had a question. We look forward to staying here again!"
2368,526170,34864809,2015-06-13,14798015,Arlene,"We really loved our 10 day stay at Magnus' wonderful comfortable and quiet apartment. All of our questions were easily and promptly answered by email before we arrived, and Magnus met us at the apartment when we arrived and showed us all around. The apartment itself is very spacious, light-filled, clean, and cheerful. It has beautiful wood floors, a good size and well-equipped, easy to use kitchen, and one powder room and one small full bath with tub and shower. We only used the master bedroom, which has a king size very comfortable and firm bed and black out shades, which was nice as it was nearly midsummer and very light at night! There is also another bedroom for children. The apartment is really quiet, with no street noise or noise from other apartments. The area of the city is friendly, safe, and great for walking, with lots of trees, flowers, and birds. There is a lovely park five minutes away. Markets and restaurants are easy to find nearby. It was a very pleasant 20 minute walk into the central areas, depending where one was going. The metro is only a two minute walk and is very fast, frequent, and clean and goes anywhere one is likely to want to go. We really liked the neighborhood and found it the perfect location for seeing Stockholm and taking day trips. Magnus was a great host and we had a perfect stay. Thank you! "
2369,526170,40725833,2015-08-02,5610780,Joakim,"This is our third time renting this lovely apartment. It is spacious, airy, elegantly furnished, and situated in a location that manages to combine convenience and quiet. Magnus is readily available to answer any questions and we have always felt well taken care of. It is a pleasure to rent from him."
2370,526170,42538097,2015-08-14,36188949,Christine,"This is a great flat centrally located in stockholm, great quiet location just a few train stops or a walk from the old town. The flat is very comfortable, clean, with one master bed and one kids room/bunkbed with lots of natural light and airy. Great kitchen and building and perfect for exploring stockholm. Magnus made us very welcome, was there to warmly welcome us when we arrived and ensure we had everything we needed and was available for any questions during our stay. We would recommend this to anyone wanting to visit stockholm! "
2371,526170,43784072,2015-08-22,15057760,Dr. Amnon,"Magnus was a wonderful host- he made us extremely welcome and let us feel right at home. His apartment was just as it was advertised, a family friendly, comfortable and clean home, with a good kitchen, a nice dining area, a large and comfotable living room and 2 bedrooms.  The building is a nice pre-war structure with elevators and automatic doors plus a trash shute on each floor. It is situated in a very friendly and safe neigborhood just outside of downtown (you can even walk downtown if you are not in a hurry). The T station is literatlly 4 minutes walking by foot, meaning that you can be downtown in less than 20 minutes door to door. The nighborhood has a small supermarket that is open from 0700AM till 1100 PM as well as a few restaurants (we enjoyed the Sushi). In Short, this apartment has a lot going for it: a wonderful, helpful and friendly host, a wonderful place to stay a week as a family, and a good location. We will be more than happy to come here again!"

I confidently recommend you this apartment house where you can fully enjoy an extremely comfortable and convenient garden city life. Magnus is a host who provides kind communication in time with his guest in perfect English. He lives in neighborhood and provides services in accordance with guest’s request.

The subway station Gärdet is located in a quiet residential area surrounded by rich greeneries while its access from Stockholm Central Station is very convenient with taking only 6 minutes. It takes only 3 minutes on foot from a ground exit where you can directly ascend by a lift from ticket gates of the station Gärdet. A supermarket located beside the exit offers perfect items in a reasonable price, which is extremely convenient. 

You can also reach a bus stop for No.54 bus in a 4-minute-walk on a downhill footpath in the forest to the west. I fully recommend a cozy Thai restaurant located on the way because its great taste, quality and reasonable price.

A wide living and dining room, the main bedroom with a queen size bed, another bedroom with bunk beds, an easy-to-use kitchen kept tidy and in order, a bathroom with an sufficiently wide bathtub and toilet and another lavatory are well equipped. All windows consist double glasses and you can enjoy a tea time in the balcony."
2374,526170,47793068,2015-09-21,28844609,Andrea,"I would not hesitate to hire the apartement again. Comfortable and cozy. Everything is there, what you need. WiFi works perfect. The kitchen is well equipped. The location to the city is ideal. The metro is around the corner and it takes only a few stops to get to the city. We did everything on foot, that is no problem as well. Supermarket and restaurants are near by. From Airport it will take about 35 minutes to the apartement by taxi. Magnus is a very good host, friendly and responds to any questions (mail / SMS) very quickly.  I recommend the apartment definitely!"

2377,530454,519431679,2019-08-28,243347916,Juliet,"Really fascinated by the tour created by Welly! He told a lot from history, but in an easy and funny way, so that it did not sound like a boring history lesson but like an exciting story. Many secret spots have been shown and the secrets of Paris revealed. You'll fall in love with the city even more after the 3h evening tour with Welly! I loved the way he told the jokes and showed some street art on the way, we talked about life in Paris and France in general, that has been awesome. And the group was not big, very nice people. The view of Paris from the rooftops is breathtaking! Unforgettable, the next time in Paris will surely try one more tour by Welly! Recommended!!!"
2378,530454,525274267,2019-09-07,6314388,Annette,Enjoyed seeing Paris from very different locations that you would not otherwise have known about.
2379,530454,525274734,2019-09-07,6995565,Adele,"Welly knows his stuff and is a great guide; engaging, personable and all around likeable. This tour took us to some great views that yes, we could technically go to ourselves, but we’d have to know about them, and even if we had, we wouldn’t have had the fantastic background information, setting the scene the whole way. Would be a great orientation tour for your first night in Paris."
2380,530454,528165501,2019-09-12,37272510,Sandy And Ryan,Welly was a great tour guide! We learned so much about how the city came to be. He had a deep understanding of history and architecture. We recommend!
2381,530454,531882073,2019-09-18,11277788,Michelle,We met as a group of strangers and left as friends. Welly was a delightful local guide and the rooftop views he shared with us weren’t something we would have found on our own. We highly recommend. Thanks for sharing your knowledge and experience with us Welly!
2382,530454,531882156,2019-09-18,230526190,Arik,The tour was informative and exciting. The views were spectacular from different angles and you really did get to see all of the city highlights. The walking wasn’t overly hard. And I felt the distance could be covered by anyone at any age level. I’m really happy Welly offers this tour and that we happened upon it. I would highly recommend you try it!

2385,533880,1526698,2012-06-20,1656738,Katelyn,Jarl was a delight. He gave me detailed instructions on how to get to the place along with every accommodation needed while I was there. Bonus: I loved meeting his adorable children.
2386,533880,1583686,2012-06-28,1510582,Vroni,"It was great staying with Jarl. It was very central, we could walk into town, Jarl told us about the town, and Stockholm was a great experience. I hope we'll be back one day : )"

Really helpful host and great room. No complaints!"
2388,533880,1805669,2012-07-26,2401123,Lisa,"I really loved to stay with Jarl!
He was great host, really caring. He helped me with directions from the airport to the apartment as well with tips like where to find the best bread.
For a few days of my stay he wasn't there but he always kept contact over phone and email, so I never felt alone at all. Plus, I really had my privacy!
The apartment is in a nice neighbourhood, all the public transport is very near and you""ll be in the old town in 10 minutes.
I highly recommend staying with Jarl! Great Airbnb-Host!"
2389,533880,1853193,2012-07-31,2947011,James,"Our stay was great. Jarl provided us with fresh bread and breakfast each day, offered us lovely International beers from his own fridge and even got us some typical Swedish buns for our journey home! The sauna was a nice way to relax after a busy day of sightseeing.
The apartment is in a good location for walking into the centre and there's a 7-Eleven at the end of the street for bits and pieces.
Thanks Jarl!"
2390,533880,1869907,2012-08-02,197058,Ekaterina,"Perfect location: half way between the city center and the ferry terminals, the old town is reachable by foot in 15-20 minutes only. Jarl was very welcoming, everything was nicely prepared. Breakfast was provided, coffee, tea, fresh bread, eggs, milk... basically everything :) We had our privacy, it really felt like home. Great place, we highly recommend it for anyone going to Stockholm!!"

I suggest this accomodation!"
2394,533880,2072930,2012-08-23,1196382,Matthew,"An excellent experience all-around. Jarl's room is probably the first AirBnB room I would readily return to, if I had the opportunity. Jarl is low-key and helpful. Fridge is stocked with the essential. Jarl also provides maps and brochures to help you navigate Stockholm. Highly recommended! "
2395,533880,2109612,2012-08-27,2797940,Minouk,"We had a very pleasant stay at Jarl's. The room was very tidy and light. The bathroom is a bit small, but has a good shower and is really clean. Jarl provided breakfast and we could get anything from the fridge we wanted, this was very practical since we didn't have to decide at what time we would get out of bed. The house is really central, a 5 minute walk to T-bana station 'Stadion'. But you can easily walk to Gamla Stan as well, it took us about 20 minutes. 
Tack sa mycket Jarl! 
"
2396,533880,2138469,2012-08-29,3322716,César,"Jarl es un excelente anfitrión y siempre está dispuesto a ayudarte o resolver cualquier duda que te pueda surgir. En mi caso estuve en Estocolmo por unas entrevistas de trabajo y me fue de gran ayuda de cara a resolver las dudas que tenía sobre el coste de la vida allí.

Además el apartamento está muy bien situado.  En una zona muy tranquila en todos los aspectos sin apenas ruido pero a la vez muy bien comunicada por metro y autobús. O si lo prefieres en unos 20 minutos andando te plantas en la zona centro.

Jarl is a great host who is always willing to help or answer any questions you may have. In my case I was in Stockholm for some job interviews so he help me a lot by answering my questions related with life-cost.

The apartment is very well located. A very quiet area but well connected by metro and bus. You can also reach the center by walking in 20 minutes."
2397,533880,2193677,2012-09-04,3059872,Lisa,The room was nice and very tidy. The flat is located quite close in the centre in a nice neighbourhood. Jarl was very attentive and friendly. The rooms in the flat are at different ends of the corridor which ensures a great deal of privacy. I had a very pleasent stay at Jarl's flat! The only downside was the comparably slow internet connection.
2398,533880,2250655,2012-09-10,3161516,Jeongwon,"I arrived Jarl’s house at late, but he welcomed us warmly. I stayed his house for two nights and I had a really great time at there! 
The guest room is very clean and cozy as just like pictures. The bathroom was right next the room, So it was really convenient for me! You are also allowed to use his kitchen and you can have some bread and cereal for breakfast. I felt very easy in his house. Jarl is really friendly and thoughtful person. If I had chance to visit Stockholm, I would contact him again!

The instruction he provided made it very easy for me to find my way in when he wasn't there. Smooth communications during my stay. The apartment is very clean, cozy, quiet, and well-located.

It's located in a nice area close to the city center, so you can get anywhere without any issues. I only met with Jarl once, but he was really nice and so helpful- I was sick and he helped me find medicine! He was helpful with any of our questions, and provided us with breakfast,which was much appreciated. I loved Stockholm, and I will look into staying here again if I come back!"

His flat is located in a very quiet neighbourhood, near the Karlaplan subway station, and within walking distance of Djurgarden. The bed was very comfortable, and the bedroom was nice and spacious. Jarl is a very friendly host and most helpful. I would not hesitate to contact him again should I return to Stockholm in the future. "
2430,533880,4577444,2013-05-13,5983471,Donata,"I enjoyed the apartment and the place where it is located. Not so far from city centre. Moreover you can have access to sauna and gym. Jarl is really nice, and gentle. "
2431,533880,4795719,2013-05-26,6370245,Katrin,"Basic accommodation in a private bedroom with top-location on quiet street, yet very central. Clean and tidy. Friendly and helpful host."
2432,533880,5021343,2013-06-08,6041595,Laura,"For a city trip to Stockholm it is just perfect to stay with Jarl. There is a 15 minutes walk to the center but the area is extremely calm, peaceful and nice - and Jarl is such a helpful and friendly host!"
2433,533880,5175929,2013-06-17,4068190,Dirk,The room is a very quit place to stay. 5 minutes to the sub. Jarl is a friendly and uncomplicated host. Every thing was well organized. I could enter the flat despite Jarl´s absence. In my opinion a very recommendable adress. 
2434,533880,5801169,2013-07-16,4348292,Andy,"Jarl left me the best bread I ever had in Sweden! Although I didn't meet him, he arranged everything perfectly and answered all my questions about getting around, laundry, etc, promptly. The room was clean and spacious and only a 5 minute Metro ride to the old town. There's a 7-11 at the corner for your late night ice cream craving and a good cheap Thai takeaway 5 minutes walk away. If you know how expensive things are in Sweden, you'll know this is a Godsend. Last but not least, the shower is hot and has strong water pressure. The apartment has a good feel about it. I highly recommend it. "
2435,533880,6401277,2013-08-11,7498990,Victor,The flat is not far from the metro station and the center of the city. Jarl is very nice and his bicycle cards were useful. So I recommand this address.
2436,533880,6687866,2013-08-21,7369755,Lukas,"Great room for any activities in Stockholm! Jarl is a great host even though I was not able to meet him in person. Maybe next time. He's really flexible and don't hesitate to ask him anything you might need (an iPhone charger in my case).

The area is great as well! I checked out the Thai take away and the Chinese place and both were a good choice to get nice meals."
2437,533880,7221418,2013-09-11,5201018,Kimberly,"WOW!  If you're looking for a place to stay in Stockholm's most prestigious area, look no further.  Jarl's place is a 5-8 minute walk to the Stadion T (subway) stop.  Then it's one stop to Ostermalm, the ""Rodeo Drive"" area of Stockholm, and one more stop to Central Station, in the heart of Stockholm and easy transfers to any other subway line.  

The room is peaceful and functional.  I found the bed very comfortable.  It's basic and clean.  It's at ground level, but extremely quiet at night on his street.  For the price Jarl is charging, it's a steal.   I still can't believe the incredible value for money and feel so lucky I stumbled upon it on AirBnB.  

Jarl's place is very close to Djurgarden, the gorgeous, fairy-tale-like island in Stockholm Harbor, where the main tourist attractions are located, like the Vasa Museum and Skansen.  Do venture there and do not miss Rosendal's Tragard, a lovely organic farm and cafe, with pastoral outdoor seating areas and great food.  

Jarl is a very kind and wonderful host.   He totally respects your privacy yet is available whenever you need his assistance.  I needed to get up for an early-ish flight home and he gave me a second alarm clock so I could make sure to be up in time.  He also printed out an email I needed to show the airline on check-in.

I highly recommend Jarl's place.  Enjoy your time in magical Stockholm!

2438,533880,7354783,2013-09-16,1584178,Stefankai,"Jarl is an excellent and caring host. He replied promptly to my request and sent invitation e-mail with all necessary information and description to find the flat in Stockholm.
I met Jarl the next day and apart from preparing breakfast with the rich contents of his fridge, I was allowed to use one of hi bike cards to rent one of Stockholm's bikes for free.
Room, kitchen, bathroom and flat are in perfect shape and pleasantly located north of Östermalm district and very close to Djurgården island.
Highly recommended! A great value-for-money!"
2439,533880,7448477,2013-09-20,7643099,Mehmet Aydın,"Great experience overall. The location of the apartment is easy to find and get around from. The room is spacious, clean, well-equipped and very comfortable. The bathroom is not large but again well-equipped, practical and comfortable. The kitchen is also well-equipped and convenient. Everything in the house works properly and Jarl lets you use the kitchen equipment, provides towels etc. (he even gave me detergent for the laundry) Aside from the material qualities of the accomodations, Jarl is a great host and a generous man who is always keen to keep his guests happy. He is always ready provide assistance when needed, both regarding how things work around the house and how things work in Stockholm in general. My 4-night stay at Jarl's place was extremely comfortable and I would recommend the room to anyone traveling to Stockholm."
2440,533880,7607362,2013-09-26,7399409,Daniel,"Jarl was a great host, very helpful and accommodating. I had a good stay at his place and everything was just as advertised. The place is in a convenient location with easy access to subways. I would definitely stay at this place again."
2441,533880,7789951,2013-10-03,7662287,Rob,"Jarl is a courteous and gracious host. He is an excellent resource on Stockholm and Sweden generally. He went above and beyond to ensure a pleasant stay.  The room is also excellent, quite large with a nice desk."
2442,533880,8049868,2013-10-14,7981308,Derald,"We had a very good stay and experience with Jari.  The room was good, the bed was just barely wide enough for two but we managed.  Jari was very helpful and friendly.  It is a short walk to the subway for a short, two stop ride to the city center.  
We were able to walk from the Tallink ferry terminal, but the trip from the train station is longer and would need the subway.
We had a very good experience her and recommend this place."
2443,533880,8355508,2013-10-27,3961641,Lila,"I definetley recommend Jarl's flat the location is great, and the flat is clean and plesant,
The host is very nice and helpful.
I Will come back again..."
2444,533880,8706889,2013-11-12,9787323,Eva,"Stayed with Jarl for one night in Stockholm. Great location, very good instructions of how to get there, a lovely and clean room and such a friendly host. I would definitely come again."
2445,533880,9028367,2013-12-02,9790123,Candice,"We spent a weekend in Stockholm, it  was our first time in Sweden and it was great! We arrived on a Friday afternoon at Jarl's place thanks to his precise instructions and he was there to welcome us with his daughters. He showed us everything including the sauna (that he booked for us!). Then he gave us the keys and only came back on the Sunday morning. The apartment was really comfy and well equipped. We were 3 adults and we all had our own bed. The flat is very well located: quiet area, 2 metro stations within walking distance (Stadion and Karlaplan), a shopping center, several bus lines... A nice place where we would happily stay again and that we recommend!"
2446,533880,10177844,2014-02-04,10962897,Jeannine,"I enjoyed my stay at this room very much :-)
The room is great, tidily and large enough for one person to live there comfortably. The flat is very clean and nice. 
Jarl is a very nice, helpful and caring person, giving you your privacy. The position of this room is perfect. It is a peaceful area, but it took you only 2 subway stations to be at the central station and within the city. KTH is also not far away (for all exchange students ;)).
There is only one tiny thing to say: the walls are quiet thin so the flat is quiet clairaudient. So if you want to sleep long in the morning check whether Jarls (very lovely!) kids are there. Because they are kids, it could get a little bit louder ;-) But he will tell you whether they are there or not before confirming your booking. 
Personally, I can really recommend the room and the host :-) It was very nice and I will come back if I'm looking for an accommodation in Stockholm again."
2447,533880,10231051,2014-02-08,11075931,Janis,I cannot fault Jarl on his instructions; he answered emails almost instantly and the directions to his apartment were excellent.   The room was very comfortable and more than adequate for my needs.  Jarl was very friendly without being intrusive and made me feel very welcome in his home. I would definitely recommend his apartment to others planning to visit Stockholm. 
2448,533880,10401530,2014-02-17,9488915,John,"Jarl provided a very quiet and clean room for my girlfriend and I to stay in whilst visiting Stockholm. While his apartment may not have been a five star hotel, it was close to public transit and in a nice area of town. There was a grocery store near by so we were able to do all make all of our own dinners which saved us a lot of money. He was also very friendly and gave us tips on what it's like to be an AirBNB host. Overall we had a great time while visiting Stockholm and found Jarl's home a nice place to spend our evenings. "
2449,533880,10610016,2014-02-27,12061107,Sjoerd,"Jarl was relaxed in de omgang en met het beschikbaar stellen van de sleutel, afhandelen van de kamer (mochten tot in de avond de kamer gebruiken), nam de tijd om onze vragen over Stockholm te beantwoorden en was sociaal. Kamer was ruim voldoende om te overnachten. Het was schoon genoeg en we hebben ons niet beperkt gevoeld door zijn dagritme en aanwezigheid."
2450,533880,10896907,2014-03-11,3493408,Christina,Great host and neighborhood! Jarl was a lovely host. The room is just as it appears in the pictures and some toiletries are available in case you forgot something. Highly recommended!
2451,533880,11350623,2014-03-31,8932423,Mark,"We spent a sunny weekend in Stockholm and Jarl's room was the perfect home base. It's very close to the Stadion metro station, or if you like walking you can get there from the central area through the beautiful Ostermalmen neighbourhood in about half an hour. Jarl is easy to reach and quick to respond to emails. He was very flexible about check-in and check-out times."
2452,533880,11727308,2014-04-13,6602786,Karl,"I stayed at Jarl's place 3 nights in april 2014. It was a very nice experience: nice and clean room, very quiet but close to center of town, either by walking or public transport, host very nice and interesting man to talk with. I can highly recommend it."
2453,533880,11951637,2014-04-20,12077727,Trine,"We were 3 Danish girls visiting Stockholm in April 2014 and we had a perfect stay in Jarls apartment. Jarl had arranged it all in advance and it was very easy to find the apartment and the key due to his instructions. Jarl was not home during our stay, but we had frequently contact with him and he was very helpful and nice. Overall we enjoyed our stay very much and we give our recommendation. "
2454,533880,12295810,2014-04-28,13776367,Frank,"Jarl was a really nice host, and everything worked good, especially the communication. It was my first airbnb stay, and I can really recommend visiting him. Also the bed was really comfortable :)"
2455,533880,13290012,2014-05-24,5821201,Juan,"It was great to stay with Jarl. I went for a short business trip to Stockholm and it was the perfect place to stay. Jarl was very nice, always ready to help and always reachable. The neighborhood is very nice and quiet, and you have good public transportation nearby. I did not have any problem finding the place nor moving around."
2456,533880,13435994,2014-05-27,10782809,Christophe,"We had a very nice stay at Jarl's. The area is very quiet yet central, ca. 10 mins walking distance from the city centre. The flat was very clean and the room pleasant. Everything was very well organized prior to arrival and Jarl also gave us some recommendations on places to eat, to go and how to best get there. We can only recommend. Thanks again!"
2457,533880,13647219,2014-06-02,11291402,Howard,"Jarl is a kind, considerate and professional host who gives 100% to his clients and only asks in return that you respect his property and possessions.  
I used the sauna, found the laundry room to be an excellent asset also and everyone I encountered was helpful and language issues for English speakers were minimal.  Jarl provided comprehensive transport, food and building access advice as well as a perfect internet access.
I wish more AirBNB suppliers offered the same level of diligence.
The Stockholm Marathon was epic and I hope to visit Jarl again in the future but for longer.
Thanks Jarl you were a credit to Stockholm and the AirBNB community.

Take care

Howard

2458,533880,13966970,2014-06-09,2189609,Kate,Jarl is extremely nice and helpful. The apartment is located in a very centrally located area with tree lined boulevards and upscale shops. It was easy to get around using the underground train. We stayed in one room in Jarl's apartment. We shared the bathroom and kitchen with Jarl and either his kids or another airbnb guest. Jarl also provided breakfast which was a pleasant surprise.
2459,533880,14161912,2014-06-13,13300637,Ada,"I stay tree nights at room, it's so nice and cozy! The room shows the same with pictures, it's clean and bright. Jarl is a nice host, he'll prepare everything in advance and provide any help. The community is just 10 minutes to the central station, supermarket/ metro/ bus all are nearby. This is my first tour alone, the Stockholm is a beautiful city, i can't wait my next vacation could be Stockholm again. Hope can visit here soon !"

I slept on the cot and it was surprisingly comfortable. Jarl was accommodating, and allowed us to drop off our luggage early so we could explore Stockholm during the day. The distance to the city is perfectly walkable, although Jarl allowed us to use his City bike card which was wonderful and saved us so much time!"
2462,533880,14384286,2014-06-18,10946850,Franziska,"Jarl had been a friendly and very flexible host.

Venlig modtagelse.
Vi var lidt usikre på dele køkken og bad,men det fungerede bare perfekt.
Og alt i gå afstand var jo perfekt.

L'appartement est clair, très propre.

I always felt safe even when returning late in the evening. There is a small convenience store right on the corner for essentials like milk and juice. It is very clean and even though Jarl could not be there during my stay, he did his best to make me feel welcome in his absence. I was grateful that he had cereal and very nice coffee that I could have for breakfast.  He was very helpful and sympathetic to all my concerns, and he always answered emails promptly. The room is exactly as shown in the photos, light and well equipped. I would definitely recommend to others. Thank you Jarl!"

But when I saw the room and the flat my concerns were gone. Everything was like shown in the pictures and Jarl was a good host, even though he wasn't there all the time. He is a really nice person and answered to my questions by mail very fast. The flat was clean and I felt in good hands. Thank you for that, Jarl, I will definitively do airnbnb again! Whenever you come to Munich, just let me know. Take care and all the best for you!"

The place is located in a convenient position. It takes a 5-minute walk to the metro station and bus stations which are connected to most of the places in Stockholm. There are good restaurants around too. To sum up, it was a great experience staying in Jarl's place and I would highly recommend his place to everyone."
2470,533880,23646839,2014-12-07,23698434,Sandro,Jarl is a very caring person and acts with a great deal of hospitality. He makes you feel that his home is your home. The room is fresh and the bathroom is just outside the room. The area is quite and still just a short walk from city centre. 
2471,533880,30043289,2015-04-16,30466031,Lauri,"Majoittaja oli vastassa, kun menin asunnolle. Tuntui, kuin olisin mennyt vanhan kaverin luokse. Huone oli oikein siisti ja kuvauksen mukainen. Tämä oli ensimmäinen AirBnB-majoittumiseni ja olen iloinen, että se oli Jarlin luona.

Suosittelen!!"
2472,533880,30797959,2015-04-27,12035634,Peter,Jarl's apartment was in a good central location (only two stops from Central station!). Supermarket and bakery 2 minutes walk away. Jarl was friendly and welcoming. Great guy and great price for where you stay! Would definitely recommend it

He provided me with lots of tips about the city and directions I places. He always responded so quickly to all my question. The room itself was perfect for me, very bright, clean and big.

Place is in a great location, close to Karlaplan trains which take you on a 5min journey to Central where you can start Stockholm exploring! 

Room was as described, quiet, calm and perfect size for a traveller. Bed was reasonably comfy too. 

Would stay again. Thanks Jarl!"

He was on holidays during my stay so I was by myself. The room is very central, near to Stadion tube station, buses, and you can reach a lot of places in the city by walking distance. 15 min by foot to Strandvägen... WOW.  Absolutely calm and safe area. Great experience, tack Jarl!  "

His place was at calm area and just some minutes after I went into the room, I felt very comfortable with silent and warm atmosphere. Also could reach the city center in just about 20 minutes by walking and I enjoyed finding out the pretty shops, cafe, and famous indoor market on the way. 
Jarl was very practical host, so the communication before and after check-in was smooth. He gave me a tip about the city and kindly searched how I could get there. Also he was flexible. Thanks to his offer, I could keep my stuff at his place after check-out and it was so helpful for me."

He was away traveling during much of my stay, but he still took care to make sure I had everything I needed and familiarized me with the building. He’s friendly, easy-going and quick to reach.  His apartment is central to many areas in Stockholm, and is also close to the local nightlife areas.  The room itself is quite large, much more than I was expecting for a city apartment."
2489,533880,297923209,2018-07-28,50101206,Seung Jin,"I highly recommend his room!
Room is comfortable, cozy, and clean. 
I think location of this room is perfect for traveler.
Although he was not in his house during my staying period, but his feedback was immediate, accurate, and perfect.
Everything I need was in this house, so it was so comfortable.
Even I cancel my left reservation because my schedule changed, but he deeply understand my situation and keep kindness until I check out.
After I check out, he permit to left my bags in his house because he consider my situation.
There is no doubt to stay in his house.
If I have a chance to travel in Stockholm, I will stay his house again!!
Jarl, I will not forget your appreciation!"

A few questions came up during my stay and Paolo was super helpful and responded very quickly. (Thanks, Paolo!) Sodermalm is the hip and happening part of Stockholm and this apartment is in the perfect location in the heart of Sodermalm. Everything you need is in walking distance including subway stop, supermarket, restaurants, cafes, bars, etc. The pictures posted are exactly what the place looks like. The kitchen is very modern and nice and well equipped and having a large, spacious bathroom with a full tub is a rare pleasure in Europe, in my experience. "
2492,536283,2313718,2012-09-17,3347127,Daniela,"I was staying in Paolo´s apartment with two friends for three nights. The location of the apartment is great, it´s in a quiet street but only a couple of minutes walk to lots of bars and restaurants and a nice shopping street. Paolo was very heplful and gave us a lot of information about things to do in Stockholm before our trip. He always responded quickly to any questions. The hand over of the keys went smoothly and the apartment was very tidy and suited our purposes. I can recommend it!"
2493,536283,2745294,2012-10-29,3488584,Seilram,it's a very nice an cosy appartement in a very great area. we enjoyed very much to stay there!!!!!!!!!!
2494,536283,3257514,2013-01-03,2553957,Isaac,"Great, fairly large studio apartment right in the heart of Södermalm, Stockholm. Close to a metro stop (t end up going places too often. Nice furnishings (although spartan), pleasing to the eye. New kitchen appliances and a nice bathroom + tub. Super fast Internet connection. The bed is on the small side for two people but Paolo was nice to set up an extra mattress for us in case we needed it. The host was very nice, friendly, and fast in all interactions I had with him and both getting the keys and checking out were as easy as it gets. Would definitely come back, apartment is recommended for anyone wanting to experience Stockholm."
2495,536283,3282490,2013-01-05,81688,Adam,Paolo was a very accommodating host. When our train was delayed he came late to give us our keys without hesitation. He has  a wonderful flat  right in the heart of it all. I wouldn't hesitate to stay again.
2496,536283,3429580,2013-01-28,2064497,Valeria,"Our stay at Paolo's flat was super great!! Excellent communication, he answers quickly to the messages. We didn't meet but it was not a problem, he gave us all the instructions to follow.
We have appreciated that he stays so discrete, we really felt that we were at home. The apartment is just in an excellent area, the subway is not far, so it is very easy to visit the city. You will be in the most trendy area with a lot of coffees and shops. 
The flat was clean and exactly what we need, it looks like in the pictures. We have appreciated the neutral decoration. 
So we recommend you a lot Paolo and his flat. We will return for sure.
"
2497,536283,3502867,2013-02-09,4698781,Juli,Location was perfect for our needs.  Paolo was very attentive via text - even at 3 am when we were locked out because we didn't realize how the key worked at night. I forgot my phone and he put it in the mail immediately. 
2498,536283,3889136,2013-03-25,384233,Sarah,"Paolo's place was great, perfect location and really nice. It was also super easy to organize everything with Paolo."
2499,536283,4075740,2013-04-08,5092408,Martin,"We had a great stay in this perfect located and clean apartment, close to everything. Paolo was very helpful and quick to respond our questions. Recommended!"
2500,536283,4197389,2013-04-17,2740344,Morten,"Nice, comfortable and clean. Paolo was flexible with arrival/departure times. Flat is well located in Södremalm close to underground and thus easy to get to from the Central Station (airport trains and busses). Supermarkets, resturants and none-chain shops are within easy reach. Stay greatly appriciated and recommend."
2501,536283,4450338,2013-05-06,5546271,Anya,"Paolo might be slightly disappointed but we did used china and we did slept on bed sheets) When we entered the apartment we found it absolutely lovely, clean and cozy so we just tried to return it back to Paolo in that initial look. The apartment suited us perfectly. Indeed, it is perfect in all possible senses: spacious enough for two, fully equipped, has a great location and Swedish charm. And when it comes to the charm, the old elevator in the building worth to be mentioned, too. It has a great location especially for those who'd like to stay in Södermalm, perhaps the most vibrant area in the city, during their visit to Stockholm. The Metro (Tunnelbana) station, supermarkets, pharmacy and variety of restaurants, cafes and pubs are all nearby, within 5 min walking distance. We also found a superb bakery just two blocks away. On the other hand, the street where apartment’s located is very quite. We were not disturbed by any noise neither from neighbors nor from the street during the night. 
Paolo is a great host as well. He answered to all requests with no delay, was precise and clear in his comments.  We tried hard but found nothing to complain about either the host or the apartment itself. Oh, wait, there was one thing: having found any possible kitchen stuff, including torch for creme brulee, we could not find but one small kitchen knife which was a bit difficult to use, especially with the bread. Next time when we come we’ll ask Paolo for one of his beautiful Japanese knifes we are sure he has somewhere!

2502,536283,4645606,2013-05-18,5133445,Sivan,We spent 5 days in the apartment. The location was perfect. Best neighborhood. Close to subway. Paulo was very nice and helpful. Actually we had everything we needed in the apartment. Highly recommended. 
2503,536283,4726611,2013-05-22,5165886,Jack,"Very quick and accurate response with any questions and concerns. The location is very convenient and close to the metro station. Checkin and out was very easy and hassle free. Quiet neighbourhood even though its considered a hipster/night life part of the city. Easy going, casual, whatever goes living space."
2504,536283,4771272,2013-05-25,1980503,Valter,"Had a lovely stay!  Paolo's apartment was perfect for me - located in a funky area of Stockholm, it was walking distance to good food and coffee, and the highlights of Stockholm.  The apartment was clean and comfortable, and I loved the style of the flat, and the cute old lift in the building.  The kitchen was well stocked and access to the computer was very handy for travelling.  Paolo was the perfect host too, very responsive to any request and he made the whole process of checking-in and out short and sweet.  I would definitely stay here again if given the chance to be in Stockholm again.  "
2505,536283,4858120,2013-05-29,837560,Jen & Alex,"Paolo's apartment was super conveniently located - very very close to the nearest train station (just two stops from the central train station), and right in the cool Sodermalm/Sofo district where there are tons of cute shops, cafes, restaurants, etc. (I'm in love with the area...have to go back!). The apartment was spacious and full of light, which we both loved, and I was happy to get to use his imac to look things up online."
2506,536283,5089058,2013-06-11,2205481,Nicholas,Paolo was an excellent host and his apartment was wonderful. Communication with Paolo was flawless before and during my stay. The apartment was clean and tidy when I arrived and everything worked as expected.
2507,536283,5330738,2013-06-24,3279725,Rebekah,"Very beautiful, clean, and spacious apartment. I LOVED the location - very central from the train station and lots of restaurants, cafes, nightlife, two grocery stores, walking, and people watching. In fact, even after exploring Stockholm, this was my favorite neighborhood! It was also very quiet at night in spite of being near so much. We were only in town for two nights and so only really had one full day to explore - this was a perfect location for our short trip. While we never got to meet Paolo in person, he was a very attentive host and made sure we were able to check-in with ease. Checking in/out was VERY efficient, faster than most hotels. In my past experiences, this has been one of the more annoying things about airbnb - not so this time! Paolo even provided us with some great suggestions for the area restaurants. I highly recommend this apartment for anyone visiting Stockholm."
2508,536283,5597068,2013-07-08,790873,Samantha,"Great apartment in a lovely part of Stockholm with plenty to do in the neighborhood. The apartment was clean comfortable. Very close to transit and the city center as well. 

We slept very well and it was the perfect little home base for our stay in Stockholm! We even had a chance to do some laundry in the building which was a great plus. "
2509,536283,5733048,2013-07-14,337095,Catherine,"While we never met Paolo in person, he was very friendly and communicative over email and text. His apartment is in a perfect location--right in the middle of all of the action in Sodermalm, but enough off the main drag to be relatively quiet on busy weekend nights when you'll inevitably have the windows open to stay cool. It is a short walk to the subway and main ferry terminals, and a pleasant walk to the Old City (Gamla Stan).

The kitchen is well equipped, and there's a grocery a block away, a movie theater, as well as many trendy, nice restaurants and shops (Sardin, Sneakersnstuff, etc.) nearby. The apartment is simple, but bright and comfortable. Paolo was kind enough to lend us olive oil for cooking and to not blink an eye when a windy evening blew over and broke his plant pot (sorry about that!). We would definitely return to Paolo's!"
2510,536283,6212079,2013-08-04,5467919,Lisandra,We  enjoyed  our stay at Paolo's. His studio is very well located and we managed to find everything we needed in the neighborhood. Thanks Paolo!
2511,536283,6308313,2013-08-07,1112420,Kars,We spent an enjoyable few days in beautiful Stockholm. Paolo's apartment was the perfect base of operations for our exploration of Södermalm's many great cafes and restaurants.
2512,536283,6751426,2013-08-24,573378,Justin,"The location and place is great.  It's easily walkable to gamla-stan and all the major downtown attractions.  The bathroom and shower are also very nice, and it has laundry facilities on the first floor which we found very helpful!  It also has wickedly fast internet.  It would be a solid 5 stars all around except the floors were quite dirty when we arrived.  Luckily we found the vacuum cleaner and cleaned them ourselves so that we could happily follow scandinavian tradition and take our shoes off at the door.  ;o)"
2513,536283,7050319,2013-09-04,7786302,Tricia,"Great location and good living space, exactly as shown in photos. Lots of conveniences nearby and Paolo was really helpful. A bit noisy late on Saturday night, but otherwise ideal. Would stay here again. "
2514,536283,7469775,2013-09-21,6889961,Darongklod (Gott),"We had such great time in Stockholm. This couldn't be perfect if without kindly and helpful of the host Paolo! He had provide us information in detail since we arrived at the airport until you can get to the apartment. His apartment is stunning with the size and decoration. The apartment is absolutely clean and smell great. Everything necessaries was provided in the room such as cooking stuffs, towels, and clean sleeping sets.

Paolo is taking very good care in detail of the tenant. For example, he put a lot of leaflets and brochures which very helpful for us people that new in town. Moreover, he has provided a huge iMac to use as well as printer, its very very convenience.

Regard to the location, we truly love the location. Just 5 mins from station. The apartment is locate in the heart of Sodermalm and also surrounded by nice shop and cafe like Acne, Marimekko, Grangpa etc. When I told to my Swedish friend about where I live, she confirmed that  ""Lucky you!, your apartment is pin in exactly right place in the moment, most cool and hip place to visit in stockholm!!""

So I really recommend Paolo place and I would definitely come back to his place again if I come to Stockholm."
2515,536283,7950804,2013-10-09,2437837,Frida,The apartment was exactly like in the pictures. Though I never met Paolo in person there was no problem in the communication and everything worked perfectly. The location of the apartment could not be better and I highly recommend Paolo's place!

The location is great, in trendy sodermalm. Very close to small food shops and two supermarkets (ica and lidl) and the metro. The kitchen was very well equipped and Paolo told us to use the tea and coffee and essentials like salt and pepper. Clean towels were provided and a hair dryer which was handy! I would use this apartment again and recommend it."
2522,536283,10887508,2014-03-11,6412648,Alexandre-Indar,"Paolo is an amazing host, and his apartment is at the very heart of what makes Sotckholm ""hip"" to my eyes.

2526,536283,13427704,2014-05-27,517167,Benjamin,"We had an amazing stay in Stockholm and Paolo's flat was just the perfect place to be! Right in the middle of the action, it's very convenient to walk around and enjoy the most of the city. On top of that, the flat is lovely and was clean and tidy! And Paolo was very helpful and responsive! 
I would definitely recommend it to anyone willing to enjoy Stockholm!"
2527,536283,13652035,2014-06-02,8512917,Gary,I just spent two nights in Paolo's apartment while I was in Stockholm to run the marathon this weekend. The place was perfect for my needs and really conveniently located. For a vibrant neighbourhood in the inner city it was very quiet and comfortable. Paolo was very helpful regarding suggestions for places to eat in the area and was always very quick to respond to any query that I had. This was my first experience of using Airbnb and I'm converted. If all of my future stays are as good as this I will be a satisfied customer.
2528,536283,14189360,2014-06-14,14948456,Sergio,"Our stay in Stockholm was great. Paolo's appartment is exactly as it is shown in airbnb. Very well equiped, particularly, the kitchen stuff. Paolo was kind and he was allways concerned about our boubts and needs. The neighborhood is wonderfull."

Paolo himself was nice, polite and helpful, easily accesible and eager to help and answer all our queries.
Recomiendo el piso de Paolo para vuestra estancia. Es cómodo y muy bien situado, a dos manzanas de una parada de metro y de varios supermercados. Paolo es muy educado y nos ayudó resolviendo todas nuestras dudas en el momento."
2530,536283,20002897,2014-09-22,15164428,Ivan & Olya,"Paolo provided us with all necessary info about the location and the apartment. That helped us to move in and reside there easily! The location is perfect, you live in the center of the Södermalm island in 4min from Tunnelbanna, 5min from Soderhalarna market, and definitely in the middle of lots of bars and restaurants around. The apartment is spacious, supplied with nice bathroom and fully equipped kitchen. There were our best two weeks in Stockholm! Great thanks Paolo, you are the best!"
2531,536283,20524178,2014-09-30,21312609,Andrée,"L’appartement était conforme à la description qui avait été faite. Il y avait tout le necessaire pour cuisiner. Le quartier est calme et proche du métro et des magasins d’alimentation. Paolo  a toujours aimablement répondu à nos questions, nous avions demandé un lit d'une personne en supplèment, ce qui a été fait. L’avantage pour nous c’est que nos petits enfants habitent le même immeuble, ce qui nous a permis d’être au plus près d’eux. Nous envisageons au printemps de refaire une demande pour cet appartement. Sincèrement rien de négatif pour cet appartement."
2532,536283,26367806,2015-02-10,1504396,J & P,Paolo's apartment is perfect for a weekend stay in Stockholm. Close to lots of nice cafes and restaurants in the heart of the Sodermalm.

2534,536283,31487744,2015-05-05,332984,Jo,"Paolo's flat was great for our 2 night break to Stockholm. In a great location, everything we needed was easily accessible by foot. 

The flat itself was very clean and tidy and felt like a home away from home. Paolo was super quick with his responses and really helpful and accommodating with his check in/check out times. Would thoroughly recommend."
2535,536283,33194086,2015-05-25,1334842,Tom,Paolo has been very helpful and flexible regarding arrival and leaving the apartment. The apartment is in a great location and has everything needed for a couple days stay. We would use it again anytime!

2539,536283,47521303,2015-09-19,22736454,Daniel,Paolo fue un gran anfitrión. Estuvimos todo el tiempo comunicados y nos hizo muy fácil llegar al departamento.  La ubicación es perfecta . Gracias Paolo!
2540,536283,48761873,2015-09-28,37883403,Mervyn,"Paolo was very responsive and replied swiftly to communications, right from my first enquiry. He provided clear instructions on how to get to the apartment, as well as detailed check-in/out information.

CHECKING IN 
This was a smooth process because the apartment block was centrally located, just a short 30–35 minutes cab ride from the airport. Paolo informed me earlier that he will not be around for the check-in but using the GlueLock app to get in was a breeze.

APARTMENT
The space was exactly as pictured/described, but a lot prettier. It seems Paolo has just completed a few new pieces of art and they were displayed in the apartment – lovely pops of colour. The kitchen was also very well stocked and Paolo generously invited me to help myself to anything I might need. 

The bed seems to be a double but it's really good for one person; it would be snug for two (as the listing suggested). But Paolo included an extra mattress in case it was necessary. While I didn't set it up, there was more than enough room to set up the extra bed. The bathroom was clean and fresh towels were provided. A small blowdryer was also provided.

LOCATION
It was my first visit to Stockholm and I have not stayed anywhere else in the city. But I cannot imagine a more central location to stay and explore the city. There is a supermarket a block away and the main Götgatan street is less than 2 minutes walk away. While it was very central, the street where Paolo's apartment is on is rather quiet. There were occasional loud conversations from the street but this was only because I left one of the windows open.

Several of the city's popular bakeries, cafes and restaurants were a short walk away – Cafe String, Pom & Flora, Bakvervet, Bagerie Petrus, Gondolen, Nook, Nytorget 6 and more. It also took me less than 30 minutes to walk to Gamla Stan.

I highly recommend Paolo's apartment if you're in the city for a few days and looking to explore the vibrant Södermalm neighbourhood on foot, and even Gamla Stan. It was in a great location and Paolo made the stay extra welcoming with his warm messages and quick replies."
2541,536283,53747507,2015-11-12,43198914,Ermes Giuseppe,Paolo è stato molto cordiale e disponibile per ogni richiesta. L’appartamento è confortevole e corrisponde alla descrizione fatta. Si trova in una ottima posizione strategica per raggiungere mezzi di trasporto e servizi. È molto silenzioso con una cucina ben attrezzata. Un sincero ringraziamento a Paolo.
2542,536283,61053146,2016-01-31,48899235,Steve,"Paolo was a very nice host who responded to our queries promptly. The apartment is at a great location, facilities are as described. We'd also like to thank Paolo for allowing us to do a late checkout. Will definitely book with Paolo again. "
2543,536283,62084629,2016-02-11,1117811,Pepe,"Paolo was very easy to communicate with and made sure that check in and check out was smooth for us even though he happened to be out of town. And his studio! Ah his studio is amazing - even better than what the photos show. Clean, well-design and situated in a great part of town. My wife and I fell in love with chilly Stockholm and Paolo's very warm apartment made it all happen!"
2544,536283,67484704,2016-03-29,55708241,Felipe,"Great host! Nice studio, really well located!!!  If you want to spend a great time in Stockholm just take this!!! Thanks for everything, Paolo."
2545,536283,74567139,2016-05-15,12614319,Sarah,"2 friends and I stayed at the apartment during Eurovision. We were concerned that it might be too small all of us in one room as we are girls. But it was great. Even with 3 beds (very comfortable all of them) all our suitcases and stuff! Very Spacious
It was in a great area with bars, restaurants and supermarkets close. Loads to do in walking distance with great transport links. 
Paolo was great, we were arriving late and he arranged for someone to be waiting for us with the keys, even though the flight was delayed as well. 
I would definitely stay again when I return to Stockholm
Thanks for a great stay and letting us use the apartment "
2546,536283,79651423,2016-06-13,9273069,Wilson,"The apartment is exactly as it was listed. Perfect for my friend and I. It was clean, great location and quite spacious. We had an awesome stay at Paolo's place. "

2548,536283,87820485,2016-07-22,14864444,David,"Pablo's studio is in a great location in hip Sodermalm. It is very close to the metro, great bars and nice restaurants (try the Pelikan for good Swedish food). His place was perfect for me, traveling alone. It was comfortable, clean and well-kept. Paolo is very responsive and communicating with him was easy. I would definitely stay at his place again if I come back to Stockholm. "
2549,536283,93714697,2016-08-13,26568158,Elise,"The studio apartment was in a great location close to the metro, supermarket, restaurants and bars and an easy walk into the old town. 

Apartment size was fine for 3 with 2 mattresses on the floor as the double bed was pretty small.

Paolo also left us a bottle of wine which was a lovely welcoming touch.

My only issue was the apartment was a bit dusty which isn't great for people with allergies."
2550,536283,96628165,2016-08-23,7960413,Jelena,"Paolo's apartment was just what we needed in Södermalm, it's central, the building is very authentic and the apartment is decorated in an interesting way (loved the Nyan cat paintings). In addition to that, Paolo was very easy to reach - we didn't need any help/tips but had a feeling we could get some any time. Thanks for letting us feel like a local! 

"
2551,536283,99248613,2016-09-04,36295671,Lutz,"We had a great time in Stockholm especially because of Paolos beautiful apartment. It is exactly as described, spacious and equipped with everything you need. Paolo is very responsive and was flexible regarding the time of arrival and leaving the place. The apartment is very well located for exploring Södermalm and the highlights of Stockholm. Thank you Paolo, we will come back."
2552,536283,100657188,2016-09-10,172742,Aleksey,"Paolo was very easy to contact.  His apartment is in a great location and a great size for two people. The living area gets lots of light (good during the day, maybe not so good at night if you're a light sleeper).  The kitchen area is quite new and easy to use.  The bathroom is older but quite clean.
"
2553,536283,148224597,2017-04-30,119810179,Sjams,Paolo's place is perfect for one person or a couple but me and a friend managed perfectly since the matress on the Floor was really comfortable as well. The appartement is clean and well decorated. Because of the big Windows it's very bright inside which is nice. One flaw is the fact that the windows have no curtains. Besides that the wifi is a bit slow but you shouldn't be inside too much anyways when visiting Stockholm 
2554,536283,150473590,2017-05-08,50131614,Frans,"Nice area, nice appartment. Small but comfy bed. Friendly host."
2555,536283,154782115,2017-05-26,7869595,Anastasia,"Paolo's place is perfect for a Stockholm city trip. It's very conveniently located just on the edge of Södermalm and yet on a very quiet street. A block away is a square with fantastic cafes, restaurants and boutiques, 20 min walk across the bridge will take you to the Old town. The subway is 3 min away but I didn't take it once as I could walk everywhere.
The place itself is as pictured, very bright and airy and has a lovely district view.
Sometimes choosing an area to stay in can be a hit and miss, but I would stay in exactly the same district (and side of the district) if I visit Stockholm again.
"
2556,536283,157078844,2017-06-02,12585232,George,"Palio's place couldn't have been more ideally located for my stay. Right in the heart of Sodermalm and walking distance to literally everything, Paolo's place is ideal for a stay in Stockholm whether it's your first time or if you return. Highly recommended. "
2557,536283,160622549,2017-06-15,26628690,Neil,"The dirtiest Airbnb i have ever stayed in. Shocking. Owners personal stuff everywhere, no place to pack your clothes, or to put your luggage. Cupboards fill to the brim with clothes. Fridge full of food, some of which has gone off. Very untidy kitchen with overflowing cupboards, dirty glasses, cups and cutlery. Bed made with non-ironed linen, dirty bathroom with pubic hairs everywhere, dead pot plant in window. No curtains, so continuous light. A airline eye mask next to bed, which how many people have worn? Dirty dishes in dishwasher. Empty hand soap container, ½ toilet roll. No welcome note or any brochures of the beautiful city of Stockholm. Avoid at all cost."
2558,536283,185651915,2017-08-22,12959771,Coralline,"Appartement super bien placé au coeur du quartier bobo de Stockholm et à quelques minutes du métro desservant la vieille ville et la gare centrale notamment. L appart était très propre et Paolo très réactif a nos demandes. Je recommande! Seul bémol la taille du lit, un peu petit a 2."
2559,536283,188723328,2017-08-30,5040515,Loretto & Andrew,"Paolo's apartment is perfectly located in a lively part of Sodermalm with plenty of shops, restaurants and bars within walking distance, and a metro station about a 5 minute walk away (10 if you've been walking all over Stockholm all day). You get some amount of city noise from the outside with the windows open, but the building itself is very quiet. The apartment was immaculate and provided everything we needed: a comfy bed for two and a hot shower. Groups of more than two or those wanting to cook themselves a sitdown meal everyday may find it on the minimal side. Note that the building has a tiny elevator that says it can fit three but can probably only fit one with luggage. We mostly walked the four flights up and down. Paolo was very communicative, and check in and check out went as smooth as can be."
2560,536283,190861365,2017-09-05,8582831,Pavan,"Great for One. A little tight for two. This place is super cute and the area is incredible and hip, with many boutiques, restaurants and bars. Short 15 min walk to the city center.
I would definitely highly recommend this place. The only thing I would note is that the bed is more of a twin bed than a double (by American standards). The two of us are fit but 6'1 and 5'9"" respectively. The bathroom was nice and clean. Great stay overall!"
2561,536283,192745761,2017-09-11,2815591,Romina,L'appartamento di Paolo è perfetto per visitare la città. A due passi dalla metro e nel carinissimo quartiere di Sofo a Sodermalm. Essenziale e curato. Anche se non abbiamo conosciuto Paolo di persona l'organizzazione e la disponibilità sono state ottime. Lo consiglio assolutamente! Uno degli appartamenti più carini dove sono stata con Airbnb.
2562,536283,196871424,2017-09-24,3850313,Bénédict,"Great stay in a great place, and best location. Easy communication and really well organised. Will be back!"

Paolo was a great host, very responsive, great communication and the hospitality was super."

2567,536283,266524623,2018-05-20,2392150,Aiken,"Paolo's place was perfect for us two, and it made our Stockholm visit an even better experience thanks to its location. The apt is right in the middle of Sodermalm, and is in walking distance to Gamla Stan. Very close to T-stations as well. Definitely recommended for people who prefer a more local feeling compared to a touristy feeling when visiting a new place. Paolo was very responsive as well."
2568,536283,269973300,2018-05-28,40279119,Gabriel,"Beautiful flat in a nice neighborhood, close to shops, bars and transports. Paolo is very responsive. All good!"
2569,536283,273234742,2018-06-05,89811344,Bryan,Nice space. Super convenient to the metro and within walking distance to many things. Lovely neighborhood. Nobody in the building acted weird because of our presence. I definitely recommend this space!
2570,536283,277365107,2018-06-16,116457984,Abigail,"We’re so glad we stayed at Paolo’s place in Södermalm! It’s a really cool neighborhood with a lot going on, and close to public transit to get anywhere in the city. The apartment was slick, updated, clean, roomy and had everything we needed. We saw some reviews about the bed being small, but we found it just fine! Two 6-foot+ people fit comfortably! There is a small elevator in the building, but we ended up not needing to use it. We’d stay here again in a heartbeat!"
2571,536283,286341111,2018-07-06,1429755,Peter,"Paolo's apartment is the perfect place for the solo traveler to explore Stockholm from. The apartment's space is used well and the building is safe, clean, and situated in just about the best location possible. 
You are a short walk from the Metro (Medborgarplatsen) allowing you to easily get anywhere in the city. In addition, the Fotografsika, and all of the amazing food, drink, shopping, and general awesomeness of Sodermalm are within a 15-20 minute walk. 
The space itself is quite neat, gets lots of light, and feels very Swedish in the design aesthetic. You can open the windows to hear the bustle of the street below or close them and not hear a peep. The mattress is comfortable, but worth noting that it is a single size for those traveling with a companion. 
Paolo is a great host and was always very quick to respond and worked with me to ensure I had no problems even with a very late arrival in the city. He also provided a number of great recommendations for everything from bakeries to fine dining in the neighborhood. 
Paolo's apartment is a great spot and I recommend it wholeheartedly."
2572,536283,315273767,2018-08-28,5456970,Chiara,"Siamo stati nell'appartamento di Paolo per due settimane, la casa è un piccolo mononolocale ben organizzato e molto pulito! Si trova in un'ottima la posizione: in uno dei piu bei quartieri di Stoccolma e comodo alla metro.
Paolo è un ottimo padrone di casa: è sempre stato disponibile e celere nella risposta.
Appartamento stra-consigliato!"

The place is very charming, the amenities are great (Paolo even let us try some of the delicious food he had!) and we could not have asked for a better location!
Would definitely recommend staying here when visiting the city!"

It’s actually laid out much better than in the pictures now with a dining table as well and the bed tucked in little corner. Kitchen/bathroom had everything you needed - even able to use items from the fridge. And location is perfect!
2578,536283,434692776,2019-04-08,51578270,Ross,"My girlfriend and I had a lovely stay at Paolo's apartment. Fantastic apartment, very well presented in a fantastic location, in Sodermalm. Walking distance to everything we needed and lots of bars, restaurants and shops in close proximity. Paolo's help with any issues we had was exceptional and response time to messages was almost instantaneous.  Check in and check out couldn't have been easier, with Paolo's information for these superb. The use of the computer proved very helpful to search for our plans for the day ahead. The bed was slightly small to what we are used to but didn't have a huge impact on our stay. Would stay here again and would recommend to all our friends and family. All in all a great stay!"

2581,536283,453267640,2019-05-15,4274380,Oana,"Paolo’s place is a cozy pearl in the heart of sofo, one of the best places in Södermalm. It’s stylish, it’s clean and it has everything you could possibly need, including plenty of food choices Paolo is sharing with his guests. It was easy to access this place and the communication with the host worked really well and quick. It’s the perfect place to explore Stockhom from, although with all the charming places around there is a risk you’ll never leave Södermalm."
2582,536283,461912134,2019-06-01,28856918,Tatum,"Paolo's apartment was perfect for my boyfriend and my visit to Stockholm. Located in the a great neighborhood the apartment is close to amazing restaurants and bars, public transportation and also within walking distance of many of the city's sights and attractions. We loved being able to cook meals in the apartment, as well as enjoying meals out at nearby restaurants. Definitely recommend this apartment for a solo traveler or couple!"

2586,536691,1685060,2012-07-11,904723,Kathryn,"Cecilia's flat was wonderful, particularly if you enjoy quirky art which leans towards the macabre (we do). Have never been anywhere else that had an exoskeleton/shell decorative theme. Full of character, so we were very happy and at home. Great location, interesting shops and squares very close by and a short walk to Gamla Stan. Very easy to deal with Cecilia. "
2587,536691,1805075,2012-07-26,2458445,Peter,"Great apartment- spacious, cozy, two balconies, cool artwork, cozy elevator, nice views, great location. What else to say? Highly recommended!"
2588,536691,1877464,2012-08-03,474156,Lars,"What a wonderful flat. We loved how it was decorated, and it had everything we needed to truly live like a Stockholmer. 

We didn't meet Cecilia, but she made it easy by leaving a key with the restaurant within the building. 

The closest subway station was about a 5 minute walk, and if you're hungry late at night, there's a ""Gatukok"" right outside. 

Lovely place, and much bigger than the pictures show.

Cecilia's apartment was perfect: from the wonderful comfy bed to the fully equipped kitchen and sunlit lounge. Shopping was so easy with two supermarkets, a selection of wonderful cafes, laundromat and post office literally only steps away and an eclectic collection of small boutiques were equally close. Cecilia's instructions on how to find her apartment were so clear that I had no trouble at all. Her apartment was all that it is advertised and more. "

2597,536691,5204844,2013-06-18,5167729,Mary,"Cecilia's flat seems to be one that is frequently available in Stockholm.  It was a relief being accepted by her after several others responded that they were going to be using their flats at the time we would be in Stockholm.   The rooms in this flat are spacious and light filled.  The bed was the most comfortable in our whole three week travels through Scandinavia.  The elevator was a big help in getting our luggage into and back out of the building.  The nice marble spiral staircase was not a problem when we weren't carrying heavy loads even with the apartment up 4 flights - and we are seniors.  Another convenience we appreciated was the laundry facility in the basement, though it took some guessing to figure out how to work the machines since we don't know Swedish.  Cecilia had a newly opened box of laundry detergent in the flat which was a big help once we found it.  We needed so little and didn't want to have to buy a whole box.  We also liked having recycling and trash disposal on the ground floor. The Coop grocery store nearby carried organic food selections which was important to us, and a good bakery was next door to it.  Having our breakfast and evening meal in the flat saved us lots of money.  Transportation around the city was very easy from here by subway.  All in all it was a very pleasant and convenient place to stay in Stockholm."
2598,536691,5294274,2013-06-23,6169798,Nicky,"I have just spent 5 days in Cecilia's fabulously sunny apartment! It is very conveniently located close to all the sights, there is an entrance to the closest subway station a few meters away from the front door as well as two great supermarkets, restaurants and cafes! 

Meeting up was smooth and trouble free!

I would highly recommend staying here! "
2599,536691,5422761,2013-06-29,28917,Luke,"We had a great stay in Cecilia's apartment. I have spent years in Stockholm and never seen such a great apartment before: big, central, cosy. Amazingly comfortable bed. We would love to come again."

We loved our stay in Stockholm. The apartment is a great size and is in a wonderful position - 2 mins from the nearest underground station, 1 minute from a good supermarket. The area itself is lovely and is a perfect place from which to explore Stockholm
Cecilia is a lovely host .
Would absolutely recommend this accomodation"
2605,536691,8461931,2013-11-01,8377247,Marta,"Cecilia's apartment is more than you wish for when looking for a holiday apartment! It's bright, spacious, and exquisitely decorated. The kitchen is well-equipped and (as others previously stated) the bed is very comfortable. The apartment has a perfect location - the metro station is right across the street, there are many bus stops in the area, the same for big supermarkets (Hemköp, Ica, Coop). There's also a wonderful bakery and a systembolaget really close. I highly recommend walking up the street to go to Monteliusvägen - a wonderful path which gives you an amazing view of the city. The Old Town can be reached in 15 minutes walking or 5 minutes by metro. If you're into vintage and retro, the SoFo district is really close and a few vintage shops are actually really close to Cecliia's place.
The contact with the host was really great - Cecilia helped me a lot and was really quick at responding. Everything went really smooth and I really recommend staying there!"
2606,536691,11138425,2014-03-22,1573156,Andreas,"Thank you Cecilia! It was great to spend the four nights with a ""homy"" feeling, and your swiftness in replying to emails and text messages was very helpful. I appreciated very much the stay in your flat, enjoying also the perfect location, including the little cafe, Mellqvists, just beside the entrance, where I had my breakfasts. I'd recommend this to anyone going to Stockholm!"

Though we did not meet Cecilia was super helpful with good comms throughout my stay and superb directions to get me there in the first place.

Recommend."
2609,536691,11957737,2014-04-20,5239157,Elisabeth,"The flat is gorgeous, we absolutely loved staying there. Although we didn't get to know Cecilia personally, I got the impression she is a very nice and uncomplicated person. The flat was tidy, the kitchen fully equipped and the location just perfect in the mittle of Södermalm, a district where you can find nice cafes and stores, a williamsbourgh in stockholm. A nice and friendly neighborhood, very fancy. We absolutely recommend it.
Elisabeth, Philip and Leander"
2610,536691,12687110,2014-05-08,11046342,Peter,We very much enjoyed our stay at Cecilia's flat.  It is spacious and light.  The location is also excellent with good cafes nearby and a metro station only a minute away.

Communication with Cecilia was very nice, and we could pick up and leave the key at the cafe next door. We will definitely book the apartment again if we can!"
2612,536691,13270954,2014-05-24,12956776,Elizabeth,"Charming is certainly the word for this lovely flat. Slight mix-up about which restaurant/cafe had the keys (there are two, one on either side of the front door)) but Cecilia was very quick to answer our call and we settled right in. The flat was spotless, bright and well-equipped. We enjoyed the lively neighbourhood during the day and the quiet nights; appreciated having a grocery store just across the street. Easy and interesting walk into the Old Town and to the ferry for Djurgarden and Vasa Museum.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, felt very comfortable and at home.  "
2613,536691,13504788,2014-05-29,6124386,Bruno,Very nice and big flat in a lovely neighborhood. Probably as far away you can get from Ikea in terms of decoration.
2614,536691,13968439,2014-06-09,3949241,Prashant,"This apartment was perfect and Cecilia is great. There was a slight mishap with keys when we got there, but Cecilia could not have been more responsive and so it was almost like nothing happened. 

The apartment is as advertised - gorgeous, spacious, comfortable and super clean (she really gets it professionally cleaned before each guest visit). Super close to the metro so that was nice. I am sensitive to noise, so even though the apartment is close to some good nightlife, it is super quiet. I'd stay here again if I come back to Stockholm."
2615,536691,14283308,2014-06-16,14978428,Maja & Andrew,"We really liked Cecilia's flat. It has lots of character, everything you need and a very comfortable bed. It's bright and friendly and very well placed for visiting Stockholm. We used the City Bikes and there is a drop off point 200 metres from the flat. The walk into town along the 'Monteliusvägen' is really beautiful, especially at sunset. 
We found communication with Cecilia friendly but rather slow-going and there was big mix up when we arrived and the key was not in the bistro where it should have been so we could not get into the flat. This turned out not to have been Cecilia's fault but it still left us having to find different accomodation at 10pm. The next day this was all cleared up and Cecilia reimbursed us promptly. Despite this mishap we would happily return to Cecilia's flat."
2616,536691,15832692,2014-07-16,13661632,Pia,We had a very good time in Cecilia's flat. The area is very nice and perfect to walk next to the water into town. The communication with Cecilia was friendly and uncomplicated. 
2617,536691,16604099,2014-07-30,3383342,Ingrid,"We liked the apartment and the neighborhood very much.  We were in Stockholm during an unusual heatwave, and had to leave the  windows open at all times.  This made the apartment a bit noisy  at night,  but it is quiet when the doors and windows were closed.   It is in a terrific  location  for  going anywhere in a Stockholm -  the subway stop Mariatorget  is a block away, buses on Hornsgatan, and a great neighborhood to walk around in.  Nicely furnished and very spacious.  The kitchen was very well equipped.  I really liked the art.  The fact that there were two balconies was terrific.  Communication with Cecilia was good..  We would gladly  stay there again.  "
2618,536691,17818181,2014-08-18,13502034,Patricia,"Cecilia made arrangements for us to pick up the keys to her apartment at a nearby cafe. Once we had the keys and the code to the downstairs door, we were happily ensconced in Cecilia's truly beautiful Stockholm apartment.  It is very large, with a living room, bedroom, and eat-in kitchen, plus TWO balconies. Unlike many apartments that we have rented, this one was obviously not simply an investment rent-a-place, but her very own apartment. We felt like we were friends who had made arrangements to use her place while she was out of town.  This intimacy had some distinct advantages. The kitchen, for instance, was fully equipped and set up because Cecilia, who we would guess is an excellent cook, had cooked there recently herself. It was a pleasure to prepare meals there and eat at the little kitchen table. The art on the walls and the various objets de art throughout the apartment always provided visual entertainment and often food for thought. The apartment was very clean and, well, charming. The only drawback was that there was not a lot of space for us to stow our own stuff, but we quickly figured out that minor problem and enjoyed ourselves in this sophisticated and beautiful space.

The location was also very satisfying.  Located on one of the main drags in Soderholm, filled with cafes and small shops, the apartment was an interesting fifteen to twenty minute stroll to the Gamla Stan, Stockhplm's old town. There were grocery stores within a half a block, subway stations five to ten minutes walk, and the one of the City Bike stands was only a few blocks away. I should also mention that although the flat is on the fifth floor, there is a dependable lift.  

If you a re visiting Stockholm and get a chance to rent this apartment, don't hesitate."

The appartment was large and well equipped an full of light!

The most important for us was the situation. Sodermalm is a wonderfull ''quartier'': walking distance from the center, metro and market at 100 M. So much things to see  nearby!

We recommand this apparment!

We never met Cecilia but she provided us all the necessary information.
The neighbourhood is a little noisy at night. The appartment was clean and comfortable, especially the kitchen.
We recommend this accomodation if you want to experiment the Stockholm people life!"

Area Sodermalm is a great place near the center of Stockholm.
If we will have a trip to Sweden we wish to stay here again."

Although I didn't have the pleasure to meet her personally, she was always present, answering my question in a quick and positive way! I do recommend her place. The flat was clean and full furnished. Perfect location, close to bars, cafes and nice restaurants! Cool area full of parks and close to anything we really needed! Would stay again in her nice flat! "

Lejligheden ligger meget centralt og tæt på vandet, med meget hyggelige omgivelser, cafeer, indkøb, busser, etc.
En meget personlig og spændende lejlighed med dejlige altaner."

It doesn't feel cluttered at all just well-curated and thoughtfully chosen. By the end of our stay, I wanted to sit down and ask Cecilia about her travels and interests. I love light and air and the two balconies - one of the kitchen and one of the dining area - were perfect. Everything is clean and well-organized. Communication with Cecilia was quick and easy. The flat is in a great location with tube stop, grocery stores, an excellent cafe, and a vegetarian restaurant steps away. It was also easy access to Slussen and Gamla Stan. Would love to come back!"

2632,536691,41922592,2015-08-10,16591965,Sharon,"Cecelia's place was clean and had many eclectic artsy decor.  There's two charming balcony located in the kitchen area and the formal dining room.  Her place is conveniently located in the Sodermalm area which is around 10-15 minute walk to Gamla Stan and Central Station.  There are many great little cafes, restaurants, and hipster type of bars close to Cecelia's place.  With the windows open at night the place had a nice breeze therefore we were always comfortable and had some pleasant sleep.  Her place was equipped with all the extra amenities if you desire to cook.
We usually made breakfast and had dinner out since there's too many great restaurants to pass up on.  Stockholm is a great walking city and Cecilia's flat was greatly enjoyable.
The only recommendation is to squat while you shower since there's no shower curtain and the water will splatter everywhere making it rather messy and wet in the bathroom. Other than that it's a wonderful flat with the best possible location."

The flat itself  is unique and charismatic and as we were there over new year I can attest to how cosy and warm it is!
Cecilia was a wonderful host who communicated quickly and clearly meaning that there was never any confusion.

Nous n'avons pas eu la chance de la rencontrer mais elle s'est montrée très flexible au niveau de l'arrivée (23 heures) et a été tres réactive au téléphone.
Son appartement  est tres bien situé, le quartier est agréable, le metro est à 5 mn à pied mais nous avons pu visité toute la ville sans prendre les transports.
La décoration de l'appartement est trés personnel, c'est intéressant et loin du standard triste des chambre d'hotel
l'appartement est tres bien chauffé (important s'il fait -4 dehors) et j'ai rarement dormi dans un lit aussi moelleux !!
un vrai cocoon!!

The location is fantastic,  in the cool Sodermalm area, and within easy reach of the main sights of Stockholm, with excellent  public transport connections. Handover was very smooth. We would highly recommend this apartment."

The flat and the location were incredible - the flat is spacious with little balconies front and back to get the sun at any time of day - and it's within walking distance of Gamla Stan though the metro is so close and so good you don't need to worry about walking. We had a great time and would certainly go back there.
2642,536691,85231962,2016-07-10,5169277,Helen,"We enjoyed our stay in this art filled apartment. The apartment was very roomy. The location was great, close to the metro and in the trendy Solderman. Lots of shops and cafes close by."

2646,536691,100001004,2016-09-06,25395022,Eline,"We really enjoyed our stay at Cecilia's apartment. It looks just like in the pictures: spacious and full of art. The apartment lies in a nice neighborhood. Very close to the metro, a big supermarket on the corner of the street, and a very good cafe (Kaffeebar) next door. Although we didn't meet Cecilia in person, communication was good and we could pick up the keys in the restaurant next door. 
The only impractical thing is that there is no shower curtain in the bathroom, so the bathroom was full of water after showering."
2647,536691,124920420,2017-01-03,1199821,Jana,"The apartment was really spacious and nice. Just as described. 

Perfectly situated in order to explore either Söder and the rest of the city.

Restaurants, shops and subway are just a few steps away.

The flat is on the 5th floor, but has an elevator, so even with luggage, it's no problem.

We didn't meet Cecilia personally, but the conversation was really good and the check in and out perfectly organised.

So it's a really nice place to stay which we can definitely recommend."
2648,536691,143036083,2017-04-10,38640180,Barbara,"The apartment has a very personal touch.

We had a fantastic stay in her apartment with subway, busstops, coffee shop and supermarket just next door. "

It was close to a metro station and supermarket, which was very convenient. The apartment was super quirky, with lots of different artworks and eccentric furniture. Cecilia communicated with us clearly through air bnb with regards to checking in and out. The only recommendation I would have is to include a shower curtain as water would go everywhere when taking a shower. Overall, a very enjoyable stay in Stockholm! "
2651,536691,169583165,2017-07-13,2646555,Amanda,"Cecilia's apartment is great - the bed is super comfy (always important); the water pressure is great in the shower, the kitchen is equipped (though the knives are a little dull, but other than that, you'll find what you need for basic cooking). It's super close to the subway, great coffee shops, multiple grocery stores, bars and restaurants. It's really an excellent value for the money. I highly recommend staying here!

It is centrally located with a lot of nice shops, coffeebars and restaurants in the neighbourhood. There is a metrostation nearby, but we did everything by foot or by bike (best to make a reservation if you want to rent bikes)."

The apartment is nice, comfortable and well equipped, and connections to Stockholm central station and main attractions are excellent. Martin is the kindest and most helpful host you can imagine, and it was a real pleasure to meet him in person.  Also, as he wasn't there when we arrived, he arranged for a friend of his and her husband to meet  us at the station, and they too were very nice and helpful. It was a great stay, and I would definitely try and book the place again if I go back to Stockholm.
"
2676,541875,2217366,2012-09-06,3317379,Miriam,"I can surely recommend Martin’s apartment! Me and my friend have had a really pleasant stay there,  the studio flat is very comfortable, cosy and clean. It’s conveniently located, not just for the metro stop and the beautiful shopping centre in the neighbourhood, but also to get to Gamla Stan or the wonderful area of Djurgården, we just had a really nice walk. Moreover Martin is willing, exquisitely polite and kind: a really good host. If I will come back in Stockholm I’d like to come back here!"
2677,541875,2339296,2012-09-18,3118242,Deanne,Martin was an awesome host.  He met us at the train station and showed us how to get to the apartment.  He also showed us some of the best places to visit and marked them on the map for us.  Being vegan he was also able to show us a good place to have dinner.  The apartment was very quiet and in a nice part of town with easy access to the metro station.  Definitely a great stay!
2678,541875,2409787,2012-09-25,3338238,Veronica,"I moved in Stockholm in August 2012, and my parents come from France to visit me very often. Then I need a nice little flat closed to my home for them. I found it : it is Martin's flat. Very well located near Karlaplan, closed to all facilities, metro, buses and shops. There was every thing my parents needed  : food, cleaning products, touristic brochures, etc..."
2679,541875,5972791,2013-07-24,7328235,Miguel,"Martin was a great host and made sure we were comfortable while we stayed at his flat. He picked us up at our arrival, took us to his place and made sure we had everything we needed (transportation tickets, took us to the nearest supermarket...). He checked back on us after a couple of days to see if everything was going alright. His flat was nice, tidy, clean and had a good location. The only but would be that the bed was quite soft and a bit unconfortable. Nonetheless, I highly recommend staying at Martin's!"
2680,541875,6119851,2013-07-30,7376441,Jay,"This is a very quaint apartment. We felt very much at home here. So much so that my friend and I kept referring to it as ""our apartment."" The neighborhood of Karlaplan is very lovely, and there is a mall and parks within two blocks that have everything we could possibly need. It's a short walk from the garden, museums, metro, and the amusement park. Martin was a really great host. He was out of town in Berlin but it felt like he was around the corner with every question I had. He kept in touch throughout our stay and ensured that we had a wonderful time in Stockholm. "
2681,541875,6229776,2013-08-04,7575029,David,"Through out the entire process of working with Martin distantly, he was courteous, polite, and rapidly responsive with every single email communication we had.  My daughter and her boyfriend were met by Martin's kind and polite representative in Stockholm at the agreed upon time (which we had to change at the last minute, yet Martin was totally flexible in accommodating us).  Helene guided them to the apartment and shared some nice tips about the neighborhood (e.g. a local jazz club was within walking distance). The apartment was perfect, clean, functional, and in one of the most desirable perfect Stockholm neighborhoods!  We can highly recommend anyone who is interest in staying in the center of Stockholm to contact Martin.  My words hardly express my thanks for all his help and support.  "
2682,541875,6659729,2013-08-20,1894423,Peter,"I spent five days at Martin's appartment in Stockholm in mid August 2013. I chose it because the price was reasonable, the location was ideal (I was attending a conference at the Swedish Film Institute which is close by), and because the pictures made it look homey an d comfortable. I was not disappointed! Martin was a responsive correspondent, and a charming host, even when I arrived after midnight due to a delayed flight. The flat is exactly what it seems to be: I found the bed very comfortable, and everything worked perfectly. The street outside is very quiet. I didn't get much chance to visit Stockholm, but when I did walk into town for a reception, it only took me 15 minutes. There are several restaurants/cafés within a block or two, plus a 7-11 and there is also a big mall (which I did not investigate). This would be an ideal pied-a-terre for one or two people who want to visit the city, but retreat somewhere quieter in the evening. I would not hesitate to book it again."
2683,541875,6822591,2013-08-26,2878768,Noelle,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at Martin's lovely studio. The apartment is very well appointed; Martin set out bathrobes for us, a fruit basket, and had many interesting books, records, and movies to entertain. The apartment itself was impeccably clean, with a very comfortable bed.

The apartment itself is well located, close to many lovely parks, and is within walking distance to the old city and all the attractions. 

Martin was also incredibly friendly and kind. Our flight did not get in until very late at night and Martin waited for us until well after midnight. Martin was easily reachable, gave excellent directions to and from the apartment, and was very kind and communicative - a wonderful host.

This is a great option for staying in a very expensive city. We loved our stay here, and would highly recommend it. "
2684,541875,6997179,2013-09-02,8101079,Susanne,the small studio was very clean and had all what we needed for the 5 days we stayed (Website hidden by Airbnb) is very well situated and  close to Metro and bus lines. Martin was very kind and waited for us at the main train station and brought us to his flat. By drinking coffee with him he gave us some good tips for stockholm.I can definitely recommend him and would go there for another time.

Although I sent my inquiry very late (a day before), Martin was quick with answering. He was very polite and accommodating, giving me all kind of details on what I did not need to bring (hair dryer, etc.). He even met up with me at the subway station to take me to the flat.

The flat is perfectly located, nearby green areas for jogging and 5-10 minutes walking distance from downtown. It is a small, but perfectly equipped flat. 

Martin had left a fruit and chocolate basket as well as a bathrobe. Very considerate!!

If available, I will rent his flat next time as well!!"
2687,541875,15076863,2014-07-01,2126576,Jared,"I booked Martin's apartment with less than a day's notice and he was very accommodating and even provided someone to pick me up at the station and bring me back to the flat; however, a major issue arose and Martin's handling of the situation was at first, understanding, but then quickly turned immature and unreasonable. After the second evening I found BED BUGS. I had a simple itch after my first night, but I attributed it to maybe a food allergy because I ate a lot of fish. After the second evening the bites were all over my arms and body and I stayed at a friend's apartment. I returned to Martin's flat in the morning and found, in the sheets, a dead bed bug. I immediately called and texted Martin and sent him photos of the dead bed bug and the 70+ bites on my body. I left the dead bug in his flat for evidence. He called an apologized and stated this never happened before and I understand that things happen. We discussed potential solutions and he seemed open to talk; however, after I requested a refund he denied it and acted immature and kept saying that I brought the bugs and there are no bugs in his place. He also stated that it was inconvenient for his friend to pick up the keys at my hotel. Really? I'm sure that is WAY more inconvenient than having your body eaten alive by bed bugs. My stay in Stockholm was completely compromised and miserable and I had to spend an extra amount of money to stay in a hotel, cover my medical costs, and do laundry. I was sleeping most of the time due to the antihistamines and when I was awake I was constantly fighting the urge to itch my entire body. I have disputed the charge on my American Express and have asked them to step in. Martin has good reviews and I understand things happen, but I judge a host on how they handle a bad situation and Martin failed miserably with this issue. This should have been a very simple thing to refund my money and call it a day, but he denied by saying it's not his fault and I'm the one who brought the bugs. I would NOT recommend staying in his flat. You can stay at the Elite Hotel Stockholm which is downtown, provides a free breakfast and is only about $30 or so more expensive than Martin's apartment that has paint peeling off the walls and, during my stay, was infested with bed bugs. Rent at your own risk. My stay was June 25th to the 30th for 5 nights, but I left after the second night due to the bugs."
2688,541875,15203084,2014-07-04,17424932,Isin,"Martin was a great host! On short notice, he helped me out when my parents came visiting. He met us at Karlaplan and took us to the flat and had prepared with coffee and biscuits. The flat was very clean and tidy and there was even two bathrobes. My dad said it was the most comfortable bed he ever slept in. If I need a place again, I know who to contact. Thanks a lot Martin!"
2689,541875,15506024,2014-07-10,16973433,Ke,"Thank you so much Martin.
Martin was away and left his whole studio to myself.  He arranged a friend to pick me up from the station and showed me around.  We communicated through email and tried to help me in anyway he could.
The location is perfect. The local train station and bus station is just a footstep away.  Two train stops and you’re at the Old Town (5 min).  The local café serves great food.
Again, thank you very much Martin.

2690,541875,20918129,2014-10-07,20007808,Svenni,"Great apartment with everything you need for a weekend trip to Stockholm. Eventhough Martin wasnt there, a very nice friend of him picked us up at the central station and showed us everything we needed to feel comfortable (thank you MALIN :)).
The apartment is located very central, we did everything by feet, exhausting, but it worked very well!
I would choose that apartment again for sure!"
2691,541875,21886199,2014-10-26,21171339,Jan,"I had a very pleasant stay at Martins place. It was located very near the metro so Stockholm is easy reachable. The appartment was well described. Fresh towels, soap present. Martin received me from the metrostation and showed me around the neigbourhood. "
2692,541875,23464494,2014-12-01,19421935,Rannveig,"Vi hadde en veldig fin helg i Stockholm i Martins leilighet! Vi fikk gode instrukser på hvordan å komme seg fra flyplassen, og ble møtt av en venn av Martin (Martin var ikke i byen) som viste oss til døren. Leiligheten var ryddig og fin, og lå også rett i nærheten av T-bane og dagligvarebutikker. Vi vil absolutt anbefale denne leiligheten, og kan godt tenke oss å bo her igjen ved en seinere annledning! "
2693,541875,38744864,2015-07-18,8469809,Clément,"Martin was a great host. He explained us everything to come to the flat. I had the pleasure to meet him and we had a drink together talking about lot of things. It was really nice. The flat is very nice, in a calm suburb, and close to the subway. I recommend it greatly !"
2694,541875,40403788,2015-07-30,20177167,Nishtha,"Martin's place was perfect our stay in Stockholm. It's a small place but perfect as we didn't spend much time in the apartment. We were in a great location, central to everything and an easy walk to Gamla Stan, the centre of town and the Vasa Museum. Martin's friend Julia was there to greet us at the station and show us up to the apartment. She also gave us a nice introduction to the area. The bed was small for 2 people to sleep side by side but there was another mattress which we made room for on the floor by moving the coffee table aside. Martin was available to contact at anytime and was a generous host with fruit, chocolate and fresh towels available for us on arrival."
2695,541875,44568993,2015-08-27,40556786,Bella,"Nice and cozy apartment. Very close to the Metro station and walking distance to the center.

2697,541875,306253611,2018-08-12,2589566,Elin,"Great location. So easy to get downtown. It took about 15 minutes to walk or about 2 stops on the train which is right outside of the apartment. For being so close to downtown it was surprisingly quiet. Martin was a great host. Accommodating and easy to contact. Oh, don’t forget to go to the Valhalla bakery. It’s about a 5 minute walk and oh so delicious!"
2698,541875,309998987,2018-08-19,67684029,Ieva,"I had a wonderful stay at Martin's place. He was not in town, but every communication was very efficient, he replied within a few minutes. The check-in and checking-out was flexible and smooth. His friend let me in and showed around the place. It is a cosy and clean apartment that has everything you could possibly need. On top of everything I was allowed to used Martin's bike, which was very convenient to get to the university. Apart from that, the place is just a minute from the metro station, and actually in a walking distance from the centre if you don't mind 15 min walks. Next time I'm in Stockholm, I know where to stay for sure :) Thank you, Martin!"
2699,541875,316451434,2018-08-31,7172798,Miranda,"I had a lovely stay at Martin's place; it was cozy but had all the amenities I needed and was in a perfect location, only about a 1-minute walk from the nearest subway station (and about a 20-25 minute walk from Stockholm's museum hub). Martin was a great host - though he wasn't in town at the time of my visit, he communicated perfectly and had his uncle meet me when when I arrived to show me around the space. Even when I accidentally locked myself out of the apartment, Martin and his uncle were so understanding. I especially appreciated that the kitchen was stocked with essential cooking items (including tea!), which Martin let me use. Thank you, Martin!"

Martin was a really nice host, and his uncle, who showed me the place, was very friendly and helpful. Communication was quick and easy. The location is very quiet, and the flat has everything you need, including utensils, spices, tea and so on. I had a great stay and would definitely come back!"

He received us when we arrived in Stockholm and showed us around the apartment, provided towels and bed linen as well as some nice bubbly wine to welcome us! He was also available via phone during our stay and gave us some tips for the Hornstull area. His flat is very central and close to the subway, the area has a lot of restaurants and is close to various shops. The flat has a really original and scandinavian style, we liked it so much! I would strongly recommend Anton and his flat for a Stockholm stay. :)  Thanks so much for having us!"

Anton var enormt sød til at tage imod os og super tjekket. Der var så rent og blomster overalt da vi kom samt en flaske champagne - ren luksus. Nabolaget var virkelig fedt og meget tæt på metroen samt indkøbsmuligheder og masser gode restauranter og butikker!!
Sindssygt dejlig og hyggelig lejlighed og KLART anbefalelsesværdigt..

He has welcomed us in his apartment after our flights with a bottle of wine! The apartment is nice, clean and really beautiful, we were four people and it was perfect.

I did not stay in the flat myself but visited them throughout the weekend. The flat is spacious enough to host three people easily, but could probably host up to five people without any problem.

It looked like described as in the pictures and it is really central. Just across the street you find a metro station which is in the city centre in minutes.

My friends and I would totally recommend to stay in this apartment in Stockholm! It even would fit more than 4 people easily."

Just a very stylish stay with every corner and detail like those interior design magazines! The trip definitely was made better because of the apartment :D"
2758,556363,62525390,2016-02-15,37579201,Alice,"Beautiful apartment, nice and spacious. There were six of us and we fitted in just fine! Lennard was very friendly and helpful - I would recommend this apartment in a heartbeat!"
2759,556363,64295391,2016-03-02,55308843,Didier,"Très bon accueil de Lennard qui nous a très vite dit de nous sentir comme chez nous. L'appartement est très fidèle aux photos du site internet et le volume de la salle à manger/cuisine communiquant avec celui du salon est très agréable. L'exposition est excellente et permet de prendre son petit déjeuner en plein soleil. La localisation de l'appartement avec le métro S:T Eriksplan au pied de l'immeuble nous a permis de rayonner dans toute la ville avec une bonne partie à pieds (compter 30 minutes pour rejoindre Gamlastan à pieds). Bref, un super appart' pour un super séjour !"
2760,556363,64607103,2016-03-06,31588200,Aaron,"The appartment was spacious and clean.
Our stay was only 4 days but very nice.
We didnt met lennard but he always wrote back quick. So it was very uncomplicated for us.
I can recommend it to everyone!"
2761,556363,65259777,2016-03-12,24338559,Jiangrui,"Good apartment, good view, good landlord and good experience."
2762,556363,73985115,2016-05-12,55140212,Elliot,"Host was present when we arrived and welcomed us well, showed us around the flat, which was really nice and as advertised. Told us a few things about the flat that we should know, which was helpful and then left us to our own devices to enjoy the place. Was easily contactable and helpful when negotiating check-out times etc. Flat itself was great, very open, good location being next to a Metro station, clean and with some great views of the city. Would definitely recommend!"
2763,556363,75580256,2016-05-22,3139804,Alexander,"A nice and clean apartment. It is very well located in Stockholm. Right in front of the apartment, there is a metro station. I can really recommend to stay here."
2764,556363,76488564,2016-05-27,39536836,Myriam,"Very nice and spaceful appartement.  A lot of natural light.
Well located.
We enjoyed our stay, I recommend this place if you go to Stockholm! "
2765,556363,77109606,2016-05-30,22128507,Ofebia,"Wonderful Appartement! Very comfortable bed. Host was very helpful when we needed help, though we did not meet him."
2766,556363,82767549,2016-06-29,33085855,Tom,Lennard was very helpful and made it easy for us to settle in. His place is very nice. A bit tight for 5 people with a lot of backpacking gear. But that's our issue not his. It's spacious and clean with a nice high rise view. Would recommend for a visit to Stockholm. It's also very central and easy to reach places from. 
2767,556363,83899895,2016-07-04,40272588,Maija,"The apartment was as beautiful as in the pictures! The location was great, Vasastan is a really lovely neighbourhood with many nice restaurants and cafés. Lennard was really easy to contact with and everything went smoothly! I do warmly recommend this apartment."
2768,556363,85611584,2016-07-12,54856246,Nicole,"Die Wohnung ist sehr gut gelegen und gemütlich eingerichtet. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt. Es hat alles wunderbar geklappt, leider haben wir Lennard nicht persönlich kennen gelernt. "
2769,556363,86253755,2016-07-15,11449862,Bruce,Lovely apartment in a great location. Easy access to the metro station and loads of coffee shops and restaurants within walking distance.  The apartment is spacious and pretty unique.
2770,556363,87138634,2016-07-18,78661737,Aurelie,We had a very pleasant stay at Lennard's flat! The location was perfect as it is close to the metro and the bus. We were comfortable as five people in the apartment but six could be tricky because the cot was unstable. The apartment is beautiful with a lot of light. We would recommend staying here for sure!
2771,556363,91380472,2016-08-05,37777702,Marie,"The apartment is in a great location and easy to get to from the airport by bus. There are 2 bedrooms, one with a large double bed and another one with 2 single beds. As we were 6, one of us had to sleep on the couch which was OK because we were only there for a few days but the apartment was really small for 6. The apartment was really lovely, but there wasn't any storage for clothes. 
There is plenty of restaurants and bars  down the building, and the subway is in front of the apartment. 
However some parts of the apartment were dirty (hoven and dust below beds). 
Perfect for 4 people"
2772,556363,103168796,2016-09-21,83753434,Florin,everything was great

"
2777,556363,163352102,2017-06-24,5451855,Heidi J,Lovely window views. Fantastic neighborhood. Subway literally across the street. Fully equipped kitchen. 
2778,556363,165528984,2017-07-01,6415239,Justin,"Spacious apartment in a fabulous location. Very comfortable for our family of four. Great views and very well fitted out with everything you might need. An excellent place to stay in Vasastan, Stockholm. "
2779,556363,195533787,2017-09-19,1185553,Dana,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2780,556363,199882732,2017-10-03,22065926,Victoria,"On the positive side, this apartment is modern, very cool and the location is absolutely perfect. It's right next to the train and you can access anywhere in Stockholm. There are plenty of great restaurants, shops etc right in the neighborhood. The pictures are accurate in terms of the interior and the great view.
On the other hand, there were challenges to our stay. Our host  gave very little communication before we arrived- even after trying to contact several times. We stayed 6 nights and would have liked to unpack. Unfortunately, all closets were duct taped shut, with only a few hangers on the backs of doors. We assumed those were for us, but had no real way of knowing because there was absolutely no note or communication about the apartment- just a key under the mat.
Lastly, the host left a pile of his dirty laundry covered by a towel in the bedroom. Again, we were there 6 nights...
If you're considering a place to stay, maybe the great location and cool interior would outweigh these challenges. All things considered, I wouldn't stay here again."
2781,556363,265781943,2018-05-18,111229449,Raimund,Lennard is a welcoming host easy to communicate. His apt is amazing and everything is close by. Top address in Stockholm.
2782,556363,319840387,2018-09-07,112231461,Viktor,Lennard is a very friendly guy. The beautiful apartment is located very good and in a calm area of Stockholm. Would definitely recommend for anyone!
2783,556363,343925289,2018-11-02,35478334,Malin,"What a gem! Stylish attic that is and feels much bigger than the photos show. The location is amazing! Metro across the street, with quick easy access anywhere in Stockholm. Super comfy beds and great kitchen! Host is great, and was helpful in every way, he even organised an Xbox for my 11 year old son! Can't recommend highly enough!"
2784,556363,409010340,2019-02-06,20284690,Eric,Lennard place is far nicer than it even appears in pictures. great location. Lennard was very responsive and went out of his way to make sure things were good. it's a great place!!
2785,556363,437006351,2019-04-14,8506688,Mario,"Lennard is on time and accurate.

His apartment is nice and close to the subway.

good restaurants in the same building."
2786,556363,455827762,2019-05-20,94204007,Moni,"In general the apartment looks like in the pictures, nevertheless there were a lot of unarranged things: the conditions of the apartment are not accurate, there are various details on the walls, the kitchen board and the bathroom (the toilet seat is broken and there was hair on the shower). The place was not cleaned properly, there was dust everywhere and the used candles were not thrown away. Also, there were dirty dishes inside the dishwasher and the cupboards were badly organised and messy.  The closets or the storage space in the bathroom are not available. 
Overall, the price mandated does not correspond with the conditions of the apartment. There was a lack of interest in giving the guests an enjoyable experience, not mentioning the fact that the host asked me if someone could enter the apartment while we were inside (I totally understand is their property, but one is paying for a service and that also includes privacy and safety). 
The apartment itself has a lot of potential to be a nice and sophisticated space but the furniture and general conditions of the apartment leave a lot to wish for. I would not recommend  this space for that amount of money."
2787,556363,459976369,2019-05-28,51143553,Tara,Convenient location with a friendly host
2788,560308,1820886,2012-07-28,2341076,Blanka,"We were very dissapointed with the appartment as it was quite filthy: floors, windows sills, tables,blankets.  Shocking was the kitchen where we have found dead worms in drawers with cutlers.  Wi-fi internet have not worked as a password was not available, but finally after reseting a modem we could at least connect via a cable. Bathroom was very simple too. In total the quality of the apparmtent does not correspond to price we paid."
2789,560308,123232268,2016-12-28,52665104,Feras,"Mats was great host and accommodating with flexible checking in and checking out
Super friendly and well communicative. "
2790,560308,136067382,2017-03-08,23514163,Martin,Everything was clean and nice. Would stay there again.
2791,560308,253896002,2018-04-15,151803690,Ronja,The apartment was super clean and everything was prepared for our stay! The communication was good. Thanks for having us and being so flexible with the check in and check out times :)
2792,560308,308347142,2018-08-16,8294108,Orit,"Light, airy, stylish apartment in a good location (not central but walkable distance from train station). Great value for families.
Thank you for a great stay."
2793,560308,345490914,2018-11-05,47196919,Leopoldo,I definitively recommend this apartment
2794,565912,6289351,2013-08-06,7670734,Frank,"We stayed in summer 2013 with our family in this beautiful house and really enjoyed it very much! The house is very comfortable and beautifully and romantic decorated. The location is perfect for visits into Stockholm (10-15min by car) and into the neighborhood. Our three young kids felt very much at home in the house and we all found it a great experience into the Swedish way of llving to have the honour to stay for almost a week in this great place.

Also the hospitality of Patrik, the owner, was very warm and supportive. 

We very much recommend this great place to many other visitors who plan a visit to the great city of Stockholm!"
2795,565912,14858803,2014-06-28,5629702,Serena,Patrik is a wonderful host. I was able to get the keys a day earlier because my family was arriving on a very early flight. Also he was helpful in explaining how to fix the internet. The only issue was I didn't know the house was 3 floors and the 2nd to 3rd floor was little steep for older people. Otherwise I has a very lovely stay and I would definitely recommend this place to friends. 
2796,565912,16894201,2014-08-04,2752208,Anna,"Patrik's house is wonderful! Beautiful and spacious, with a great view on the lake. Very relaxing after a long day of walking in the city! 
The area is very nice as well, with a grocery store just in front of the tramway station (the tramway line was being renovated during our stay, but it was very easy to take a bus instead).
We haven't met Patrik but we stayed in touch with text messages. He was very friendly and helpfull. 
I higly recommend it!!"
2797,565912,17557611,2014-08-14,15660480,Thea,"De beschrijving van het huis is correct: dit is een romantisch huis, dat zeer sfeervol is ingericht. We hebben het met veel plezier als uitvalsbasis gebruikt. Het bekijken van het centrum is heel goed te doen per fiets, met een kwartier tot een half uur fietsen ben je bij de meeste bezienswaardigheden. Vlak bij het huis bestaat de mogelijkheid te zwemmen, wat ook goed bevallen is.  Het is prettig om in de tuin te zitten, wij hebben er meermalen ontbeten. Er is een zeer goed uitgeruste keuken. Wij hebben zeer genoten van ons verblijf. "
2798,565912,35323940,2015-06-17,34028043,Jeremiah,"Patrik's house is located in the very posh part of Gröndal, as soon as we arrived at the front door my friends and I couldn't believe how beautiful the house was, with well kept flowers and plants everywhere. The pictures on airbnb don't seem to do it justice. On entering the house we knew that we were home. The house is very spacious and has so much character. Patrik was kind enough to map out where we can find the groceries, bakery and even the perfect spot for a morning jog. The four of us slept very well at night, and having 2 bathrooms meant that we never had to wait to take a shower or use the facilities. The neighbours are very friendly and helpful, they even told us how to get to the river bank which is literally 3mins walk away from the house. I cannot fault the house at all,however, our only regret was that we didn’t get the chance to meet Patrik and the family to thank them in person for allowing us to stay in their lovely house, especially when we were finding it very difficult to find accommodation on airbnb. Hats off to Patrik and family for being the PERFECT! hosts."
2799,565912,37633328,2015-07-09,18032083,Anette,"Vi havde løbende en dialog om hvordan vi kunne overtage huset, da familien Löfgren ikke var til stede, men ude at rejse. Det gik rigtig fint og vi følte os velkomne. Vi nød at bo i det charmerende hus!   "
2800,565912,39511610,2015-07-24,35685693,Jean-Francois,"We spent an oustanding week in this beutifully decorated wood house, close to the water. Buses and Tunnelbanna were bringing us pretty quickly to Stockholm downtown, so we could have recreational programs within the musems and restful evenings in the house.

"
2801,565912,41329138,2015-08-07,3905053,Ruth,"The listing accurately described the home and setting, although it was even more charming than the pictures. I felt like I was in a Carl Larsson watercolor! The house was immaculate,  beautifully decorated and the gardens were breath taking. We woke up every morning looking out over the sea. The space was more than adequate for 5 adults. Each slept comfortably with private space. The kitchen and dining area are spacious, and well stocked with cooking equipment, large oven, and a beautiful view. The neighborhood is charming and I liked the fact that we were in a quiet area, but with quick access to the city.  We were able to get to the train station with a lovely 15 minute  walk along the water or by tram. We had breakfast every morning at the local bakery at the bottom of the hill. I would travel back to Stockholm just to stay in this house again!"
2802,565912,41931899,2015-08-10,7352942,Paola,"Lovely house located in a quite neighborhood in close enough proximity to central tourist destinations.  

Host was accommodating and provided a baby cot.  House works well for small children as there are plenty of toys, stairs and outdoor space to entertain them.

2 children's playgrounds in the neighborhood and extremely well equipped kitchen for those who love to cook.  

Very nice experience overall."
2803,565912,84193314,2016-07-05,45370201,Nina,"Very beautiful and cozy house. Quiet and near the busstation. Host never met but very easy to contact and very friendly. Bakery around the corner. 
Just a perfect stay! "
2804,565912,166232316,2017-07-03,78317544,Dirk,"""When we first arrived at Patrik's home in Stockholm we felt comfortable immediately. The house was bright from the inside, clean and elegantly furnished. A perfectly equipped kitchen would've made a gourmet chef happy and the well kept garden offered different seating furniture. The striking distance to the lake made vespertine walks at the shore to an unforgettable experience. We hope that we can be your guests again in the future."""
2805,565912,168405617,2017-07-09,117097351,Michael,We loved this beautiful house.  We especially enjoyed sitting in the lovely garden and smelling the roses.  The dining room was a nice place for family meals.  Well equipped kitchen and lots of space for the family to spread out.  Louise loved the Moomintrol cups!!
2806,565912,175535735,2017-07-29,86765365,Philip,"Patrick's home is superb in itself – a wonderfully relaxing place to stay, with a beautiful garden set in a quiet, picturesque neighbourhood – while getting in to the city was quick and easy by bus and tram. Swimming in the lake nearby is exhilarating. This is a great place to stay to visit the city while still enjoying tranquility."
2807,565912,179312537,2017-08-07,101799104,Victoria,"Patrik is an exceptional host - he was incredibly responsive and helpful at all times and moreover his house is the perfect place for a Stockholm break. We went with our one year old and found the whole experience relaxing, enjoyable and idyllic. The house was near a lovely playground for our son and was the most scenic place we could have hoped for. Everything was stylish, beautifully kept and the attention to detail was excellent. We would highly recommend this house to anyone wanting a fabulous holiday in Stockholm!"
2808,565912,283071607,2018-06-29,107893037,Kamilla,"Flott hus, mye plass og fantastisk hage. Patrik svarer kjempekjapt på alle spørsmål."
2809,565912,286014068,2018-07-05,29809199,Lotta,Lovely place with good access to public transport and restaurants
2810,565912,306058009,2018-08-12,115620647,Dagmar,Patrik and his family were perfect hosts. They offered everything to make our stay enjoyable. The house is stylish cozy and very well equipped. Even our grandchildren who live in Stockholm and came to see us quite often loved the place. It is situated on a small hill with a beautiful garden and wonderful view to the water. We would like to come again. 
2811,565912,480152808,2019-07-02,21057194,Robert,Patrik's Place is warm and welcoming.  Convenient location to the Tram and connections to City.  The Gardens offer a nice respite and are quiet and calming.  Everything was accurate described and accommodating.  Excellent Host with good information and tips. Very responsive and connected.   Excellent!
2812,565912,496404432,2019-07-27,150937661,David,This is a beautiful period house and garden. If you don’t want to be out in the archipelago this place is reasonably close to the centre and I’d highly recommend it.
2813,565912,503573937,2019-08-06,117300498,Laurence,"The house is lovely - exactly as in the pictures. It's very easy to walk to the lake and the tram and train into Gamla Stan is no hassle at all, only taking about 20 - 25 minutes. Would definitely recommend if you are after a relaxing stay out of the city centre with easy access to the tourist sites."
2814,568341,420609366,2019-03-07,22034541,Ricky,Great apartment in a good location.
2815,568341,422587056,2019-03-11,171516512,Melody,Really fun tour! Carolyn was under the weather so we had Sam in her stead. Sam was personable & friendly. Knew his stuff; had a ton of fun facts along with the architecture info. Definitely recommend!
2816,568341,424376715,2019-03-16,11841709,Hannah,Highly recommended
2817,568341,427000490,2019-03-22,243755608,Andrew,"I did this tour with Sam, and he was incredibly knowledgeable! I definitely learned a lot that I wouldn’t have really known about on my own, and I’m definitely excited to share my new knowledge about the things he showed me! I’d highly recommend this tour if you want to take a couple hours to learn some funny and interesting facts."
2818,568341,428590375,2019-03-25,242752149,James Clifford,Be sure to take the tour!  It is exceptional!
2819,568341,428590528,2019-03-25,11507093,Alik,"A very interesting tour through some Capitol buildings, including the library (this one is a gem). Note: the entrance to the Senate is not included, it should be scheduled through the government agency."
2820,568341,432992050,2019-04-05,246600464,Miryam,Carolyn was very knowledgeable and knew the best way to get to places. She really took advantage of the time and I appreciated that. She also gave suggestions for the remainder of the day.
2821,568341,432992411,2019-04-05,93036139,Marianne,Very interesting information.  Helped me understand the dynamic beginnings of the city. Really enjoyed hearing bits of architectural information about each building. Carolyn demonstrated a genuine interest in her topic and the group
2822,568341,432993219,2019-04-05,243432883,Mansi,The tour is absolutely brilliant and gives you information you can't get anywhere else.  Loved it:)
2823,568341,437912394,2019-04-15,198121357,Loren,We had an amazing time with Sam. He told us great stories about DC and took us to some really cool places. Would definitely reccommend his tour!
2824,568341,440312888,2019-04-20,124156437,Kimberly,Sam was our guide today. He is very knowledgable as well as funny. I feel like this tour has been a wonderful gem and way to close out our trip to D.C. Thank you so much!
2825,568341,440313403,2019-04-20,6229011,Shannon,"This was an awesome tour! We learned more from this walking tour with Sam in two hours than we could have gotten in a whole day touring the area on our own! Sam has great stories and provides interesting background on the architecture of the area.  If you're in DC, this is not to be missed!"
2826,568341,440315806,2019-04-20,99789059,Lissa,"Was a great tour, Sam was knowledgeable about the history. Him and the people who was listening has connection."
2827,568341,445574970,2019-04-29,129176969,Nicole,This tour was a great way to see some of the great spots in DC. Sam was very knowledgeable but most importantly shared information that is interesting and not dry about the history of the area. We learned lots and the Library of Congress was our favorite- so beautiful!
2828,568341,447376741,2019-05-03,196589980,Martin,This was a wonderful experience. We were only in Washington for a short time and this enabled us to make a connection to this great city
2829,568341,451361753,2019-05-11,162132948,Cris Bien,Informative and suprising.

2831,568341,454076677,2019-05-17,29411777,Adrienne,"Shane is an excellent guide. He was personable, accommodating, knowledgable and friendly. He relayed information in an unassuming way. We were a diverse group- probably a sample of who comes to DC~ 2 surgeons, a lawyer, a couple of Georgetown grads and their family. He managed the group well and did so with aplomb."
2832,568341,455925327,2019-05-20,261710984,Eileen,It was an interesting tour !  I learnt much on some basic US history !

2834,568341,459451853,2019-05-27,6767543,Harry,Wonderful tour by a real expert brimming with passion for their hometown.

2836,568341,465918567,2019-06-08,229836629,Rob,Worth the time and the money.  We would not have known what to see without their tour.

2841,568341,521119063,2019-08-31,179250566,Abdul,I had a great tour with Sam. He’s very knowledgeable about the architecture of the places we visited. He gave us an in-depth insights of the architecture and the culture symbols. I don’t think I would’ve experienced the same with any other tour guiders.
2842,568341,529315285,2019-09-14,73340154,Allison,Sam was very friendly and personable. His knowledge from being a “museum person” really added a nice touch to the locations we visited. Unique insights with humorous touch!
2843,568341,529316811,2019-09-14,204571648,Dana,Sam was a wonderful host to guide us through the architectural wonders of Capitol Hill. He knew his history and kept the group moving efficiently. It was a fun tour and easy to walk.
2844,575371,83967627,2016-07-04,15207154,Massimo,"I am a private person, and I enjoyed the privacy given by the hosts. The room is right at the entrance of the flat, and has a private bathroom, so it is possible to go in and out feeling almost like you have you own private place.

The rest of the apartment is very cool. I have been there just two days and stayed very little at home, therefore I didn't really interact too much with the hosts. Nevertheless they seemed cool and interesting people."
2845,575371,89343609,2016-07-28,7872076,Marion,"We had a really nice stay at Tomas's house. The appartement is spacious and cosy, very well located (near from places to have a bath and Nice bar, restaurants ...). Tomas and his family are nice and welcoming. "
2846,575371,92625647,2016-08-09,80785384,Daniela,Thomas and Guru were great hosts. We had a very pleasant time and provider us with a lot of good tips. The room was very private and clean and the separation bathroom was a plus.
2847,575371,94550505,2016-08-16,49004694,David,"Das Zimmer war genau wie beschrieben, die Couch reicht allemal für 2 Personen und das eigene Bad bietet super Komfort. Tomas und seine Familie sind super freundliche Gastgeber. Uns haben sie den ein oder anderen Tipp gegeben, wir hatten aber auch unsere Ruhe und Privatsphäre. Die Lage der Wohnung ist spitze, viele Cafés in der Nähe sind gut zu Fuß zu erreichen und man ist innerhalb weniger Minuten in der Altstadt.
Alles in allem ein super Aufenthalt in Stockholm! Vielen Dank Tomas!"
2848,575371,97875257,2016-08-28,84089137,Rob,"Tomas and his family were wonderful hosts. They were so easy going and eager to help us find great things to do in Stockholm. And when one of us got sick, they even cooked us a meal and spent the evening with us! The room was a bit tight but totally private and with easy access to a private bathroom. Everything was very clean. The neighborhood full of local residents going about their business. About 15 minutes to walk to the bridge to Gamla Stan, 5 minutes to the subway, and near to a many other shopping and eating places."
2849,575371,100047564,2016-09-07,85792843,Peter,"De locatie is er goed in de levendige wijk Sodermalm. Ook de communicatie met gastheer Tomas verliep erg soepel. Hij is meedenkend en een vriendelijke gastheer. De kamer was prima, al bood het bed niet de nachtrust waarop gehoopt was. Door de metalen constructie maakte het bed erg veel lawaai met het draaien in bed. Tomas bood de nachten erna een verblijf in de kamer ernaast aan, waar een beter bed met houten lattenbodem stond. "
2850,575371,105515146,2016-10-02,95324051,Johnny,"Both Tomas and Guru made our absolutely one to remember. They welcomed us into their home with great hospitality and were full of really useful advise on what to do and where to eat.
The positioning of the bathroom though separate from the room meant that we didn't encroach on each other in anyway and the Wifi was superb !
If you are a walker you'll find all the sights are easy to reach without too much exertion though Söder station (less than 5 minutes from the apartment) is just one stop to Centrum and Arlanda Express !
The immediate area has a great vibe with plenty of scope for bar and restaurants.
We recommend Tomas and Guru as ideal hosts,
Johnny"
2851,575371,133013268,2017-02-20,55908169,Jie,"Tomas is a wonderful host I have ever seen, he is very nice and he gave us a lot of suggestions for the travel, through those suggestions you can know more about Stockholm, and I believe that you will fall in love with this city. 
The room is very clean and tidy, and it's location is close to all public transports, so you needn't worry about it. "
2852,575371,150260572,2017-05-07,123829094,Bjørn,Quiet neighbourhood close to the railway station. One train stop from central station.  Good to have our own bathroom. 
2853,575371,153593750,2017-05-21,129533317,山,The landlord is very nice and the house is very good.
2854,575371,154810223,2017-05-26,127487138,Franck,"We were welcomed. The room and the bathroom were clean. Tomas and Gurutze were accommodating for our luggages on the last day. The apartment is in a great location for exploring Stockholm by walking. No need to take public transport, except maybe the boat to Djugarden as it's original (but not an obligation, we walked back)."
2855,575371,157657250,2017-06-04,3497169,Savino,"Thomas and his wife were great hosts, kind, helpful, they gave us precious advice on places to visit.
Despite the late arrival hour (1 am), they welcomed us  and they also gave us  two public transport cards.
The room was small but comfortable, there was a bathroom just for us.
There has been a very good communication between us, we have been fine."
2856,575371,159966931,2017-06-12,2158793,Stefan,"The contact with tomas was very easy and he made arrangements to open up the door for us late in the evening. The room is very small, but if you just want to sleep somewhere its a good place. You have your own bathroom and basically dont have to do anything with the hosts"
2857,575371,164734954,2017-06-29,44941440,Aaron,Tomas is extremely friendly and welcoming. He really cares for you before and during your stay. The flat is really nice and big and the room was as described. For me and my wife the location of the flat is very convenient and the area really nice. Only thing is that the bed is not the most comfortable we've slept on. Besides that it was a great stay and would definitely recommend it. 
2858,575371,172902820,2017-07-22,5444941,Olivier,"Malgré notre horaire d'arrivée tardif - 1h du matin - nous avons été accueillis de manière très sympathique par Tomas. L'appartement est grand, la chambre meublée d'un canapé lit correct, et on est à 20 mn à pied de Gamla Stan. Un bon rapport qualité prix !"
2859,575371,181617952,2017-08-13,94218195,Elena Lina,Both Tomas and his wife were nice!! I def recommend it!!
2860,575371,191948294,2017-09-09,144807361,Sara,Appartamento a 20 minuti a piedi dal centro di Stoccolma ma comunque comodo per visitare la città. É andato tutto benissimo.. peccato per i vicini di casa che facevano rumore ma senza nessuna colpa dell'host.
2861,581243,1714869,2012-07-15,2872226,Lisa,"Edwin was a nice host. We had our first AirBnB experience at his house.
We stayed for one night.
He picked us up at the park closeby.
The room is clean and the bed comfortable.
You can enjoy the balcony in the summertime.
You can walk to the historical center, it's about a 30min walk and part of it along the harbour.
Thanks Edwin!"
2862,581243,1893384,2012-08-05,2880370,Cecilia & Jan,"Wie had a great stay at Edwin's place! He is so nice and helpful. He gave us hints about places to see and he was always happy to help us if we had any questions about the city or sights. 
His place is only two Train station from the central station and his apartment is only about 30 m away from the station. Additionally there is a small shopping mall right on the buttom of the building. So there is just anything that you need. Furthermore there is a lovely park nearby. I would highly recommend to stay at Edwin. My boyfriend and I would always come back to his place if we ever go to Stockholm again!!

Thanks again Edwin!"
2863,581243,1994043,2012-08-15,947279,Brendan,"Edwin's apartment is very clean and modern — in a perfect location for Stockholm sight seeing. There is a CityBikes rack directly outside the complex's entrance, which is built above a full shopping center. Everything from groceries to clothes to a quick meal are literally two minutes away.

I stayed at his place during the London 2012 Olympics, and while I wasn't in the apartment much I enjoyed chatting with him while watching whatever event was being televised."
2864,581243,2012083,2012-08-17,2679529,Олеся,"Эдвин необычайно приветливый и гостеприимный хозяин. встретил нас в порту, проводил до дома, все объяснил и показал. квартира поражает чистотой и аккуратностью."
2865,581243,2054774,2012-08-21,1568981,Paolo,"We had a great time in Stockolm,the apartement is well located,just 15 minutes by walk to arrive in the heart of the city, Edwin is really kind and he has helped us for any information in regard to the city and in regard to different information. The room is very kind and the house is very clean. "
2866,581243,2090134,2012-08-25,316552,Jared,"Edwin is extremely nice. He is very tidy. You can tell he is the kind of person who cleans up after himself after everything he does.

The apartment is in a great location. I walked everywhere:
* From T-Centralen 30 minutes
* To Gamla Stan 25 minutes
* To Djurgården 20 minutes.
* National musset, Modernamuseet: 20 minutes
But if you want to take the metro, the station is right outside the entrance to the apartment complex.

Edwin will meet you in Karlaplan and take you to his place if you have trouble finding it. Because it's so close to Karlaplan (I call it the circle garden), it's easy to find your way home with a map. It's like the center of Ostermalm and many streets lead straight to it.

I felt very safe. You need at least 3 keys just to get in (4 if he's not home). The neighborhood feels very safe too.

Inside is very modern and clean. Maybe this will describe it enough: When you lock the door to the bathroom, the outside handle glows red to let the outside know there is someone in there. The shower is clever and space-saving. It's made of 2 glass doors that swing open to form a box. When you're done, they swing towards the wall so there's more room. Although, I thought the bathroom was plenty spacious anyway.

There's a Fruit/vegetable stand outside along with a small street vendor that sells fast food, and a McDonald's. But if you are serious about buying groceries, Edwin will tell you where you can get them cheaper.

Don't be fooled by the street view here. That's the back part. The front, where you will most likely always come from, is very nice.

It's very quiet even though you are above a major street. At night, it is almost dead silent. And the room has a double-paned window and a blackout shade. It is annoying, however, when it rains because you can hear the loud rain droplets hit the sill. If that bothers you, bring ear plugs. I usually fall asleep very easily, and the sound kept me up.

There is a place to do laundry downstairs, but you have to get Edwin to reserve it ahead of time.

In terms of tourist advice, I didn't get much from him. So don't rely on him for the best places to eat. I didn't ask, but I doubt he's exactly the local expert I would hope for in terms of things to do either. He's Bolivian, but has been in Stockholm for many years. He'll give you a map, but that's the best information I could get from him. The places I listed above were good enough for me."
2867,581243,2307835,2012-09-17,648054,Phil,"Edwin was a very friendly host. He even washed some clothes I had inadvertently left on the bathroom floor!  His flat is immaculately clean as well. The walk to central station was a little longer than I had anticipated, but otherwise I was very happy with my stay. "
2868,581243,2363311,2012-09-21,2773987,Mary,"Edwin's place was very clean and neat!  He was very enjoyable to talk with and his apt is in a great location, close to transportation and has a grocery store/mall underneath his complex with anything you might need.  Would recommend !!"
2869,581243,2382992,2012-09-23,2452380,Magda,"I really enjoyed the stay at Edwin's apartment. It was super clean and tidy, everything what you need during your stay is provided by him. Edwin himself is also a really nice person, he came to Karlaplan to meet us and showed the way to the apartment. The area where the apartment is located is very quiet, clean and safe. Just when you get outside you can get to the metro. We visited mostly Stockholm on foot and so it was a perfect location to get to the most important places."
2870,581243,2445529,2012-09-29,3375909,Connie,I really enjoyed staying at Edwin's place in Stockholm. Edwin is friendly and his apartment is very clean. The room had a very comfortable bed and was quiet. The location is good - we walked all around Stockholm from the apartment but there is also public transport close by. I would definitely recommend staying with Edwin. 
2871,581243,2584423,2012-10-11,3746931,Barbara,"Edwin is a really nice person, the room and the toilet are very clean the location is very comfortable and well connected."
2872,581243,2593041,2012-10-12,3727392,David,"After a few AirBNB experiences in which we had entire small apartments to ourselves, we enjoyed staying with Edwin in his bright and cozy Stockholm place. He's a congenial and friendly host and was very helpful."
2873,581243,2650666,2012-10-18,813136,John,"Edwin was a great communicator and even met us at the metro stop to help us find his place. Good local knowledge, giving us some great restaurant advice & transport tips. He even lent me a laptop while mine was being repaired!

The apartment is very well located with excellent rail and bus connections, and within walking distance of central Stockholm. The apartment was absolutely spotless and the facilites were all as listed.

I definitely recommend staying with Edwin if you're coming through Stockholm!"
2874,581243,2655018,2012-10-19,3414387,Damir,Edwin is a very nice and helpful host. Outstandingly positive person. His apartment is very clean and cosy. It's nicely located as well - only 5 minutes from T-centralen using metro. I would definitely recommend it.
2875,581243,2700805,2012-10-24,3614059,Mao,"My stay at Edwin's place was absolutely comfortable. Before my trip to Stockholm, Edwin sent me an email with all the detail informations how to get the apartment from the airport. He kindly replied my emails with some questions so it was very helpful for me who was traveling to Stockholm for the first time. Edwin came to look for me at the metro station and showed me the way to the apartment. 

The apartment was very tidy and clean. The bed was very comfortable as well. It was located in the very nice area, there are many shops and supermarkets open until late in the evening. I highly recommend Edwin's apartment;)"
2876,581243,2793755,2012-11-03,3858793,Francisco,"Edwin's flat is even more lovely and cute that pictures show. The room is quite spacious and the bed really comfortable for two persons. It is also well communicated by public transport (in fact, the metro station is in front of the flat) and very close to the downtown (5 minutes walk). Every room of the flat is absolutely clean and the kitchen is amazing, you can use any tool or device you want. 

Edwin is really kind and helpful as well. He gave us good information about the city, museums, transportation... He speaks Swedish, English, Spanish and Russian. He let you feel utterly free inside the flat. 

Very good experience. Don't hesitate to be hosted by Edwin!"
2877,581243,2891352,2012-11-15,3173583,Christian,"Edwin is a very friendly host. The room and bathroom are spotless and very clean and comfortable. I was attending a conference in Stockholm, and I found Edwin's room much better and cheaper than staying in a hotel. I have no hesitation to recommend this place to anybody. Enjoy!"
2878,581243,2917595,2012-11-19,3855308,Jerome,"Edwin is really nice and available. He waited for us even if it was late as our flight had a delay. The flat is well located, very nice and clean. Edwin shared with us all the flat, we really felt comfortable. 
We totally recommand his flat for a week-end in stockholm!"

Edwin is a great host, very kind and helpful with getting around Stockholm.  This will be my top choice when I return."
2880,581243,3086716,2012-12-14,3365041,Indranil,"Edwin was very helpful and accommodating. My flight from Copenhagen was cancelled and I effectively landed at 1 AM at Stockholm right after a major snow storm. He stayed awake and guided me to his apartment. All the days of stay there was very pleasant. The location is very convenient, right across the street from the Metro station and above a mall (which had a few eating places and a grocery) !! All in all, am very pleased with the stay and Edwin is a great person !!"
2881,581243,3113707,2012-12-18,3277246,Francesca,"Edwin è stato molto gentile e disponibile! La stanza è abbastanza centrale, silenziosa e pulita così come bagno (in comune) e gli altri spazi! E poi Stoccolma sotto Natale è magica!"

Large bathroom, kitchen and absolutely everything you need. Very central location. Even thou I only spend there one night it was really good one. Definitely would suggest this apartment to everyone."

The apartment is very clean and perfectly located - 1 minute from the subway station and within the walking distance to the majority of the sightseeing spots. Edwin is a great host. He is very friendly and helpful, speaks several languages fluently. We would definitely recommend his apartment to stay at. When we are in Stockholm next time, we will stay there for sure. "
2886,581243,3419570,2013-01-27,1993227,Dmitriy,"Edwin provide very clean room with all we need. Shower, kitchen include and vary comfortable. Free wifi with hi speed connection - nice bonus.
You can come in and out at any time - big deal if you want walk at night.
Edwin has good skill of Russian language. He advised good cafe and interesting musems. "

2888,581243,3518390,2013-02-11,4846002,Jervis,Our stay at Edwin's was far more enjoyable and pleasant than any other chain business hotels we've ever been to in Europe!

2891,581243,3649461,2013-02-27,5084887,Andreas,"My brother and I stayed at Edwin's apartment for one night and had a great stay. Edwin is very nice and super helpful! I needed to go to the US Embassy and he right away whipped out a big map giving me multiple options as to how to get there, and told us about things to see and opening hours of the mall downstairs. Great location and great host! Would definitely stay there again and highly recommend! :)"
2892,581243,3777497,2013-03-13,3583025,Laurence,"Nice homely apartment!

No problem finding the place. It's the building connected to the pedestrians' overhead bridge. 

Just follow Edwin's instructions and you won't get lost :)

Edwin was very hospitable and we had no problem communicating. 

Convenience store is just at the ground floor of the same building!

The room was nice and warm. No problem with shower heating.

Flexible check-out time.

I highly recommend Edwin as your host!"
2893,581243,3835845,2013-03-19,5091750,Sayaka,"Edwin is so kind and the apartment is really clean and beautiful!!
I stayed there for 5 days.
He has some shops, supermarkets and post office below of the apartment.
The subway station is very close.
So, It's really convenient.
It was the first trip to Sweden for me.
I was bit nervous before I go.
When I got the apartment around 10 in the evening,
I couldn't enter it, However Edwin found me and took me to the room.
I also wanted to go to the small village where it takes 3 hours by train from Stockholm.
He booked the train ticket to there.
When I had a question, He always opened mind and answered it.
I didn't have any trouble in Sweden.
It was because of him.
I am very thankful to him. 
If my friends want to go to Stockholm, I'll recommend them to stay his house.
I also want to go back to Sweden and his apartment.
"
2894,581243,3854875,2013-03-21,5035538,Paula,"This is my second experience with Airbnb, and Edwin could have not been a better host. He was always extremely eager to help. He speaks 4 languages fluently, and we really had a great time chatting with him. He also made excellent recommendations on what to sight see and also where to eat. 
The pictures do not really do justice to the apartment. It is much better than what appears on them. It has a lot of light and it is, one of the most important items for me at least, really really clean.
We recommend staying at Edwin's and we will do it when we go back to Stockholm for sure.
Thanks for the really nice stay, Edwin!"
2895,581243,3866796,2013-03-22,1636288,Nadine,"I booked only  5hours before arriving and Edwin answered very quickly. He was very helpfull with Sightseeing Tipps and his Appartement very clean. I liked to stay at Edwin!

2898,581243,4050469,2013-04-06,4842282,Bethany,"Edwin is a kind and generous host.  My friend and I stayed for six nights and Edwin greeted us at the door with a ""make yourself at home"" introduction.  We took advantage of this by making breakfast and several dinners in his kitchen to cut down on our expenses.  He provided us access to his wireless internet, clean towels and sheets, and general tips about museums and sites to visit.  The location is perfect as there is a grocery story and mall underneath his apartment, plus a metro stop accessible from the mall, which runs on the main red line.  We had a fantastic experience and I would recommend anyone to stay here.  "

2904,581243,4674172,2013-05-20,376159,Nevena,"I stayed in Edwin's place for 1 night. The place is very well located, about 100 m from the metro station Karlaplan, in a beautiful and quiet area. It is above a big supermarket in a closed living complex. The apartment is really cosy, very clean, equipped with everything you need for your stay. Edwin and his son gave me a very warm welcome, I received information in advance. Everything was great. I would stay there again and reccomend it to everyone. "

His apartment has a great location: prestigious district, shopping centre and ATM on the ground floor, a 3 minutes’ walk from the subway and a 10 minutes’ walk from Djurgården. You have everything you may need in a flat; the room is very cosy and clean. Next time we visit Stockholm we surely stay at Edwin’s apartment. I advise this apartment to everybody!

A nice room in a quiet building in a lovely area of Stockholm, close to shops, metro and buses and within walking distance of the city centre. The Tallink ferry terminal is just one metro stop away. Edwin suggested  a local restaurant that was so good we went there twice.  We do recommend you stay with Edwin when in Stockholm."
2909,581243,5466084,2013-07-01,6253944,Diva,Great host. He helped me with transportation going to my ship and provided all info i needed. Ed's apartment was also convenient and centrally located.

2911,581243,5603210,2013-07-08,5146897,Julie,"THE NICEST AND BEST HOST you will ever meet. This was by far one of my best airbnb experiences ever. Upon arriving to Stockholm, we had a fair amount of luggage for just my mom and I. Edwin so kindly agreed to meet us at the train station to help us with the luggage and take us back to his place for no charge! Furthermore, we needed some Swedish currency, he offered to exchange euros with us for an even higher rate than offered by the local exchange office. I mean, come on! He then proceeded to offer us maps and advice on all kinds of Stockholm essentials.
  Other than his hospitality, his place is incredibly Convenient, Safe and Clean. About a 20 minute water side walk takes you to city center, and there is a shopping center with a supermarket literally downstairs from the apartment. My mom and I used his kitchen to make meals both nights. Clean and absolutely delicious! After taking nightly walks, we felt absolutely safe coming home around 11:30 (also because days are longer in the summer). Nice and residential area.
  Honestly, 5 star hotels would not provide you this homely service. What are you waiting for?"
2912,581243,5756665,2013-07-15,3445457,Eva,We had a perfect stay at edwin's place. We could use the kitchen and he was a polite and  living in his Appartement was really comfortable. Everything was perfectly clean and it was especially well located so we went everywhere by feet. 
2913,581243,5842949,2013-07-19,6248786,Simon,"Edwin has an exceptionally clean apartment in a good part of Stockholm; an easy walk down to the waterfront and ~20minutes walk to Central Station. There is a supermarket (and other shops) downstairs in the apartment block. His wife was away when we were there, but he was a very easy to get on with host.
We would have no hesitation in staying with him again when we are in Stockholm."
2914,581243,5883115,2013-07-21,6121360,Andrea,Edwin was a great host! His apartment is super clean and in a great location. He was friendly and helpful. He even did our laundry for us while we went to see the city during the day so we didn't have to worry about it. He will also exchange money from US Dollars or Euro at a better rate than the exchange places. I would highly recommend staying here!
2915,581243,6018797,2013-07-27,2667715,Gill,"A spotlless and comfortable place to stay.  Edwin made no fuss about us adding one  extra person to our booking, and was there to welcome us at 1.00a.m. Recommended."

The flat is super tidy clean and you can even use the kitchen. The flat is in a safe area and very central located. It is above a shopping center with various stores incl groceries and three min walk to karlaplan metro..

2919,581243,7069551,2013-09-05,7438458,Jimmy,"Amazingly clean apartment with beautifully landscaped courtyard for residents of the apartment complex only. Edwin was very accommodating. He wants to make sure that you have anything that you reasonably can. He made the kitchen available to us and gave us very helpful directions. He had maps available as well. Always very prompt to respond to airbnb messages with helpful advice as well. 

Protip: In Stockholm, you can't buy wine (or any alcohol) after 7 pm unless you're at a bar. Before 7 you can only buy it from the state run liquor store: Systembolaget. "

His apartment was spotless and centrally located, walkable to most of the main sights of Stockholm. The Karlaplan T-bana station is just a minute walk away, and there is a mall with a supermarket located right below his apartment. Talk about convenient!

His home is located very near public transportation, making it easy to get anywhere in the city.

To go shopping for groceries you can just take the elevator down to the shopping centre on the first floor and then cook away in Edwin's kitchen! The area of Östermalm is definitely upper-class, so I can highly recommend it! Thanks for a great stay!"
2931,581243,8430567,2013-10-30,6090669,Julia,"We had one night in Edwins apartment and it was really great. It's located quite good (underground in 2 minutes, bikes can also be borrowed), so you can walk to most of the sightseeing highlights of Stockholm. The Vasa museum is only 15 minutes walk away and if you don't mind walking you can also reach any other things. Edwin is a very nice host, he had maps he gave us and explained everything very well. We could use everything in his apartment and he even had towls for us. The kitchen had everything you needed. The internet also worked very good as Edwin also uses it quite often ;)!
We can really recommand this apartment, it is perfect for tqo people wanting to do some sightseeing in Stockholm!

The house was clean, the bed was big enough for 2, and he gave us towels. We booked just one room but he told us that was possible to use another room. The house is in a great location. You can find everything at the mall and a metro station also!
You can easily walk to the city center. We really enjoy our staying, highly reccomended."

Квартира поражает чистотой. В моем распоряжении была большая комната , балкон, компьютер (ноутбук), фен, хорошо оснащенная кухня. Месторасположение отличное, вблизи многих достопримечательностей. Рядом находятся остановки автобусов и станция метро. 
Особенное удобство заключается в том, что внизу находится уютный торговый центр с многочисленными магазинами, супермаркетами, аптеками, парикмахерскими, кафе и прочее. 
Эдвин очень приятный в общении, отзывчивый и заботливый человек. Он помогал мне во всем ,в чем я нуждалась.И в  своих следующих поездках в Стокгольм я бы хотела останавливаться только здесь.
Staying in a house of Edwin became for me a comfortable and enjoyable, despite the broken bathroom. The owner tried to minimize the discommodity concerned with this.
The apartment amazes purity. I had a large room, balcony, computer (laptop), hair dryer, well-equipped kitchen. 
Location is great, close to many touristic attractions . There are local buses and the metro station. 
Special commodity  is that the apartment is located above the cozy shopping center with numerous shops, supermarkets, pharmacies, hairdressers, cafes and so on.
Edwin is very pleasant in dialogue, responsive and caring person. He helped me with everything what I needed.
I wish Edwin sooner finish repairing a bathroom and start taking guests.I would highly recommend to stay at Edwin.

The apartment is superbly located - close to the city centre, with the shopping mall in the same building, and yet in a private and quiet area. The place was bright, clean, and comfortable. I spent quite a bit of time in the kitchen (yes, Edwin, the chicken!), but Edwin did not seem to mind. Eating a meal at the balcony in the afternoon sun was lovely. There is a reason why this place is usually booked out, so don't hesitate and send your request right away!"

There is a shopping center connected to the building on the ground floor which was great. I'd recommend this place to anyone! Thanks Edwin!
"
2973,581243,19262825,2014-09-09,7892601,Johana,"In my experience Edwin is the best Airbnb host. He provided us with detailed information, responded quickly and very accommodating. The place is very easy to find, opposite the station. We arrived very late at night and we found the place easily by following his information. The room/bathroom/apartment were super clean. The area is also nice, within a walking distance from museums, there's a mall with supermarket in the basement of the apartment building and there are restaurants nearby."
2974,581243,20091267,2014-09-23,19186578,Aleksey,"Эдвин очень гостеприимный. Встретил нас в 7 утра (!) и не пришлось ждать на улице. Всячески помогал по ходу нашего пребывания.
Хорошо говорит по-русски.
В квартире очень чисто и уютно (и тихо). Расположение суперское.
Остались очень довольны.

2979,581243,20982793,2014-10-08,17342700,Arnaldo,"A comfortable and pleasant stay at Edwin's. He is a very kind and friendly host. He provided me promptly  with all the information I needed, in order to reach his address. His flat is located in a very convenient area, with immediate access to a tube station and hence easily connected with the center of Stockholm. His flat has been recently refurbished with a modern style and is clean and welcoming. The bedroom is spacious and tidy. The materass is very comfortable - well done on that Edwin! I had a good rest, after a long day of business meetings in town. The bathroom was clean and convenient. I did not take advantage of the living room or the kitchen, as I arrived a bit late in the evening, but they are equally tidy. The next day I left the flat, and Edwin had gone to work already. Overall I had a good stay and will probably stay again at Edwin's next time I come to Stockholm. Definitely recommended."
2980,581243,21013889,2014-10-09,9608451,Guilhem,I had a very nice time at the place of Edwin!  His disponibility was perfect before and during my stay.  Definitely a place to stay if you need to go to Stockholm!
2981,581243,21149761,2014-10-12,21352744,Rehman,"Edwin was very friendly and welcoming. He explained everything (directions, etc..) very thoroughly. The place itself was clean and very well-kept and was situation on a big road which was pretty and in a generally nice area not too far from the city centre. Definitely worth a stay here for sure!"

The room itself was great for a couple, and the apartment was very clean and tidy. Edwin was a great host, very friendly and welcoming, and told us all the good local places to go. We didn't see much of him as we were out all the time, but would definitely recommend his place and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. "

2986,581243,22204505,2014-11-01,21821547,Gabi,"We had a brilliant time with Edwin and his wife (who didn't speak English, but Edwin's English was more than enough). He was a lovely, kind and generous host. He helped with any questions we had about local sights and getting around. I highly recommend getting the Stockholm card which gives you free access to public transport and entry into 80+ museums and attractions including boat canal tours, history museums etc. Highly recommend Vassa museum, containing the only ship recovered from the 17th century. Also the Skansen outdoor museum is amazing. Edwin will provide a lot of info. He and his wife were not around much and we could use the kitchen, bathroom and living room to our convenience. Would highly recommend this accommodation. Super close to train, really close to city and easy to walk around too. Enjoy - 10/10!"
2987,581243,22400737,2014-11-05,16671386,Shengchao,Edwin is very friendly and helpful. He gave us a very detailed paper about how to get to the house. And it is very convenient to get to. The room is clean and nice. Very nice stay.

2991,581243,23161399,2014-11-24,11907050,Melanie,"The apartment is very clean and nice. The room is like you can see it on the picture. We shared the kitchen and bathroom with Edwin and his wife, which was no problem. We used the kitchen every evening, it is a big kitchen and fully equipped. The bathroom is also very clean and nice. The apartment is located directly at Karlaplan metro station, which is two metro stops away from the central station. We enjoyed our stay a lot and recommend the apartment."
2992,581243,23277700,2014-11-27,1775658,Mado,"Edwin ist ein sehr freundlicher Mensch mit einer sehr sauberen und gemütlichen Wohnung, die in einer schönen und zentralen Gegend liegt, direkt über einem Shoppingcenter. Wir haben uns in den 3 Tagen unseres Aufenthalts sehr wohl gefühlt, haben schnell zur Wohnung gefunden, da er uns eine gute Wegbeschreibung geschickt hatte und würden das Inserat wärmstens weiterempfehlen. :)"
2993,581243,23294877,2014-11-28,6511107,CeCe,Edwin's apartment is in one of the coolest areas of Stockholm - it was very convenient to get to places with public transportation and is surrounded by many cafes and restaurants.  I highly recommend Edwin's listing! 
2994,581243,23434980,2014-12-01,4793037,Michael,"Edwin was a very friendly host.
The room was very clean and cosy.
We never took the metro because it is in a very central location.
Looking forward to come again."
2995,581243,23594237,2014-12-06,19100688,Stefan,"Edwin is a wonderful host, accommodating, great communication, and a lovely person.

2998,581243,25906362,2015-01-29,19520007,Susa & Niklas,"Although Edwin and his wife had to leave for a party he took all the time he needed to explain and show everything in the apartment. It was a very friendly welcome and in the forefront I got all the information I needed to find the house. He also reserved the room for me, because I had problems with my credit card.
Everything is extremely clean and I enjoyed every minute in my room. The bed is really warm, comfortable and fluffy. There is a lot of free space in the room to stow all your clothes. The Wi-Fi is fast and you also have a TV with a couple of stations in Swedish and English. Also the fully equipped kitchen can be used.
Like all the other guests I would highly recommend this place! Everything five stars."
2999,581243,26051371,2015-02-02,20785665,Marie,Super convenient location! Walkable to everywhere! Very happy with the accommodations and the hospitality! 
3000,581243,26194764,2015-02-06,26871789,Jude,"Edwin was very kind and helpful for direction guidances and information.

As the apartment is located on top of  the shopping centre it is very convenient  for getting things and many other aspect.  
The room was very clean, quiet and warm. 

I have walked to the apartment from the Stockholm central station. Because he described it will be only 25 minutes distance. However it took much longer and was quite hard. I would not recommend walking in snowy steep road especially when you have luggages. 

It was nice stay.

"
3001,581243,26254075,2015-02-08,368719,Connor,Nice clean room in a decent location. Edwin was very helpful!

The location is superb, with the underground station and a shopping center at the base of the building, and walking distance from many attractions in the city. I definitely recommend this place."
3003,581243,27173396,2015-02-27,8338454,Bénédicte,"Edwin's apartment and room was great. It was very clean and quiet. 
I was able to use the kitchen, which is great since restaurants in Stockholm are quite pricey.
The supermarket and mall downstairs are really practical if you need anything.
Edwin himself was really nice, helpful and welcoming.
I would definitely recommand staying at his place!"
3004,581243,27870742,2015-03-14,19879701,Sisi,"Great location of the apartment, just at the metro station.

When we arrived at the apartment, we were shocked at the well decorated home, everything is very beautiful in Blue and white color with a lot of paintings on the wall.

Edwin also reminded us the time for the Tallink Boat, and told us the way to get there, really nice and helpful.

Next time we will surely choose the apartment again."
3005,581243,28139764,2015-03-18,5767349,Sarah,"It was really nice staying at Edwin's for a night. Really central, nice neighborhood, so clean and not to mention, a very friendly host. "

Highly recommended! "
3010,581243,29778065,2015-04-12,24831045,Ali Cagatay,"Me and my girlfriend stayed there for three nights, and we have found the house extremely clean.

Edwin is a nice guy, and he knows English pretty well.
The house is pretty close to metro station (1 min walking), you can take the train there and go to city center in less than 10 minutes.

You can use the kitchen utensils (as long as you wash them afterwards), and cook your own food.

On my next visit to Stockholm, hopefully i will stay in the same house."
3011,581243,30007862,2015-04-15,961498,Michael,"The best way to let my fellow Airb&brs know of my experience with Edwin is to say:  I'll be back.  

This was my first experience with Airb&b and it was excellent.  VERY EASY.  Edwin and his wife are VERY clean.  The bed is EXCELLENT.  Absolutely no problems.

My highest recommendation.  Value for money is EXCELLENT!  (How will hotels survive AirB&B?)"
3012,581243,30178251,2015-04-18,16348312,Sandra,"Fantastic location close to
everything! Nice room with privacy (can lock door) and great hosts. "
3013,581243,30561964,2015-04-24,29614355,Samuli,"Suomeksi:
Huone oli erittäin puhdas ja kuvat vastaavat täysin todellisuutta. Edwin antoi meidän käyttää keittiötä aamupalojen ja välipalojen tekemiseen, myös jääkaappi oli meidän käytössä. Asunto sijaitsee Tukholman paremmalla alueella ja siellä oli täysin turvallista liikkua. Asunto on helppo löytää koska se sijaitsee aivan Karlaplanin metroaseman yläpuolella. Edwinin sai helposti kiinni emaililla ja hän oli oikein mukava.

In English:
The room was clean and exactly as it is in photos. We were allowed to use the kitchen and the fridge for breakfeast and small snacks. Edwin´s apartment is located in Stocholm's highend area. Apartment is very easy to reach with subway because it is located on top of the Karlaplan metro station. The area is safe and very close to most of the tourist attractions. Communication was very easy with Edwin and he was really nice to us."
3014,581243,30629954,2015-04-25,1758856,Arnaud,"Edwin is a very welcoming host. The flat is great, well-located, very clean. It was a great stay. Edwin made sure I ahd all I needed and gave me useful information about the area.
You can hear a bit the trafic, so if that is a problem for you, you'd better know.
I recommend this room :) !
Thanks a lot!"
3015,581243,30897348,2015-04-28,31190615,Kirsi,"Ediwin oli hyvin ystävällinen ja avulias. Hän lähetti hyvät saapumisohjeet minulle ennen matkaa. Perille oli helppo löytää ohjeiden mukaan. Sain avaimet ja luvan käyttää keittiötä ja jääkaappia.
Huone sopi erinomaisesti yhden yön yöpymiseen. Asunnon sijainti on loistava, kulkuyhteydet ovat hyvät ja kävellenkin pystyy ottamaan kaupungin haltuun. Voisin tulla toistekin!"
3016,581243,32172620,2015-05-15,25960167,Dominic,Super nice area. Place was beautiful designed. Really close to train station! Great value. Will stay here again next time I'm in Sweden!

3018,581243,32465060,2015-05-18,7483023,Naomi,Edwin and his wife were wonderfully helpful. They spent a long time explaining how the city runs. They were generous with letting us stay very late the day of checkout. Place was lovely and clean. 
3019,581243,32965022,2015-05-24,23547818,Jason,"From the beginning through the end, Edwin was kind, helpful, and discrete. It practically felt like I had the whole place to myself. 

The apartment was perfect and couldn't be more conveniently located (right above a modern shopping mall, and only a few stairs to the metro, and ~10mins. to Stockholm Central), and in such a beautiful neighbourhood!

I would highly recommend Edwin to anyone else looking for a clean, quiet, and comfortable stay in Stockholm and I would certainly come back for another stay the next time I'm in Stockholm!"
3020,581243,33977137,2015-06-03,22428511,Daniel,"We spent 9 nights at Edwin's. The room was exactly as described, quite comfortable and immaculately clean, just as the rest of the apartment. Even though we did not request it, our bed sheets and bath towels were changed after the first four days. We had easy access to the kitchen in the morning, and the fact that there is only one bathroom in the whole apartment turned out not to be  an issue.
Edwin and Ladiya are extremely gracious hosts, and Edwin's directions to find the apartment are flawless. The apartment is on the 4th floor of a very well located building. The Karlaplan metro station is right below the building. Once you exit the metro station you find yourself in a shopping center with two large supermarkets, a variety of shops, restaurants, and pharmacies. Shops close at 18:00 hrs and the supermarkets at 22:00 hrs.
We did all our touring on foot, because the apartment is only about ten minutes away from Strandvagen. 
We thank Edwin and his wife Ladiya for a very comfortable stay. "
3021,581243,34410087,2015-06-08,7316573,Annick,We really appreciated our stay in Edwin's apartment. It's a convenient place to visit the town.

Edwin was extremely welcoming and made us feel like the whole place was ours. Everything in the house was convenient and was a lovely walk away from everything. If you stay a few days I suggest the Stockholm pass. We hope to come back some day and will definitely stay here again!!
3025,581243,36647902,2015-06-30,23250006,Cynthia,"Edwin was very nice and his place was very clean.  When we arrived he explained everything to us.  Best of all was that it was conveniently located near buses, subway station, and a nice supermarket.  The room was a little small with no desk, but if you are out most of the time and only sleep, eat, and shower there it won't be an issue.  The kitchen was a nice size with plenty of dishes, pots & pans, glasses, etc."
3026,581243,42873994,2015-08-16,2382729,Dennis,"Thank you Edwin, we had a very pleasant stay! The room is well located and we could walk to all nice places in Stockholm (only a few hundred meters to all ""hotspots"").

Everything was clean and Edwin was very helpful in providing informations before our trip.

Highly recommended!"

Well located apartment, there is a metro stop across the street, which sometimes you wont even need because you can walk to them like the Vasa museum. The apartment is very clean and comfortable.

Edwin was very nice and helpful even thought we only met for a brief time. "
3028,581243,43783627,2015-08-22,36862559,Isabell,We enjoyed our trip to Stockholm! Edwin is a nice host - very friendly and helpful. The apartment and our room is very clean and comfortable. It takes about 25 minutes to go to the centre.

3036,581243,47422767,2015-09-18,2647055,Joe,"Edwin & Ladiya were very kind and gracious hosts. The room and apartment were exactly as photographed and described and the location is perfect! Edwin offered some great suggestions and went above and beyond when I had questions or needed some help. This apartment is in the lovely Ostermalm neighborhood, which is a really beautiful place where a lot of locals live. Plenty of shopping, grocery, and some great restaurants nearby, not to mention that central Stockholm and all of the tourist sites are an easy 15 minute walk away. The Karlaplan metro stop is literally just downstairs as well, which made getting to/from the central station a simple 5 minute train ride.  If you stay here, I'd also recommend checking out the local cafe/restaurant called Broms, which is just around the corner. Excellent food and drinks!

The location is good, in the calm part of the city, but with all necessary right at hand (shopping mall on the ground floor). 20 minutes of calm walk to the city center, same amount of time in other direction to the ferry.
The apartment is extremely clean, the bed is comfy, and we used the kitchen too, it contains everything needed for big cooking or just heating up.
There is also a drawer and shelfs in the room, which I found very useful."

Bed is good, internet is fast, bathroom is just near the bedroom, and Edwin is very nice!

Very good stay!"

3062,581243,62332894,2016-02-14,10224833,Arpit,"The room in Edwin's house was beautiful, and just as shown in the picture. The house is centrally located and 10-15 mins walking distance to the area where all the museums are located. It is also near the old Stockholm area (gamla stan) by metro (less than ten mins by metro). Edwin kindly gave the directions to his house and travel details very very clearly and we had absolutely no problem reaching the place. "
3063,581243,62858517,2016-02-17,56997425,Craig,"A friend and I stayed overnight in Edwin's room and had a fine time. His place is VERY conveniently located to the subway station, which made navigating the city while under a tight schedule much easier. The room wasn't huge but the bed was which made sleeping much easier. He keeps his place very clean and let us use his kitchen which was very nice. He even let us keep our bags in the apartment past checkout time as our flight out was very late. Overall a pleasant experience and I would certainly recommend it to a friend."

We were staying two nights in his beautiful apartment near to the city center.  We didnt even have to use public transport,  the flat is within walking distance to the Gamla stan or Vasa museet. I can recomand this host and his unbelievably clean flat to everyone who wants to spend awesome time in Stockholm!"

When I tried to ask a question during my check-in, her response was that she doesn't speak English. This could be a problem if you have questions or need help in English. "
3071,581243,69163238,2016-04-09,44481147,Chloé,"La chambre correspond à la photo, l'appartement était très propre et plutôt bien situé (10min de métro du centre). Edwin et sa femme étaient très accueillants et accommodants : nous avons pu déposer nos sacs dans l'appartement tôt le matin après être descendues du ferry et nous avons pu les y laisser la journée où nous partions pour pouvoir visiter tranquillement. Edwin nous avait également envoyé un mail très précis pour arriver jusqu'à l'appartement, qui était donc très facile à trouver. Je recommande !  "
3072,581243,69975504,2016-04-15,36507713,Sophia,"Edwin und seine Frau waren sehr freundlich. Da das Englisch seiner Frau nicht so gut war, haben sie beide schon vorgesorgt, sodass wir uns trotzdem mit Hilfe von Bildern und Notizen verständigen konnten. Wir haben unsere Ruhe gehabt aber für Smalltalk war Edwin zu haben. Es schien als hätte es ihm Freude bereitet uns Tips für die Stadt zu geben und er hat sehr gerne von seinen Reisen erzählt. "
3073,581243,70134555,2016-04-16,41019282,Doyoun,"Edwin is the best host.

Thank you. Edwin ^^"
3074,581243,70757868,2016-04-20,6064554,Matt,"Edwin made us feel very welcome and recommended an excellent place for dinner. The room is exactly as it looks and the bathroom is also nice with a good shower (toilet's a bit close to the sink haha! ) 
Couldn't be more convenient for shops as it is above a shopping mall. 
Very easy to get to from and Edwin was very helpful with directions from airport etc. "

3079,581243,73184653,2016-05-07,7635446,Rachel,"Edwin was very accommodating and the apartment was very clean and comfortable! Even when we arrived late after 10pm he was very easy to communicate with and we were able to get into the building with no problem. The apartment is a short walk to the shopping streets, though a little removed so a bit quieter, which was nice. Highly recommended!"
3080,581243,73298556,2016-05-08,54563307,Christopher,"Edwin was an excellent host, and his place is incredibly nice and clean.  He was very understanding even though we showed up kind of late because of travel delays, and his place is in a great location.  There is a huge shopping mall on the ground floor, and there's a metro station right outside, although you can walk to most places.  I would definitely stay at Edwin's place again. "
3081,581243,73912359,2016-05-11,26575159,Josef,Edwin hosted us in nice clean room which is in fourth floor apartment. The location is in the beautiful and save neighborhood that is close (10 mins walking) to Djurgården. The apartment is situated above the shopping center where you can find everything you need. The room looks exactly as described.  
3082,581243,75125900,2016-05-19,2587748,Atsuko,"Very clean room with lots of sunlight.  Facing to park, downstairs are shops/ metro.  Quite convenient location.  
Detailed instructions from airport.  Easy access."
3083,581243,75154558,2016-05-19,36845896,Prajith,"Edwin was perfect in his instructions on how to reach the apartment and we had a really warm welcome. The description of the apartment is absolutely accurate and the neighbourhood was really nice with respect to connectivity to all tourist places and the city center via bus/metro. The apartment is very clean and tidy and the kitchen was fully equipped to cook your own food. One thing which we did not like was the flexible checkout time which was mentioned in the description. We reached at around 7PM and we had our return, the next day at 7PM. So, we were told (a bit rudely!) that we can keep our luggage outside the room after 11AM but we should not be in the house after 12PM, as they were expecting another guest and they did not want many people in the house. Also there was a bit of language problem (English) speaking with them and that made it a bit uncomfortable. Uncomfortably, we kept our luggage there till 5PM and then we came back, picked it up and left. Apart from this, everything was good."
3084,581243,75626880,2016-05-22,70305854,Shih,Great location - extremely clean place - host was very accommodating - we checked out late and host has new guests coming in right after us but was still able to accommodate us.

3090,581243,79976410,2016-06-15,81,Horace,"Edwin was extremely communicative. The listing is tucked deep into a quiet apartment complex, so Edwin sent thorough instructions for getting to the listing from the (very close) metro station, which proved to be vey helpful. The room was quiet, clean, and very comfortable, as was the bathroom. I had a great night's sleep here!

Edwin and his wife were very friendly and accommodating hosts. I would highly recommend staying here."

As soon as you enter the room, you can smell the fresh linens. The apartment was right across the subway, and only a couple of stops away from the main attractions. Overall, it was a pleasant stay."

Edwin shows lots of hospitality and welcomes me. He replied me quickly so that I could move in as soon as possible. Besides, he described the directions to his apartment vividly, and thus I could find the location without any problems. Most important thing of all is the location is perfect, just across from the metro station.( It is hard for u to miss) I dropped my luggage early in the morning and he even let me leave my luggage in his apartment when I wen to another city, so I could travel light without dragging heavy bags, which really saved me lots of trouble. Thank u, Edwin.
"
3097,581243,83126903,2016-07-01,67172589,Lydia,"Edwin's place was very easily accessible on public transport, with the complex right outside a train station and bus stops. It seemed like a nice area and the apartment was secure in a swipecard access only area. 
I was out a lot but when I was home Edwin was very friendly and asked if there was anything he could do to help me with my sightseeing plans or to make ,y stay more comfortable. The apartment was spotless and very comfortable, with a nice bathroom and large room. "
3098,581243,83723099,2016-07-04,6054319,Shu Haur,"Edwin was such a great host. He made sure that I'm comfortable with the living situation by making sure the room and apartment clean and tidy.

Make sure to follow the directions he sends to you exactly otherwise you will have a difficult time finding the apartment. He was pretty straight forward with very little small talk. Edwin provided information about Sweden, but it would have been nice to learn more about him.  Otherwise he was a good host. "

I felt very welcomed during my stay. The location is also perfect! It is very close to downtown area. And I could get easily to all the attractions by walk. The apartment has everything you need. I definitely recommend it!

There are a lot of points with bicycles for rent near the flat. At the ground floor you can find shopping center with two supermarkets. The City Hall and Gamla stan are within walking distance.
Edwin and Lada are hospitable hosts. They speak English and Russian. With a great pleasure they told about main sights and ways how to reach them. Strongly recommend this room both for couples and for people, who travel alone."

He is very responsive on Airbnb chat and made communicating with him a pleasure. Edwin welcomed us and made us feel at home. The room and his apartment in general was extremely clean and tidy (especially kitchen and bathroom - absolutely spotless). Location very Central and only short walks to town or a short metro ride away if you won't enjoy walking. All in all highly recommended and would stay here again next time I'm in Stockholm

Very central to most of the attractions and the best thing of all is it is above two big supermarkets and a shopping mall! Bed is very comfortable. Maybe a little noisy while sleeping at night as it is next to the main road, but it is super good location next to the train station. Would highly recommend all guests to stay when visiting Stockholm! 

Edwin was very friendly and accomodating as he waited for us till late to receive us. Very clear check-in instructions and Edwin is willing to take time to share with us on directions and attractions around the area! "

3172,581243,148197690,2017-04-30,118222509,Siarhei,"Эдвин очень гостеприимный и дружелюбный хозяин, хорошо знает русский язык! Не смотря на то, что мы приехали в будний день, Эдвин встретил нас раньше, чем было написано в описании его жилья и нам не пришлось бродить по городу с сумками в ожидании времени заселения. Квартира очень чистая и светлая, есть все, что нужно для комфортного пребывания, включая хорошо оборудованную кухню. Находится в пешей доступности от вокзала (около 30 минут) и всех основных достопримечательностей Стокгольма, благодаря чему можно совсем не пользоваться общественным транспортом и сэкономить приличную сумму денег! А они в Стокгольме точно пригодятся! :) Прямо рядом с домом находится вход в метро Карлаплан и остановка автобуса, если вдруг понадобится. Бесплатный исторический музей находится в 800 метрах от дома, Васа, Скансен, Лунапарк -- чуть дальше по той же улице. Все действительно очень близко.
Стоит отметить, что на цокольном этаже в доме Эдвина, находится большой торговый центр с несколькими супермаркетами, магазинами одежды (например H&M), магазином с алкоголем, много кафе и пр. 
Еще хочется сказать, что видели Эдвина мы только в день приезда. Он нам все показал, рассказал как чем пользоваться, вручил ключи, а дальше мы жили как буд-то в отдельной квартире! Нам все очень понравилось! Спасибо, Эдвин. Всем рекомендую!"
3173,581243,149440141,2017-05-04,42435059,Claudio,Edwin is really helpful and the flat is comfortable and clean. Recommended!

I arrived really late due to a delayed flight, and Edwin was so kind to stay up late just for me. The communication beforehand was very detailed; I had no problems finding my way to his flat and around the building. The room is bright, tidy and comfortable, and the whole flat is very clean and convenient. 

The location is great - there are just two stops by metro to the main station (where the airport bus also stops). Stockholm is a fairly small town, so you can easily walk to the main attractions, but different transport modes are within easy reach of the apartment. It is also located on top of a small mall, so you can shop for groceries within 30 seconds of leaving the flat. Shops and restaurants are also around the corner, as is a small market at the weekend.

All in all, it is a very good place to stay when in Stockholm, with Edwin being very considerate and helpful. Thank you again, Edwin! "

He had great communication and allowed us to leave our bags after we had checked because we had an extremely late bus ride to Gothenburg.

His and his wifes apartment is spacious, beautiful and extremely clean as the guest room is too and has a very comfy bed. The apartments location is perfect - you can reach most spots by foot or city bikes or public transport (stations are very close to the flat). We had the impression as if the host wasn't really living there with us, kitchen and bathroom could be used any time without any problems. I highly recommend this place and its generous host."

Very very central location (3 mins walk to Karlaplan station) and djurgården is 10 mins walk. Edwin is a very professional host, he was very accomodating (we checked in late). Can't think of anything that the host has not thought about, that made the stay so comfortable. We felt that we almost had the whole apartment to ourselves for 3 nights, even though we had just the room. Would strongly recommend the place to any fellow traveller to Stockholm."

We drove to Stockholm by car, and Edwin was very kind to provide us with all the information needed to find his apartment and also parking. We expected parking to be difficult to come by in Stockholm, but there are plenty of cheap and safe street parking available close by. The neighbourhood is calm and quiet, and the apartment is located above a shopping mall where you get easily shop for groceries. It is located very close to a metro station, so if you are using public transport, it is not an issue at all.

I will definitely recommend this place to travellers to Stockholm! Not only is it a very economical choice, but it is located in a peaceful and calm neighbourhood, away from the hustle and bustle of the city, yet appreciably close (we walked to the city by foot, without any problems)."
3202,581243,177538510,2017-08-03,23013743,Carol,"I arrived Edwin's place on a Saturday and the check-in time is flexible on weekends. I was warmly greeted by Edwin once I arrived and he showed me around in the apartment. Also, he recommended me different places to visit in Stockholm. 

Getting to the apartment from the airport was easy. First, I took an airport bus to the city centre (T-centralen) *NOTE- a single ticket is 99SEK if you buy online in advance; 119SEK if you pay on board* Then I took the subway to Karlaplan station, which is 2 stops away from T-centralen. From there, you can walk to his apartment building within 3 minutes. You'll need a key to get access to the building, everything's automatic, safe and convenient! Also, the building is located above a shopping mall. You'll find 2 supermarkets, some restaurants and shops there. 

As for the apartment itself, it was extremely clean and neat. It really felt like home and I enjoyed my stay at Edwin's place. Thank you so much!

3204,581243,179694452,2017-08-08,66092452,Jc,"For the price this place is terrific. Close to a grocery store, and literally a block away from the subway. Clean, quiet, and with all the amenities we needed. Would stay here again!"
3205,581243,180452738,2017-08-10,19429060,Kieron,"Edwin is a very warm and gracious host! His apartment is very convenient to get to, and his directions were impeccable. Everything you need is available in the shops directly beneath his apartment, walking distance to many attractions and museums. All in all we had a great experience, highly recommended!"
3206,581243,182357507,2017-08-14,12618142,Guillaume,Edwin nous a accueilli très tardivement et a été discret durant notre séjour. La chambre sans être très grande été propre et fonctionnelle. Je recommande cet appartement pour la localisation et le calme du quartier.
3207,581243,183861439,2017-08-18,141535670,Sara,"You'll notice Edwin is a super clean and careful person. And I found him very polite and organized. He has made me really comfortable during my stay and kindly greeted me and taught me how to use elevator, door etc. since Sweden was very new to me. Edwin is very knowledgeable abt which tickets for transportation is the best for you, and nice area to visit etc. and really if there's any question, you should ask. He will be prompt and kind to help you out. He's cool abt letting me use the kitchen, and even said it was ok to keep my stinky cheese in the refrigerator :) The only thing I've found difficult was that sometimes wifi was not working fast in my room. But I have a feeling the modem is not close to my room and may not be for everyone."
3208,581243,184613719,2017-08-20,55846135,Christopher,We loved our stay at Edwin's apartment. The room was perfect for a couple and we took advantage of his sunny porch to drink coffee and eat pastries from the shopping plaza directly under the building. The walk to Old Town was easy and it is very quick to get to Djurgarden (where many museums including the Vasa are located). Edwin was so nice and made us feel at home.  We would definitely stay here again next time in Stockholm!
3209,581243,185289614,2017-08-21,93626806,Dongyang,Edwin is a very nice host and hia place is comfortable. Recommoned!
3210,581243,186674231,2017-08-25,51617700,Carly,"Edwin's place was just as described. Very central and easy to get around- there's a metro stop just by the apartment. A lot of museums and sights are walking distance from the apartment, making this the perfect place to venture from! There is also a supermarket and other shops on the ground floor, which is handy."
3211,581243,187478133,2017-08-27,132073969,Kindson,"This is my first experience on AirBnB and travel in Europe. I stay two days in Edwin's Home. The room is clean and comfortable. And Edwin has prepared everything before I come. After I get the key from Edwin, I always not at that home. Therefore, I have few interactions with Edwin. Nevertheless, I added Edwin's (Hidden by Airbnb) . I preferred to text him as my English accent is quite different from Edwin. Edwin answered all my questions very soon. At last, the room is worth to rent, it is near the centre of Odd City Zone. Only 3 metro stations to there."
3212,581243,188056708,2017-08-28,32339330,Christina,"Perfect location! Close to public transportation, shopping, and walking distance too almost everything! Very clean and nicely secured place. Edwin also provided us some great help on directions to places."
3213,581243,190424824,2017-09-04,378133,Parinaz,Edwin was a great host. The house is beautiful with all the amenities and is extremely central. The train station is right below the house making it very convenient to commute. Highly recommend this apartment.
3214,581243,190813290,2017-09-05,148506092,Andreea,"Edwin was great to communicate with, he explained how to get to his place very clearly and gave me a lot of information. His apartment was extremely clean and he was very welcoming and friendly. He also gave us a lot or information on how to get around the city and enjoy our stay. Would definitely recommend :)"
3215,581243,191160546,2017-09-06,19593541,Nina,"Discreet and foresight host, Edwin gave me the booking's day all the necessary information to arrive at the apartment. Well located in a residence above a shopping mall and subway. Super clean, bedroom as described. No difficulty leaving keys the last day."
3216,581243,201819454,2017-10-09,14523901,Rosine,"Great place. We recommend it for the location and the kindness of the host, Edwin."
3217,581243,204050108,2017-10-16,95894472,Christopher,"Edwin's place is clean and located right above the metro, 2 stops from central station, so it's very easy to get anywhere.  If you don't get the Stockholm pass, I'd recommend at least getting the 24hr metro card.  Edwin's proximity to the Karlaplan station makes this the best/cheapest way to get around.

A lot of his neighborhood closes early, even on weekends (a lot was closed by 6pm Saturday for us), but it's still a pretty lively area."
3218,581243,204434289,2017-10-18,62737798,Yiheng,It’s the second time we stay at Edwin’s house. It’s very clean and convenient! Close to metro station and shopping center. Edwin is very nice and helpful! We will definitely come here again!

O apartamento é super bem localizado, praticamente na porta de saída de uma estação do metrô e a hospitalidade do Edwin foi espetacular. O espaço estava sempre muito limpo e organizado. Além disso, o Edwin ainda nos permitiu usar a cozinha do apartamento, o que facilitou muito os nossos dias em Estocolmo. Detalhe: há um shopping com supermercado no mesmo prédio do apartamento, o que ajuda ainda mais a se abastecer para os dias em Estocolmo, onde  o preço das refeições é relativamente alto. Resumindo: estadia perfeita!!"

His communication was excellent and he provided detailed information on how to get to the apartment. He was a very welcoming and friendly host and the room and apartment was extremely well looked after. The room was simple but very clean and comfortable and I think it was good value for Stockholm, which can be an expensive city. I would definitely recommend Edwin's place."

Since I arrived quite tired and Edwin went to work early morning so we didn’t communicate a lot but he’s a nice host. I would like to recommend to other peoples then."

The real treasure of this apartment is Edwin himself. He is a genuinely nice person who helped me out with a late check-in from the airport, something most other hosts would not have assisted with.

Ubicación muy céntrica, lo que nos ayudó a descubrir la ciudad sin perder mucho tiempo en desplazamientos (tanto la estación de bicicletas “City Bikes” como el metro “Karlaplan” están a pocos pasos de la puerta del edificio –y a sólo 2 paradas/5 minutos en metro de la estación central de Estocolmo-). Además hay un supermercado, restaurantes y cafeterías en el centro comercial de la planta baja del edificio. Edwin fue un anfitrión muy simpático a la vez que muy discreto. Recomendaría sin lugar a duda este alojamiento. 
**FRA** Appartement très calme, bien équipé pour un court séjour à Stockholm et situé dans une résidence close et aménagée d’agréables jardins. Sa localisation est très bonne, ce qui nous permit de découvrir la ville sans perdre trop de temps en déplacements (la borne de vélos ”City Bikes » comme la bouche de métro ”Karlaplan” se trouvent à quelques mètres à peine de la porte de la résidence –et à seulement 2 stations/5mn de la gare principale T-Centralen). En outre, il y a un supermarché, des restaurants et cafés dans le centre commercial du rez-de-chaussée de la résidence. Edwin fut un hôte très sympathique et discret à la fois. Je recommande vivement cet appartement.
**ENG** Very quiet and well-equipped apartment in a gated community with nice gardens; ideal for a short stay at Stockholm. Its location is very good to discover the town: the “City Bikes” station and the “Karlaplan” subway station are only few steps ahead from the door of the residence. The “T-Centralen” railway station is only 2 stops/5 minutes away by subway. There is a supermarket, some restaurants and cafés in the shopping center of the ground floor of the apartment building. Edwin is a very friendly and discreet host at a time. I highly recommend this apartment."

On Edwin's wise advice we were able to make a brief discovery of a Stockolm district a stone's throw from his home. Our stopover was short because we had our ferry early the next day but we keep a very good memory.

3368,581243,517005977,2019-08-25,14309870,Anastasija,"Edwin's place location is perfect for exploring Stockholm, just outside the apartment, there are a metro station and shopping centre. Also, the apartment is super clean and comfortable. Thank you, Edwin, for such a pleasant stay!"
3369,581243,518043844,2019-08-26,46432082,Shira,"Edwins place is a great place to stay, and was the perfect room for us to crash in for our layover. Nice area, comfy bed, and a Edwin is super generous in sharing his space!"
3370,581243,518794254,2019-08-27,92669132,Alex,Nice room and very clean! Edwin was super helpful and gave really good directions!
3371,581243,519731105,2019-08-29,134022808,Logan,"Edwin's home was a nice place in a quiet neighborhood, a short train ride to the city. Public transit was super easy and you could probably walk as well. It's located right above a mall/supermarket with lots of options for dining and shopping. Edwin was hospitable and his home was a great value for our quick trip to Stockholm."
3372,581243,521696154,2019-09-01,48083264,Taylor,Great place for a quick stopover in Stockholm! Very conveniently located to public transportation and everything you’d want to see in the city!
3373,608672,1978665,2012-08-13,3214604,Sonja,"Great apartment, very clean, nicely decorated and centrally located in Stockholm. Karl was very nice, helping us find our way in the apartment and the city (with a city map). There is a entrance to the room, separated from the rest of the house. The room is furthermore separated from the house by doors that are blocked. "
3374,608672,3482661,2013-02-05,4713130,Helena & Thomas,"Small flat in the heart of Stockholm. Just at the end of Drottninggatan, old town in walk distance, 10min! The room is small but big enough for a couple of days. We did enjoy our stay!"
3375,608672,3587496,2013-02-19,4987137,Rafał,"Staying at Karl's was great. His apartment was really comfy and he was extremely helpful.

Karl's apartment is definitely great for short visits like ours."
3376,608672,4183958,2013-04-16,5514788,Cíntia,"Karl is ultra attentive, friendly and gave us great tips on where to eat and what to visit in the city.
The room was comfortable and clean, and the location was very good, next to the subway and a 10-15 minute walk from the center.
The bathroom, though small, was ok.
My husband and I enjoyed our stay and would go back for sure.
Thanks, Karl! :)"
3377,608672,4742728,2013-05-23,5347173,Marina,"Cet appartement est très bien placé et propre.
L'hôte Karl est accueillant et sympa, il parle le français.
Le seul bémol dont nous ferons part est la douche dont l'utilisation n'est pas du tout pratique, il faudra absolument que ce système soit réadapté, nous avons failli nous noyer, mais nous avons bien ri...."
3378,608672,5065394,2013-06-10,1634113,Alan,"Karl is an excellent, friendly host! When we arrived, he greeted us and provided plenty of directions and suggestions. But then he gave us our privacy. The room was very clean and bigger than we expected. More than enough room for me and my wife. Also, the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was also very clean but the shower is complicated to use. Basically, we got water all over the bathroom floor every time we used it. It requires a few minutes of clean up afterward. The apartment's location is amazing. It's in a lovely, safe neighborhood. Only two blocks from Djorrtingham, which is the main pedestrian road with shops and restaurants. Only 20 minute walk to Gamilstan, where you find the royal palace. Honestly, we walked everywhere and only used public transportation to get to and from the airport. Never had to call a cab. We would absolutely recommend Karl's place and would definitely stay here again. "
3379,608672,5976812,2013-07-24,7213841,Joseph,A++  experience all the way... Karl is a gracious host who went out of His way to help Me.. The apartment itself is a stones throw from the center but on a quiet side street. Very clean and cozy with a small kitchenette... Would definitely like to stay again if I return.
3380,608672,6362456,2013-08-10,5592381,Lyn,"This flat is in an ideal location close to the  longest shopping streets loaded with department stores clothing and shoe shops not to mention great spots to eat & have a coffee. Easy walk to old town and modern shopping area too- close to transport.
The room has seperate access so you can come and go without disturbing anyone - it has an area to prepare meals with a fridge and kettle and your own bathroom.. You have a tv and a comfy bed. Great way to experience Stockholm like a local.
Great friendly hosts! Loved my stay recommend having a meal at a nearby pub too. "
3381,608672,6532114,2013-08-16,6715964,Heather,We loved Stockholm and staying at the flat contributed to this.  The location couldn't have been better with the city centre and Galma Stan all in easy walking distance.  
3382,608672,6686727,2013-08-21,7046939,Maria,"Great location in the centre of Stockholm, in an old beautiful building. The flat is small, but comfortable (except bathroom, which is a little bit strange) and clean. Karl was very nice and helpful host. The contact with him worked without any problems. Thank you Karl :)"
3383,608672,7216578,2013-09-11,6690594,Linda,Quiet room with computer desk.   Mini kitchen and closet.  Very small bathroom with odd shower arrangement - very difficult to avoid getting water onto floor. Location is reasonably central.  Easy access to supermarket and public transit.

3385,608672,7880591,2013-10-07,8585249,Marc,"A very nice and tidy apartment on third floor with comfortable bed, bathroom and small kitchen with everything you need for a city trip. Television is there but was not used :), a nice desk gives you the opportunity to use your laptop or write letters etc. The room is quiet and has a big window towards the back of the building with view to a well kept patio. Karl is a great host and gives you all the information you need for great experience in Stockholm area. I enjoyed my stay very much and definitely recommend this place. Some of my friends (all in all a group of 15 from all over europe) stayed in other places in city area during our visit and from their comments I can say Karl's is the best and most comfortable for sure."
3386,608672,7998189,2013-10-12,7963742,Catarina,"Karl was a great host. 
The studio was spacious enough and it had everything I needed.

Definitely a trip worth-

3391,608672,8686360,2013-11-12,680195,Morgan & Gwen,The flat has a perfect situation in central Stockholm close by feet from central station and main shopping streets. Karl is helpful ( great communication ) and our coming was well prepared.

L'appartement est confortable et son prépriétaire ""Karl"" est fort sympathique.
Karl métrisse plusieurs langues et tout particulèrement  le français .
je recommande cet appartement.

Очень хорошее расположение - недалеко от метро, прямо рядом с основной пешеходной улицей, по которой легко и быстро можно придти в центр и на вокзал. Мы останавливались на 3 ночи, на такой период прекрасное соотношение цена-качество. "
3394,608672,9269931,2013-12-17,3846026,Giuseppina,"Karl is a very kindle host and a nice person!
He send us all the direction to reach his home, and gave us good recomendations to stay in stockholm.
The apartment was clean and  very cozy, even if it could be an accomodation for few days, because has been obtained from his own home. there is also a little kitchen, and Karl offers its guests also coffee and tea for breakfast.
Moreover the position is really central! simple to reach from the central station and also close to the old city and to a metro station.
Really Good!"
3395,608672,9461681,2013-12-30,8860899,Daniela-Karin,"We stayed at Carls place for a few days at the end of december 2013. As we were told in advance, Carl was on vacation, but his son Gabriel welcomed us very friendly. The bedroom was clean and fairly furnished, just like the pictures show. The bed was comfortable, with a super soft mattress. We never used the kitchen, because it's too small for two, but it would be fine to make coffee and simple snacks. The shower takes a bit getting used to, since there is no water basin, but it's bearable. We just didn't like it, that the bathroom door would not lock. As guests you need to consider that the apartment walls are thin like paper. We could hear quite well when there were people talking text-door, but we didn't feel disturbed. In fact we had a really nice stay and can absolutely recommend this place! Not to forget, the location is great. "
3396,608672,10086565,2014-01-29,5835399,Cynie,Karl was extremely generous and helpful to show us round. The flat was exquisite and I would love to go back and visit again! Thank you Karl! :)

3398,608672,10268838,2014-02-10,4970823,Signe,Perfect place super central in Stockholm. Great host that gave me sufficient info and maps. Thanx Karl! Can definately recommend this place. Close to the subway too and a short walk to everything! PS. Ilcaffe right by in Drotningens gatan was the perfect breakfast place. 2 minutes away! 
3399,608672,10682360,2014-03-03,6260122,Sigurhanna,"We stayed in Karl's appartment for five nights in February 2014. 
It is very well located, one of Stockholm's main shopping street is just around the corner. 
It is small and you cannot do a lot of cooking in the kitchen but for people staying over short term and willing to eat out it is perfect. 
It is just like a hotel room basically with a small kitchen added. 
Karl was very helpful in every way. "
3400,608672,10805131,2014-03-08,12290482,David,The apartment is cosy and cheerful. Karl was very welcoming and accommodating. Good location close to the centre of the city and easy access to the public transport.
3401,608672,10846631,2014-03-10,12086203,Roine,Perfect place to be when exploring Stockholm. Karl was very flexible on check in. He was very accomodating and extremely friendly without overstepping any boundries. Highly recommended from me. I will probably stay there if I need in-town accomodation again. Tack.
3402,608672,12280265,2014-04-28,5578374,Anne,"My brother and I stayed in Karl's room for 5 days in April. The room was only yards away from all our favourite stores, so we had a great time staying here. Karl was very nice and also told us some interesting facts about the building, the street and Stockholm itself. The room itself was perfect for our stay. We used the little kitchen to heat up pancakes for breakfast! All together, I would highly recommend Karl as a host!"

3404,608672,13210002,2014-05-22,13077971,Leslie,Karl was a great host. He kept good contact leading up to our trip and clear instruction on how to find his place. Apartment is as pictured: small but easily slept two people for 3 nights. Quiet and clean. Wifi helped us plan our stay in Stockholm. Within walking distance of central city and T-bana. Would recommend.
3405,608672,13352504,2014-05-26,4829802,Stephanie,"Karl hat uns sehr herzlich empfangen. Er hat sich Zeit genommen, uns einige Sachen Stockholms zu erklären. Als wir ankamen, war es sehr heiss. Karl hat uns eine grosse Flasche Wasser in den Kühlschrank gestellt. Das war sehr nett.
Das einzige, was uns gestört hat, war die Dusche. Das Bad war anschliessend überflutet. Aber wenn man bedenkt, dass diese Location sehr zentral ist, nimmt man das Bad auch in Kauf."
3406,608672,13479916,2014-05-28,14421438,Jackson,Nice apartment and great host. Highly recommended.. everything you need for an apartment is provided..

3408,608672,14495864,2014-06-20,2003561,Joy,"Excellent location within walking distance of Central Station and other public transportation. Very clean, small flat that met all of our needs! Karl was a great host and quick to respond to all communications. Highly recommend!"

His wife was also very lovely to meet during our check in. The place itself was perfect! Spacious enough for two and has everything you need. We appreciated the pastries, fruit and water that was left for us. Location was also very central - close to the main city areas within Stockholm. "
3410,608672,14747909,2014-06-25,16120541,Christoph,Everything was as described. Shower is a little bit difficult to handle but works out. The room was clean and welcoming.
3411,608672,14904324,2014-06-29,1614974,Christian & Walter,"Karl and Karin were great host. Apartment was perfectly clean, neat and sunny. They left water for us in the minifridge. Room is small but with all the things you need. A good bed, nice sofa, a desk and space for hanging clothes. A separate small area where you can find a microwave, small fridge, and a heater for a morning tea. Bathroom was small but nice. After you showered you have to dry the floor but that was not a problem for us. Location is perfect. Building has an elevator that is helpfull when you have heavy luggage. We definetely recommend this apartment. Thanks Karl and Karin!!! We had a great time in Stockholm. Chris and Walter."
3412,608672,15441749,2014-07-09,12361394,Elise,"Nice host, he speaks many languages and he is always available to give advices and to help. The apartment is in the heart of Stockholm and this is the great advantage for visiting the city. The bathroom and the kitchen were very small. The big room was cosy. Everything was clean."
3413,608672,15570178,2014-07-12,5380634,Janette,Karl was so helpful and made our stay as easy as possible. Easily contactable and no issues with arrival and departure
3414,608672,15946809,2014-07-19,11957782,Tamara,"Karl ist wirklich ein sehr netter Vermieter. Und natürlich hatten auch wir die von vielen schon angesprochene Flasche Wasser im Kühlschrank. 

Und ja: Das Bad ist völlig überflutet, wenn man duscht, aber die baulichen Gegebenheiten lassen es anderes halt einfach nicht zu und das ist dann auch schon okay.

Was wir viel störender fanden - unabhängig davon, dass Karl wirklich total nett ist - dass wir durch die Türen jedes Wort, jede Musik, einfach alles von Karl und seiner Frau mitbekommen haben (und umgekehrt halt auch). 

Wir haben uns dadurch mehr als WG-Bewohner statt als Appartement-Inhaber gefühlt, was wir uns anders erhofft hatten. 

Kochen ist in der Küche tatsächlich gar nicht möglich, weil man dort auch nicht spülen kann. Das muss man dann im Bad tun (was in der Regel überflutet ist :-) ). 

Nunja, die Lage ist halt perfekt. Und dementsprechend ist es definitiv eine gute Adresse. Zumindest dann, wenn das Wetter passt und man viel draußen sein kann. 

Ganz herzlichen Dank noch einmal lieber Karl und weiterhin alles Gute!"
3415,608672,16292853,2014-07-25,6260962,Seung-Hoon,"Karl was very nice and friendly, offering many tips for traveling too. I enjoyed this small but cozy independent room like a hotel room (except the ad hoc inconvenient shower facility). From there you can easily walk along a car-free shopping street all down to the center of the city."
3416,608672,16455376,2014-07-28,14077327,Eva,"We were in Stockholm for only 3 days. Karl was really helpful, he provided very clear instructions about how to commute from the airport to the apartment.
The flat is really clean, the location is amazing, only 10 minutes walk from the center!
Karl is really friendly, the flat is furnished with a TV, private bathroom and a small kitchen.
We had an amazing time!"
3417,608672,16675740,2014-07-31,1209940,Mark,"The room is comparable to the whole of Stockholm: neat, convenient and lovely. Mr Büsselmann gave me a warm welcome and provided some helpful tourist information. 
Very trustworthy."
3418,608672,16890277,2014-08-04,1356137,Yulia,"Me and my boyfriend had a wonderful time in Stockholm. Karl is a very nice host. He was very kind to help us with orienting around, gave a map and some good advices regarding places to eat. 
The room was small (smaller than it looks on a picture), but nice and clean. Location - just perfect. 
"
3419,608672,17147318,2014-08-08,2579719,Geoff,"We found this a great location - very central but a quiet and attractive neighbourhood. We liked the old, charming, and well maintained Stockholm building that the apartment is in. The main room is a good size. Kitchen and bathroom are small but ok for a short stay. Karl is very nice, was respectful of our privacy and very helpful with local information and suggestions."

Karl even helped us do laundry partway through our stay, and gave us a jar of delicious caviar as a treat. The only challenge was a small shower that required some floor squeegee-ing. Other than that, we had a great stay."
3422,608672,17673301,2014-08-16,13591704,Hester,We got a warm welcome from Karl when we arrived. He gave us some nice information about the city. (We especially liked the boat trip to Vaxholm!) The location is also great! You can walk to the city center. We had enough space for the two of us. Thanks Karl for the nice stay!

Karl was an extremely welcoming host and explained the accommodations upon our arrival. He was easy to communicate with prior to our trip as well. Would definitely recommend Karl's apartment in the future!"
3426,608672,18887225,2014-09-02,18273510,Kate,"Wonderful experience!  Karl was a great host, giving us some good 'insider' tips, providing a map for our usage, and letting us arrive early on a Sunday morning.  The apartment has everything you could need - tea and coffee, hair dryer, and even an iron!  The bed was the comfiest I slept in during my 2-week trip.  Spotlessly clean.  Neighborhood was very cozy and just next to the main shopping drag.  "
3427,608672,19083232,2014-09-06,17562574,Gaurav,Karl was very nice and made us feel comfortable in the new city. Ths house was very conveniently located to tunnel train and just 2 stops from central station or you could even walk to central station. The room was very nice and clean just like the pictures.
3428,608672,19317244,2014-09-10,15424400,Gordon,"Karl provided comprehensive pre-trip information, and a cheerful welcome when we arrived at the apartment. The apartment is ideal if you are looking for a characterful experience of staying in Stockholm for a few days. The shower layout is an interesting novelty, but Karl explained the reason and it just added to the character of staying in an older traditional Stockholm apartment. Location and access to must see attractions is excellent, and overall the accommodation, and amenities contributed towards the enjoyment of our stay. Don't miss out on seeing Stockholm's Town Hall. Very impressive! "
3429,608672,19520631,2014-09-14,18001063,Emma,"My boyfriend and I were in September in Karl's flat. 
We got a kind welcome from Karl, he was very helpful with his explanation of the city and all his recommendations. He was flexible to check in (we arrived at 20.30)
Östermalms Saluhall was amazing!
And.... how many languages do you speak Karl???!!!

The room was nice and clean and with a mini room as a kitchen and useful bathroom even if the shower was not much uncomfortable. There are wifi.

The best advantage of the flat is its localization, very close to the city center, the main commercial street and the central station of Tbane and trains. (10min)

Highly recommended!  
If we will go again to Stockholm, we will repeat!.
Thanks Karl! :)"
3430,608672,19738480,2014-09-17,12199650,Olga,"Great place and great location, we enjoyed our stay indeed! Very quite district but close to the main turistic street, 10 min on walk to the old town. All shops are close, several squares around. Very nice host, thanks to Karl we have visited seafood market with delisious dishes. We stayed very inspired by the city and atmosphere mostly due to the apartment!"
3431,608672,19847405,2014-09-19,3182295,Hendrik,"karl was very kind and took time to introduce me about the neighborhood which is very close located to the main shopping streets . i had a wonderful stay in stockholm. the small flat (not only a room in their flat) is big enough for 2 people, comfy and clean. a small deficit: the shower could be upgraded.  "
3432,608672,20283730,2014-09-27,19190952,Jim,"Karl made me feel very welcome. The room is spacious and very adequate. The location is great...not far from Gamla Stan and 2 blocks from the Radsmangatan metro station. Karl even provided tea bags and instant coffee that I prepared in the little kitchenette. I didn't have a computer, and Karl let me check my email on his next door. The only drawback is the shower, which is almost on top of the toilet. He has a splashboard that doesn't work and the bathroom became a wading pool every time I showered. It was easy enough, though, to mop up with squeegee and dry rags provided. I would highly recommend staying here."
3433,608672,20450610,2014-09-29,9865513,Philly,"Karl was a great host and very helpful, we really enjoyed our stay. The apartment was very clean and cozy- fantastic location you couldn't ask for a more central spot. "
3434,608672,20576318,2014-10-01,10065614,Hoil,"This plat was spacious and cozy and easy to find because it is close to central station. The antique lift/elevator was so impressive and unique experience (it was first time I see. I saw these elevator only in the movie 'Grand Budafest Hotel')

In addition, this plat is totally private becuase it has seperated enterance and shower room.

Karl was so kind person, he was waiting for me until late night even though my flight was arrived at 23:20. In addition, he prepared apples that they harvest at his garden for me!"
3435,608672,20645150,2014-10-03,6610538,Jessica,Karl was a gracious host who gave us a great intro to the city and provided a map. He has some great recommendations for food and sightseeing and went above and beyond with hospitality. The flat is perfect for two people and has a small kitchenette with a refrigerator. Karl was so nice he even left us a welcome gift! Best thing was the bed was very very comfortable! Highly recommend! 
3436,608672,20957078,2014-10-08,17354385,Philippe,"Chambre avec un petit coin cuisine, centrale  et très calme.
Karl est très sympathique et parle français. Ces quelques recommandations sur les lieux à visiter se sont toutes révélées excellentes."
3437,608672,21207889,2014-10-13,1697509,Rosella,"The host is very friendly and supportive. I particularly liked that he speaks even Italian! The room is warm and cosy, the bed comfortable. 
The bathroom and kitchen are very little; cooking should not be planned as you would need to wash your dishes in the bathroom's sink. "
3438,608672,21361972,2014-10-15,22044413,Paraic,Karl was a very welcoming host for my visit to Stockholm. The apartment was located in a beautiful building and was very centrally located. The shower/toilet room was a bit small but other than this I would recommend this room to visitors on a short trip.
3439,608672,21515984,2014-10-19,7972707,Federica,"We stayed at Karl's over the weekend and we had a very pleasant experience, the room is nice and clean with also a small kitchen for breakfast or snacks. The position is fantastic, at walking distance from all main attractions and just behind the main walking shopping street. Karl speaks a perfect Italian since he lived 10 years between Torino and Roma. All in all definitely recommended! Grazie Karl!"
3440,608672,22133365,2014-10-31,2604346,Saher,"Very kind and helpful host. Location perfect, quite central. Space good, all you need for one or two people. Lovely old building."
3441,608672,23439691,2014-12-01,22623945,Bernetta,"Prima verblijf gehad. Van tevoren al spontaan bericht van Karl met routebeschrijving. Hij woont in de flat ernaast, maar er is volledige privacy met eigen ingang. De ruimte is erg schoon en gezellig ingericht. Er is een kleine aparte ruimte met huishoudelijke zaken, zoals koelkastje, kookcomfort, koffiemachine, föhn en strijkplank/strijkijzer. Douche is functioneel. De ontvangst was allerhartelijkst, behulpzaam en informatief. De buurt is rustig en prettig, vlakbij metrostation en op 5 min. van het winkelgebied. Naar Stockholm Centraal Station plm. 15 min lopen. "
3442,608672,23711610,2014-12-08,709767,Robert,Karl's comfortable little apartment was a great place to explore downtown Stockholm from. Just a few steps from the door and i found myself in the middle of the shopping district and a few minutes later I was in the old city. Karl handled all special requests with easy grace and made me feel welcomed. I will definitally be back. 
3443,608672,23823910,2014-12-11,20408400,Nino,"Karl var mycket trevlig och välkomnande, lätt att kommunicera med och gjorde det på alla sätt enkelt och okomplicerat.
Lägenheten är mycket bra på en fantastisk plats, mitt i centrala Stockholm. Kan varmt rekommenderas!"
3444,608672,24021769,2014-12-17,20042267,Tammie,"Our first time using airbnb and we were not disappointed. Karl is very responsive, which was very comforting for being first time visitors of Stockholm. The room was smaller than we were expecting but all we did there was sleep so the room did its job perfectly. If you need to cook something small, all the supplies are there as well. We would definitely stay with Karl again. He was helpful in recommending us a few places to eat and check out, as well as helping us with any laundry confusion. 
The location of our stay was very central, only a 15 minute walk from Central station, and close to all the shopping, along with ostermalm. Highly recommend!"
3445,608672,24064421,2014-12-18,8757367,Gabriel,"Great flat, great host, great location, next to the main shopping street and walking distance to the old town (Gamla Stan), I can strongly recommend this flat to anyone who wants to stay in the city center of Stockholm. I will surely come back again."
3446,608672,25367622,2015-01-13,22451179,Lisa,"Very nice apartment. Even though we arrived late at night (due to the weather conditions) Karl showed us around the apartment and was really kind. The apartment is small but all the essentials are there, it is perfect if you want to visit Stockholm for a few days. "
3447,608672,27320158,2015-03-02,24996136,Douwe,"The apartment is placed in a nice neighborhood, 15 min walk from the central station. The room had enough space and the bed was really soft. The bathroom was fine, but do not expect serious luxury. There is a kitchen included as well, with cook-plates and a microwave. The owner was very friendly and showed us some nice places to go on the map."
3448,608672,28227133,2015-03-20,9405559,Harald,"Meget god beliggenhet. Leilligheten (1 rom) er helt separat fra vertens leillighet, og helt ryddet til bruk som utleierom.
Huseier var tilstede, tok imot og viste rundt effektivt, og mer så jeg ikke til ham - hvilket passet meg utmerket.
Badet er funksjonelt, men litt vanskelig mht dusjen (blir mye vann utover gulvet).
Vil nok bruke denne igjen!

3449,608672,28779075,2015-03-30,574899,Sabine,"Sehr zu empfehlen! Die Lage ist perfekt, man ist in 10 Minuten zu Fuß beim Arlanda Express und die Einkaufsstrasse ist gleich um die Ecke. Das Zimmer ist zwar klein, aber vollkommen ausreichend für ein Wochenende in Stockholm. Karl ist entzückend und sehr hilfsbereit. Außerdem spricht er perfekt deutsch! "

Die Lage ist perfekt in der Nähe einiger netter Restaurants,Bars und Läden. Auch der Rest ist in Gehweite oder super mit der Metro (quasi vor der Haustür) zu erreichen. Das Zimmer war gross genug für uns 2 Cousinen, mit einem gemütlichen Bett. Die Dusche ist nicht top,aber es geht (alles wird etwas nass,trotz der Vorrichtung). Wir haben eine Flasche gekühltes Wasser bekommen, sowie eine Büchse Kaviar :-). Danke Karl für die tollen 2 Tage! "
3452,608672,33803216,2015-06-01,3700717,Nadina,"Karl fue muy amable desde el principio, la comunicación fue excelente, nos dio información precisa para llegar hasta su casa y nos recibió con una sonrisa y muy buena predisposición a pesar de que por el horario del vuelo, llegamos de madrugada. La habitación es tal cual se describe y muy cómoda excepto cuando llega el momento de bañarse, pero vamos, que el resto estuvo muy bien. Lindo barrio, bien comunicado, silencio por la noche. Gracias Karl!"
3453,608672,34397327,2015-06-08,20624617,Carole,"Our host, Karl, was very helpful, giving us lots of information before we arrived and in getting us settled in when we did arrive, and the apartment was just as pictured. The neighborhood was lovely and right near many shops and restaurants; a two block walk led to a beautiful park with fountains and statue of Strindberg. As many reviewers have noted, the shower arrangement in the bathroom is a bit weird, but workable if you don't mind squeegeeing the floor after your shower. I found the very soft, thin mattress very uncomfortable because it offered no back support, but my husband slept just fine. There was instant coffee and tea in the kitchenette, but with terrific cafes so near, we didn't use either. There was a hairdryer provided too, but there was no place to plug it in in the bathroom (and the mirror in there was too high for me to see myself anyway); it could have been plugged in the kitchen, but that had no mirror either. So I ended up drying my hair at the desk in the picture, using the mirror that was about 16 feet away - not a good setup. I'd recommend this accommodation for someone with a good back who doesn't have to use a mirror much. "
3454,608672,34744387,2015-06-11,7637645,Lukas,"I enjoyed my stay in Karl's apartment very much. Karl is a very personable host. He gave me great tips on what to do / see in Stockholm. The apartment is located in a very nice neighborhood, <15 min walk from the main train station and the old city center. It is tiny but cosy and tidy. You will find there everything you need for a short stay in Stockholm."
3455,608672,34931925,2015-06-14,26646657,Ian,"After problems dropping off the hire car it was a relief to be able to walk from the centre of the city to Karl's apartment - the directions he had sent us were spot on.
Karl welcomed us and showed us into the flat, which is next door to his own and proceeded to give us some useful tips about Stockholm in the general and the local area in particular. There is a host of eating and drinking establishments close to the flat and the T-Bana (metro) station was about 2 minutes walk away. Its an ideal location from which to explore the city.
The flat itself is comfortable and remarkable ingenuity has been shown in fitting a shower and kitchen space into the confines of an historic building!"
3456,608672,36418075,2015-06-28,34393500,Alex,"I had a great time staying in Stockholm, Karl made me feel welcome and was very helpful in making my stay as convenient as possible a number of times. The room fit my needs and the neighborhood was very centrally located!"

If I return to Stockholm, I hope to stay here again. "
3459,608672,40686796,2015-08-01,9603194,David,"As many have discovered before me, this is a great place to stay -- good bed, clean, compact, wi-fi and TV, perfectly located in the heart of the city.  To the previous comments, I would add my particular appreciation for the approach to this apartment dating back to 1884 -- either via open cage elevator, or via stone stairs that curve gracefully around it, lighted by windows from an interior courtyard.  The separate entrance from the hallway, shielded by both inner and outer doors, makes me guess this space was once servants' quarters.  The building is located one block from August Strindberg's last residence, and a stay here is like stepping onto the set of one of his plays, or Ibsen's, or Ingmar Bergman's ""Fanny and Alexander.""  How many times can you do that?"
3460,608672,41072343,2015-08-04,30344356,Joëlle,"Accueil très convivial et avec un français parfait. Excellente localisation en plein centre ville. 
En revanche le logement est petit pour un couple et pas fonctiopnnel. Peu de rangement et peu de place pour se remuer. La salle de bain est trop exiguë et la douche très inconfortable. Le coin cuisine aussi est également mal commode. Impossible de laver la vaisselle sinon dans le lavabo dalle de bain et pour remplir une bouteille d'eau, il n'y a que le jet de la douche. Pas de coin pour manger non plus.
Dommage car Karl s'est avéré être un homme très sympathique et de bons conseils."
3461,608672,42387292,2015-08-13,12727110,Kevin,"Appartement fonctionnel et bien situé au centre de stockholm (15 minutes du centre ville). Karl nous a très bien acceuillis et conseillé sur les lieux à visiter.

3462,608672,43602324,2015-08-21,27827920,Chris,"Our host, Karl, was very kind and generous. The apartment is very well-situated, near the Metro station, 2 supermarkets and restaurants. The area is quiet, with the room being on the 3rd floor of a solid older-style apartment building. 
It is a very compact apartment, with a tiny kitchenette that has no running water or sink, which makes washing dishes rather laborious. The bathroom is also very small, with the shower flooding the floor. The bed is comfortable."
3463,608672,44107000,2015-08-24,33381352,Renee,"Modern room with separate pantry and bathroom. It is a typical - small! - city flat. The place is nicely located in the city centre in a quiet street but close to the main street and subway station. Plenty of tourist information available and the fruit that was waiting for us, made us feel welcome. Communication with the owner before our arrival and during our stay was very clear and open. We had a great time in Stockholm!"

3465,608672,45962496,2015-09-07,3906502,Mark,"Karl war sehr nett und hat uns herzlich willkommen geheißen. Da am Tag unserer Ankunft mein Geburtstag war, hatte er uns zwei kleine Flaschen Sekt und etwas schwedischen Kaviar als kleine Aufmerksamkeit organisiert. Das Zimmer selbst ist klein, erfüllt aber seinen Zweck. Das Bett ist weich und bequem, jedoch nichts für Personen die gerne eine harte Matratze mögen. Der kleine TV hat ca 8 Programme, ist jedoch nebensächlich denn Stockholm ist viel zu schön als das man sich mit TV schauen begnügen müsste. Es gibt eine kleine Schrankwand für Klamotten und auf der gegenüberliegenden Seite zwei Herdplatten und einen kleinen Kühlschrank sowie eine Kaffeemaschine (nichts spektakuläres aber es erfüllt alles seinen Zweck). Das Bad ist ebenfalls sehr klein, beim duschen überschwemmt man leider (trotz ""Schutzvorrichtung"") den kleinen Raum, kann den Boden aber mit einem Wischer trocknen. Alles in allem war es sauber. Da man zwei Holztüren zwischen sich und dem Treppenhaus hat, ist er relativ ruhig. Leider konnten wir nicht aus dem Fenster schauen, da das Haus derzeit saniert wird, ansonsten hat es aber keinerlei Einschränkungen gegeben. Die Lage der Wohnung ist top. Man hat in fünf Minuten zu Fuß viele Restaurants und den Beginn der Fußgängerzone. Nach Gamla Stan läuft man ca 15-18 Minuten. "
3466,608672,46712494,2015-09-13,15814939,Carlota,Small appartment very comfortable and nicely located in the city centre. It is located in a quiet street and close to the main street and subway station. Karl was very kind and he gave us a lot of information to visit Stockholm. We had a great time!!
3467,608672,48176330,2015-09-24,38581449,Margo,Karl's apartment was good for a solo traveler. The location was close to public transit and nearby to several restaurants.   Both he and his wife were responsive and communicative and made sure that we connected prior to my arrival. 
3468,608672,48730307,2015-09-28,1305348,Nataly,Karl is a perfect host - he gave me detailed info about the city and let me stay later than the official check out time. The apartment has a very good location - just next to the metro but really you can reach almost all tourist attraction on foot and Stockholm worth it for sure. Apartment is small but cozy. There is a reparation in the building as it is 18th century and window was covered with the paper - but I was coming to the room only to sleep so ho problems. Would definitely come back again! 
3469,608672,49445892,2015-10-04,13254296,Laura,"The communication with Karl before my trip and upon arrival was great, he was very helpful and gave me a few very useful tips. He speaks very good Spanish!
The room/apartment was much better than I expected and was perfect for my intentions: have a place to crash at night. 
The shower is mini, but it is OK, although it is uncomfortable to drain the water after each shower. 
Everything else great: the bed, the kitchenette, the bathroom, there was even a TV! Perfectly located. 
Gracias Karl!

Karl non ha tradito le aspettative e si è dimostrato molto gentile e disponibile. Siamo arrivati a Stoccolma verso mezzanotte e mezza, da T Central basta percorrere 10 minuti a piedi Drottningattan, la via pedonale dello shopping, e si arriva all'appartamento. Karl ci ha accolti mostrandoci l'appartamento e ci ha consigliato cosa vedere a Stoccolma.
Sapevamo che a Stoccolma gli spazi abitativi sono molto piccoli, ma daltronde l'alloggio serve per dormire e usare il bagno. Il letto è a una piazza e mezza abbondante, comodo. Il cucinino ha un fornello elettrico e un forno a microonde, adatto per prepararsi una colazione veloce (noi l'abbiamo usufruito solo per bere un the). A disposizione degli ospiti si trova caffè solubile, the, e vettovaglie per prima colazione.
Il bagno è pulito. Unica nota dolente: manca un vero e proprio piatto doccia (una volta lavati bisogna asciugare, il pavimento però rende l'operazione veloce e semplice). A disposizione degli ospiti la WI-FI.
Nel complesso possiamo dire che l'appartamento è perfetto per una breve vacanza e Karl è super disponibile ad aiutare gli ospiti per ogni loro richiesta.

Karl is very friendly and helpful. We arrived in Stockholm at half past midnight, from T Central just walk 10 minutes on Drottningattan street, one of main pedestrian shopping street.
Karl met us showing us the apartment. He tell us some information about Stockholm.
In Stockholm living spaces are very small. The bed is comfortable. The kitchen has an electric cooker and a microwave oven, suitable to prepare a quick breakfast (we benefited only to drink a cup of tea). Guests will find instant coffee, tea, and provisions for breakfast.
The bathroom is clean, but there isn't a shower box, so after shower you have to dry it. By the way this operation is fast and simple.
Free WI-FI is included.
The apartment is perfect for a short break and Karl is super helpful to assist guests with their every request."

3483,608672,55560156,2015-12-02,19675635,Dorothy,"The host Karl was brilliant, very accommodating and friendly and even helped us print some tickets out.

The room was smaller then it looked on the pictures but was an ok size, the kitchen was tiny and did not have any running water (taps) and wouldn't really suffice as a kitchen had we needed to cook anything.

The bathroom again was ok, small the downside was the shower - Karl mentioned he was trying to get permission to change the draining. 
The shower is a temporary add on and extremely cramped - also floods the whole bathroom.

Location of this flat is brilliant, extremely central and easily walk able to a lot of main tourist destinations. "
3484,608672,55791414,2015-12-06,33134893,Luciano,Very friendly hosts with a very nice room located in a perfect spot of Stockholm. We definitely would book it again!
3485,608672,56181556,2015-12-10,14768801,Lorri And Bill,"Karl's pre trip communication helpful as was when he provided a key to the flat  He also provided some insight/recommendations for places to see and eat. The location is pretty good;  10 minutes from bus or train stations,  near shopping,  old city,  ferries are all 20 to 30 minutes away by foot. 
The place is very, very basic. 
The only issue was the bathroom. The place was built in the late 1890s or so so there are limits to any renovation you can do. The place is an ""apartment"" only because it has a separate entry way from the main suite (the doors to the main suite in the place still exist) to the main foyer entry.   It is a one room--former bedroom-- place with a two piece bath and a poorly designed third piece as a ""shower""  which is not enclosed in the bathroom. This is not uncommon however the bathroom floor ends up with water standing on the floor as the drain top sits above the floor/water level. These means you need to squeegee the water off the floor and into the drain every time you shower or you step in water every time you go into the bathroom. 
The closet hasthe coffee maker, 2 burner hot plate,  microwave and small refrigerator one on top of another. While convenient on one hand,  could be dangerous in another. 
Despite these items, it is an acceptable place for one person. I, personally, would not have 2 persons here due to the limited space available. "
3486,608672,59909487,2016-01-17,17109389,Rebecca,"Karl welcomed me a little earlier than we agreed which was great as I was tired after a long day. He took the time to show me around the apartment and suggest a few places to eat. The space itself is clean, modern and fine for 1 person or a couple.  It is located on a quiet street right near the shopping district and is fairly close to many popular places; it is a 15-20 minute walk to the old town and 10 minutes walk from the airport shuttle. The only downside is the shower which is in a small bathroom with no screen or bath so water goes all over the floor. The water didn't drain properly, but when I left Karl said the drain was blocked & he had fixed it. If you like a long shower then this isn't the place for you. Karl looked after my luggage for me after I checked out which was very sweet. I would stay here again. Thanks."

I had a late flight back to London and Karl kindly allowed me to leave his flat at the time that was mostly convenient to me. The apartment is extremely central, 5-10 minute walk from the train station, loads of shops, restaurants and coffee shops just round the corner from the apartment.

3495,608672,63724343,2016-02-26,877316,Fran,"Karl was great host and he gave us excellent advice regarding Stockholm. The apartment is in an excellent location, main street being 2 minutes walk away.

Only thing you need to get used to is the scandinavic shower, but Karl said he's in the process of putting a new, ""classic"", one, and that would make the apartment even better!"
3496,608672,65232140,2016-03-12,42849164,Esteban,"The apartment is central, quiet and clean . Karl met me at the right time and place, the whole trip was a triple AAA.
thank you Karl, any time again."
3497,608672,66071989,2016-03-19,31810654,Jenny,"Karl was extremely welcoming and kind. We arrived at around 1AM and Karl stayed up in order to greet us and show us around the apartment. Although the flat is very small, it is a great and intimate space for 1 or 2 people, like advertised. The bathroom, of course, is inconvenient since there is no separated area for the shower. He did say that it was getting renovated so I do hope that this will be better for future guests."
3498,608672,66858706,2016-03-25,64010748,Michael,"Very nice flat, great host, superb location! A little small but the price is very fair for the size. Highly recommended if you just need a small room to sleep and maybe do some work (there is a comfortable desk and chair and internet) for a few days. The kitchen is basic but clean!"
3499,608672,66994515,2016-03-26,31077844,Key,"Karl's home is well located and very convenient. Besides, Karl is very nice that he offered us early check in in the morning and he has introduced us the local fish market and area for sightseeing which we really loved so much!"
3500,608672,69193287,2016-04-10,49337547,Vanda,"We really loved our stay at Karl's studio flat. Karl has been an excellent host. He showed us around the studio flat, provided extra towels for our little one and was very friendly and helpful. The studio flat itself was clean and comfortable and its location superb as it's literally in the heart of Stockholm. Highly recommended!"
3501,608672,69735730,2016-04-13,2055118,Lisa,"Mark stayed with Karl whilst on a work trip - Mark's feedback was as follows: Perfect location, informative host, perfect for a quick trip! 

"
3502,608672,70229460,2016-04-17,21929747,Alice,"We passed an excellent week-end to Stockholm. The flat of Karl is perfect for one person or a couple. It is situanted in very good area, we did not use the transport at all. We discoverd the city by foot. Karl is  kindly and prevenant host. He advice us a pub with live jazy soul music (the stampen) and we passed a pretty night. 
NB: Karl parle très bien français ! 
Alice & Clement "
3503,608672,73858279,2016-05-10,17120670,Gunnar,"Perfect host & nice location! 
I would recommend it to anyone looking for a central apartment in Stockholm.."
3504,608672,73973718,2016-05-12,8757367,Gabriel,"Great flat, great host, great location, next to the main shopping street and walking distance to the lovely Old Town, I can't recommend this flat strongly enough to all visiting Stockholm and want to stay in the city centre really close to so many restaurant, shops, bars and entertainment. This was my second stay here and going to Stockholm I would never stay anywhere else, highly recommended!"
3505,608672,74701848,2016-05-16,37876074,Petra,"Karl er frábær gestjafi. Tók á móti okkur og leiðbeindi með samgöngur.Leiðarlysingar mjög réttar og þægilegar.
Íbúðin mjög lítin en passar frábær staðsetning ."
3506,608672,75134834,2016-05-19,17826958,Evis,"The flat is centrally located, walking distance or two short stops by train. Karl's wife greeted us and showed us the room. She also bought my girlfriend flowers for her birthday. Overall great experience, only the bathroom needs fixing as it is stated in other reviews. "
3507,608672,77776048,2016-06-03,13914571,Brita,"Lovely little flat in an excellent location in Stockholm. Really close to the Rådmasgatan T station on the green line as well as several supermarkets, pubs, coffee shops, and restaurants. Karl was welcoming and kind. There were only two minor inconveniences (which were not a big deal and I guess I wasn't paying great attention to the pictures): one was that the little kitchenette had no sink and the second was that the shower is constructed without a floor that slopes down to the drain, so you have to use a window scraper to get the water off of the floor and into the drain (the curtain doesn't really stretch, so it doesn't give much coverage). I only stayed 2 nights, so these factors were not a huge inconvenience. The other thing is that I wish I had been notified that there would be construction going on in the building (the hammering on the landing started at around 7:30 am each morning). Again, not a deal breaker, just wish I had been able to take into consideration when choosing where to stay. 

Overall, comfortable bed, lovely location, but with a few inconveniences and slow wifi."
3508,608672,79904764,2016-06-14,2933063,Dalia,"L'appartamento si trova in una zona centrale e ben servita. Karl, il proprietario, parla un ottimo italiano ed è stato molto gentile e disponibile, fornendoci anche informazioni su come muoverci e cosa fare  in città. L'appartamento è costituito da una stanza con letto matrimoniale, scrivania e poltroncina, un bagnetto e un piccolo locale adibito a cucina. Qui non è possibile cucinare, ma sono presenti un frigo, una caffetteria e un microonde. Unica nota il bagno, la doccia da direttamente sul lavandino ed è praticamente impossibile non allagare tutto. Karl ci ha tuttavia informato che a breve (l'edificio è piuttosto antico e per fare lavoretti di ammodernamento deve aspettare le necessarie autorizzazioni) il bagno sarà rifatto e la doccia sarà spostata dalla posizione attuale."
3509,608672,80279966,2016-06-17,15209760,Matthew,"Karl greeted me as soon as the lift arrived at his floor (even though I was somewhat early). He is very nice and helpful. The listing is accurate, but perhaps doesn't capture the charm of this small flat with its high ceilings and plaster moldings. The shower is slightly awkward to operate, especially for Americans who are accustomed to a distinct shower stall, but this is a minor issue. The neighborhood, despite being ""in"" central Stockholm, is quiet and in every sense perfect, which makes walking in any direction incredibly convenient."
3510,608672,80722207,2016-06-19,7884982,Catherine,The host was easy to reach by e-mail and greeted us when we arrived. He lives in the adjacent apartment. The location is great. We had nice restaurants and parks nearby without being in a tourist area. We were able to walk everywhere that we wanted to go. The bed was comfortable.
3511,608672,81416815,2016-06-22,12966277,Mary,"Karl was extremely helpful from the time of booking onwards. Although the flat is small it was cosy and very convenient.  The shower was a slightly unusual arrangement but there was plenty of hot water.  The kitchenette had enough equipment  for making  a simple meal, and there was a supermarket - and wine store - very close. We needed to wash done clothes and were able to use the communal washing machine and dryer. It is best to ask Karl in advance though as the residents have to book a slot for the use of the machine."
3512,608672,81729508,2016-06-24,9246803,Brittany,"Although my stay here was short, I enjoyed it very much. Karl was an extremely welcoming host. Even when I got lost after a very long day of traveling and was a few hours late to check-in, he came outside to meet me and took my suitcase (which was broken) up to the studio. The apartment was clean and cozy, and the neighborhood was beautiful, quiet, and as the listing mentions, in a great location!"
3513,608672,82091096,2016-06-26,32187981,Anders,"Karl's instructions for getting to the house were perfect and having multiple options to choose from was nice so we didn't have to depend on one option.

Karl was available upon arrival for a walkthrough of the flat to get us acclimated, even though we arrived late in the evening. 

The flat was clean, comfortable, quiet and in a nice neighbourhood within walking distance to most anything in the city. Would definitely stay here again on another trip to Stockholm!"
3514,608672,84141397,2016-07-05,17110254,Sabrina,"L'accoglienza di Karl è stato quanto di meglio ci si possa augurare. é stato molto gentile e disponibile, dandoci un sacco di informazioni utili per il nostro soggiorno."
3515,608672,84727215,2016-07-08,7677480,Viva,"Great location, Karl was very nice.  "
3516,608672,85230447,2016-07-10,48971137,Harriet,"Very lovely little studio flat. Good sized bedroom with a shower room and small kitchenette in excellent location close to city centre and shops. Karl was very good at communicating with us beforehand and arrival on the day was easy. Flat is clean, nicely decorated and well equipped. Items such as shampoo, hairdryer, fridge and microwave were very useful but kitchen not really suitable for making anything substantial. 

Only suggestion I would make is that the shower doesn't really work too well. It is a wet room but the water goes everywhere and is a bit difficult to properly shower.  However, we were only staying for a couple of nights so wasn't too much of an issue. "
3517,608672,85964074,2016-07-14,5304982,Florian,"Karl's apartment is located in the middle of Stockholms heart. Only one street away from the main shopping street and 10 minutes walking from the central station.
The communication with Karl was very good. He answered fast. After our arriving, he explained us every thing which we needed to know about the place. Furthermore, Karl gave us a map and a short introduction about where to find what in Stockholm.
The apartment is very simple and smaller than it looks on the pictures. The ""kitchen"" has a small fridge, a microwave, coffee machine and two hotplates - But no sink. The dishes must be made in the tiny sink in the bathroom. Another thing missing is a place to eat. There is a table, but it's more like a working desk and not ideal to eat.
The bathroom is also very small and there is no real shower in it. When showering the whole floor is under water since there is only a curtain.
The apartment offers wifi - the signal isn't very good though. And on our stay it didn't work properly.
All in all it's a good location for a weekend but it's quite expensive even it's good located. 

One week before our arrival, Karl sent us the directions to find the appartment and some more information. He also wrote that there were ongoing constructions on the house during our stay. We really appriciated his honesty, but didn't expected the noise at 7am."
3518,608672,87060421,2016-07-18,29224394,Lewis,"Nice friendly helpful host. Clean and tidy apartment in a lovely building with all the necessary amenities. The location is excellent within walking distance to old town and main shopping area, and Rådmansgatan train station is only a few minutes away. Wireless internet was also perfect.
Karl lives right next door, which makes it easy to attend to any issues or queries.
See you next time! "
3519,608672,88177402,2016-07-23,12891292,Maria Vittoria,"Lo studio è situato in una posizione strategica e comoda a vari servizi  (locali, supermercato e fermata del metro vicini), raggiungibile anche a piedi dalla stazione e dal centro di Stoccolma. E' composto da una camera luminosa e arredata con gusto, bagno e una piccola cucina per pasti veloci; perfetto per una persona o per una coppia. 
Abbiamo trascorso una piacevole vacanza a Stoccolma anche grazie all'ottima sistemazione e alla gentilezza dell'ospite. Karl è infatti una persona molto cordiale e disponibile, sempre pronta a darci consigli per visite alla città e ""gite fuori porta"" e ad aiutare in caso di necessità (ho avuto bisogno di consultare un medico per un piccolo incidente e Karl mi ha indicato come procedere e a chi rivolgermi). 
Una sistemazione che consiglio a chiunque sia alla ricerca di un alloggio comodo e confortevole per soggiornare nella splendida Stoccolma. "
3520,608672,89067116,2016-07-26,64320966,Silka,Easy and uncomplicated Check-In. Karl is very helpful and active in making you feel at home. The location of the flat is central and everything lies within walking distance. Thank you very much! It has been a great stay.
3521,608672,90260063,2016-07-31,75375809,Katie,"Karl was available prior to arrive for any questions and very attentive to email if I had any questions during my stay. The room itself is completely private and provides a really nice experience. It is also in the most beautiful part of town and couldn't be more centrally located. Fantastic place to stay. At the beginning of the stay, Karl mentioned he is in the process of securing a permit to install a real shower cab. As it stands the shower situation is quite a hassle. Due to a ineffective shower curtain and water barrier, water truly goes all over the bathroom floor. Once the shower cab is installed, this listing will be flawless. "
3522,608672,90909010,2016-08-02,29024212,Angela,"Karl met us when we arrived.  He lives next door so communication and receiving keys is easy.  Everything we needed was provided, and the room was very nice, in a beautiful historic building, in a convenient location.  Close to the metro, close to shopping and there is a grocery store and systembologet very close by.  We walked everywhere from here, and it was wonderful.  So quiet at night, too!  We were able to leave the windows open without any worry for noise.  Thank you, Karl!"
3523,608672,93013610,2016-08-11,54372170,Théo,"Nice room in a great location, close to everything you need but you'll need to take the metro for the old city or other monuments. 
There was no real shower and no possibility to cook which is a bit of a let down but otherwise the bed is great and to room very nice. 
Karl was there to greet me and was very nice as well. 
I would really recommend it for a short trip !"
3524,608672,93404249,2016-08-12,30763489,Anne-Flore,"We stayed at Karl's flat during two nights. It was a really nice stay. He was very welcoming and he gave us a lot of good indications for our short stay. The place was really clean, everything that we could need was there. It's close to central station and to the old city so if you don't want to take the metro during your stay this is the place to be.
We would go there again if we get the chance to go again in Stockholm.
Thank you for everything Karl. :)
Ps: for the French people, malgré ce que peut dire Karl, il parle très très bien français !"
3525,608672,95029079,2016-08-18,66032854,Frank,Jättetrevligt boende. Bra bemötande och Karl gav goda tips på aktiviteter i Stockholm. Boendet var mycket mysigt och absolut perfekt vid en visit till huvudstaden. Toppbetyg från oss!
3526,608672,96111056,2016-08-21,62506005,Rachel,"Karl was extremely welcoming, showing me around the space and also key places on the map. The flat is in a short walking distance of the centre and the neighbourhood was quiet.
Overall a good place to stay - however if you are hoping to make any food, the kitchenette is basic with no sink and no surface to prepare food (I used the desk in the bedroom). Also Karl mentioned he is hoping to install a shower cubicle which will be a great addition as currently the arrangement means the bathroom floor gets a bit like a swimming pool when you use the shower."
3527,608672,96887784,2016-08-24,14206112,Emilie,"Karl été très accueillant. Nous avons communiqué facilement avant le séjour, il a été arrangeant pour accommoder nos horaires. Il répondait très vite aux emails et a facilité nos changements de programme. Le studio est propre et fonctionnel. La douche n'est pas très pratique, mais pour un court séjour ça va. Le quartier est formidable, l'emplacement du studio est idéal, à 15 minutes à pied de la gare et 20 minutes du centre ville en passant par des rues piétonnes et commerçantes."
3528,608672,98170648,2016-08-29,10088813,Charles,The studio is in a great location.  It was easy to get around the city using public transit.  There were food stores and restaurant nearby.  Karl is an excellent host and spent time telling about the studio and answering questions.  It quickly fixed an item that broke ... we told him about it in a morning email and it was fixed when we returned from a day of sightseeing.
3529,608672,98693485,2016-09-01,63337684,Marie,Rent och snyggt. Bra kommunikationer. Trevligt mottagande. 
3530,608672,99458358,2016-09-04,6270976,Nicole,"After a 10min walk from the Arlanda Express train-station we received a warm welcome from Karl. He explained everything, handed us over a city map, provided us with water and was here for further questions. 
He lives next door and is available if you've got any inquiries. 
The flat is located in a very quiet area where you feel safe (as well during night times). 
There are several brekky places within 5min walking distance and the pedestrian street Trottninggatan is only a stone's throw away. You can reach Gamla Stan (the old town) by foot within approx. 30min. 

The flat is perfect for a longer weekend stay with your friend or partner. It's quite small but everything fits in and you feel very cozy and welcome. 
We would definitely recommend this place and would go there again!

"
3531,608672,100516447,2016-09-09,66214810,Corinna,"Die Lage des Appartements ist super central. Wer gern zu Fuss unterwegs ist erreicht alles ohne die Bahn zu benutzen. Das Haus in dem die Wohnung ist gefällt mir sehr gut. Es war sauber und ordentlich. Der Kontakt zu Karl war freundlich und hilfsbereit. Die Waschmaschine konnte ohne Probleme verwendet werden. Es ist etwas hellhörig. Die Bettmatratze ist für mich persönlich schon etwas zu weich eingelegen. Die Küche eignet sich wirklich nur für kleine unkomplizierte Snacks, da im Bad abgewaschen werden muss und ein Esstisch fehlt. Würde die Unterkunft wieder buchen. Vielen Dank."
3532,608672,102102085,2016-09-16,10966302,Adam,My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Karl met us personally and gave us a tour of our room as well as well as discussed the city.  He let us know how to contact him should we need anything. Great location to shopping and fabulous restaurants.  
3533,608672,102969517,2016-09-19,32314999,Kate,Great studio flat in a good location for exploring Stockholm. Everything walkable but hiring the city bikes made for a cool mode of transport! Karl was really helpful - recommended. 
3534,608672,103348296,2016-09-22,80124619,Nora,"Depto bien ubicado, cerca de la calle peatonal y de restaurantes abiertos a toda hora.  Muy atento el anfitrión y recomendó lugares para visitar.  Sin bien es pequeño el estudio es cómodo para poco tiempo.  La ducha no es tan cómoda pero asegura que va a solucionarlo."
3535,608672,104914884,2016-09-29,10911570,Ilan,Great and very central location. Karl J. provided explanations and give all the information you may need. Highly recommended!
3536,608672,105423202,2016-10-01,64491924,祐進,"Karl很親切,房源很接近地鐵站,房間設備齊全｡最重要的是有電梯,住在歷史200年的房子裡,很特別的體驗｡"
3537,608672,106240151,2016-10-05,45815494,Karen,The bed was comfortable a d the building was very cool and in a great part of town.
3538,608672,106852580,2016-10-08,18904818,Adrian,"Karl received us upon our arrival and gave us a very good orientation of Stockholm and the popular sights. He also gave us a map with the popular sights marked out.

As we rented a car during our stay, Karl also patiently brought us around the neighbourhood to explain how the parking system works in Stockholm and where we can park, as we do not understand the Swedish language. 

We were intrigued by how the lift system works in the old building - something we don't have in our country anymore!

As we had 2 huge luggages, the space was a big tight for us. However, the location of the apartment made up for everything!! the shopping district was nearby - probably just 2 streets away.

 Karl was a great host and we had a great experience!

 "
3539,608672,107370142,2016-10-10,84176903,Jamison,Karl was a very gracious host and everything was exactly as advertised.  The location is perfect for exploring Stockholm.
3540,608672,107859583,2016-10-12,20587773,Aaron,"Upon arrival Karl found me outside due to the door not working for me. Very nice looking out for me.  
Once inside the appartment was very nice and Karl showed me a map of things to see and do. 
The bed was very comfy and place was quite. 
Close walking distance to everything. "
3541,608672,108947711,2016-10-18,26615082,Gehan,"Karl is such a lovely host and an excellent communicator who would go out of his way to help you, the location of the room is second to none and we couldn't have found a better spot, we needed an iron and Karl was great in providing us with one asap. my only comments would be the size of the room and the bathroom.

The room is small so if you are traveling with someone you don't know well then it's not the one for you. It's a small room and not a studio which makes it cosy.

The toilet is very small and doesn't have a shower space, there is a metal provider which you can use to limit the water going everywhere but sadly it's not the most efficient and you still end up with a very wet toilet floor which you would need to sweep using a small hand sweeper which means you have to bend to sweep the floor which was difficult for me as I have a bad back. 

The building is an amazing building from 1930s I believe but this means that the drains are not the best which translated into our room constantly smelling badly from the toilet drains. "
3542,608672,109189742,2016-10-20,18315931,Shweta,"Karl was a lovely host and recommended some spots to visit. The apartment was lovely, clean and cosy. The bathroom was small and the shower needed work but Karl explained the situation and will be fixing it in the near future. I will recommend Karl's apartment to my friends should they visit Stockholm."
3543,608672,109571017,2016-10-22,64417116,Jacob,"Excellent location! Walking distance to everything, great communication and great person, recommended!"
3544,608672,110283720,2016-10-25,10976863,Mimi,Karl was great! He was waiting outside of the elevator when we arrived to let us in to the apartment. He also took the time to tell us somethings that we should see and do and also help us figure out how to get there! The apartment is tiny and cute with a great location!! Perfect for 1-2 people. Easily walked everywhere we needed to go.
3545,608672,111365968,2016-10-30,59479662,Steven,It Is the first time for me to stay in a historical building with over 100years. Nice location but the bathroom is too small without a standard shower space. 
3546,608672,112007546,2016-11-03,55690420,Mairéad,Very centrally located! We were two students traveling on break and it was the perfect size for us. Bathroom is a wet room but Karl has a great set up so you don't flood the place. Little fridge and coffee station as well. Great building!
3547,608672,112876889,2016-11-08,93169188,Jonas,"Karl was a very nice and helpful host. He even texted us that it was possible to check in before the usual check in time, which was just what we had hoped for and he have us a warm welcome! We stayed in his place for three nights during our Stockholm city trip. The apartment is small and cozy and the even though the shower is a little ""old fashioned"" we were totally satisfied with this accommodation. The building is very old, has high ceilings, an  old elevator and is just beautiful. The distance to the tunnelbana and the city center couldn't have been better and we can definitely recommend everyone to stay at Karl's apartment!"
3548,608672,113593160,2016-11-13,8273690,Maxime,Karl était très disponible avant l'arrivée et nous a bien aidé pour préparer notre venue 
3549,608672,114525124,2016-11-19,21535366,Eka,"Friendly, welcoming and caring host. 
Wonderful location, where public transportation, convenience stores and shopping outlets are just within walking distance.

Welcoming and warmhearted host
Historic and cozy home
Great location
What's more
clean, safe and warm.

All in all, I had a pleasant stay for my first visit to Stockholm."
3550,608672,115263428,2016-11-23,22881983,Sophie,"It was a very cozy apartment in a beautiful old building, and convenient as it was close to everything. Karl was very helpful with everything. Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
3551,608672,115505562,2016-11-25,18328415,Suzanna,Karl was very welcoming and the place is very cozy with a super comfy bed (great pillows!). It's in a beautiful historic building and in a quiet residential area that is convenient to everything you want to be close to in Stkhlm. The listing didn't indicate that the washer/dryer had to be reserved in advance (it does!) but thankfully Karl and his wife had a reservation for the next morning and he kindly let us use some of that time and helped with using the machines. It would've been nice to have a non-caffeinated tea option (or just anything other than Earl Grey). I didn't mind being able to hear sounds and smells of the kitchen from his flat but the cigarette smell REALLY bothered me. :/
3552,608672,116142663,2016-11-28,81314422,Maud,Appartement idéalement situé à Stockholm cœur de la ville. Quartier et immeuble de standing. Chambre petite mais avec le confort nécessaire pour un séjour de quelques jours. La douche en revanche doit être refaite. Karl est un hôte fort sympatique qui nous a donné des conseils sur les visites et des plans pour manger... 
3553,608672,116520156,2016-12-01,26141252,Claire,Great place to stay if you're there to explore the city. Very central and only a 2 minute walk to the main shopping street. Karl was welcoming and very helpful with any questions we had about getting around. Highly recommend!!
3554,608672,117288637,2016-12-06,37871251,Alex,"房東非常友善及盡責, 在我們準備前已主動聯絡我們, 提供交通安排上的協助, 入住時親身介紹房子及周邊景點. 由於前一天並沒有租出房子, 房東協助安排提早入住, 太貼心了. 房子在一棟歷史建築中, 很有氣氛. 房子乾淨而整潔, 設備齊全. 就是WIFI弱了點及浴室比較小."
3555,608672,120286437,2016-12-09,8786155,Colette,Karl was a thoroughly lovely host.
3556,608672,120574779,2016-12-11,27709745,Gilbert,"The place is convenient for 1 or 2 people and the location was AMAZING. We managed to walk everywhere. Very well heated place even when it was snowing outside which was PERFECT, and Karl was such a lovely host, very welcoming and extremely friendly. We will surely be back. Thank you :)"
3557,608672,121107017,2016-12-14,2531458,Tom,"Karl was a very friendly and helpful host. The apartment was small but very clean and central, easily in walking distance to all the sights. Only negative was the shower, which was a little basic, but the listing was good value and well recommended."
3558,608672,121451454,2016-12-17,98593966,Daniel,Rekommenderas om man vill bo centralt
3559,608672,122210987,2016-12-21,52273388,Katie,"Our host Karl was wonderful! He was very quick to respond to any questions we had leading up to our stay and throughout our stay as well. Very accomodating, well heated and equipped with complimentary coffee/tea. Cozy apartment for 1-2 persons. Karl answered had excellent english (helpful for we are Australian and spoke next to no Swedish!) all of our questions about the area and Stockholm itself, also provided us with a map. In a great location so close to shops and walking distance to Gamla Stan, and the building is with lift. Would recommend! "
3560,608672,124541478,2017-01-02,95832761,Olivier,"Il n'y pas vraiment de baignoire ou de bac à douche. L'évacuation de l'eau se fait à même le sol. À part ce petit défaut, l'appartement est idéalement situé, Karl et sa compagne sont chaleureux et disponibles. Nous avons passé un excellent week-end."
3561,608672,125358861,2017-01-05,12250342,HaoWei,"Karl and his wife are very nice. They introduced everything about the apartment and would like to help you. The apartment is cozy. It is in the center of the city, near the subway. I would like to recommend everyone to live here."
3562,608672,126376113,2017-01-11,23148285,Freefish,"We had a lovely stay at Karl’s place in Stockholm. The location is perfect and very close to everywhere you need to go. It’s just minutes’ walk to the central station where you can find an amazing food hall!
The apartment is very cozy and inside a lovely traditional Swedish building. Karl was away while we were there but his wife Karin took good care of us!
We would recommend this place to everyone who is visiting Stockholm."
3563,608672,126731184,2017-01-14,22802177,Lucero,Everything was just as listed. Close to everything the apartment was perfectly located. Karl and his wife were super friendly and thoughtful. Would love to come back! 
3564,608672,127415901,2017-01-18,16880500,Keith,The temperature of the apt was just right...and the bed was very comfortable.  If I ever get back to Stockholm I will stay at Karls for sure!
3565,608672,127679429,2017-01-20,68612540,David,"Awesome place! 
Awesome guest! 
Totally worth it, we will come back next year! Counting the days"
3566,608672,128514829,2017-01-25,100643488,Sue,Karl was really nice :)
3567,608672,130664013,2017-02-07,46031125,Todd,Karl's place was perfect for a week long stay for one or two people. Very central location in a gorgeous old building. Karl was incredibly helpful when I arrived as well. I definitely hope to stay here again next time I visit Stockholm 
3568,608672,130894857,2017-02-09,6393010,Kelly,"Very well located. Clean, warm and cosy place. Karl was very welcoming and gave us a map of interest."
3569,608672,131428311,2017-02-12,63456482,Yura,"Un alojamiento centrico y accesible a pie a casi cualquier parte de la ciudad. Paradas de autobuses y metro muy cercanos. El apartamento  pequeño pero acogedor. Quizá la única pega es la ducha debido a que teóricamente no existe y la solución encontrada no es del todo práctica. Una nota final de 7,5. "
3570,608672,132998752,2017-02-20,81400693,Agota,"Excellent location, walking distance to local shop, underground, city centre. Good value for money. Clean place and everything up to standards. "
3571,608672,133558624,2017-02-23,41166872,Naomi,"Karl's place was clean and very centrally located. We were within a 5 minute walk from the closest metro station with tons of shops, restaurants, and bakeries on the way. Karl was helpful and answered all of our questions. Great communication before check-in as well. The place is perfect for one person but can be a bit crowded for two. The shower and the toilet are not separated so guests need to clean up the water after a shower or the bathroom will be wet. It wasn't an issue, just took us a while to get used to. We just needed a place to sleep and this was the perfect location. "
3572,608672,133846691,2017-02-25,43639681,Stephanie,"Karl's place is located at a beautiful old building which is awesome! The apartment is convenient and within walkable distance to many attractions. Karl is a great host, nice, friendly and helpful. We had a wonderful stay at Karl's place as well as Stockholm!"
3573,608672,134827727,2017-03-01,13223131,Jean,Very clean well located! I recommend it
3574,608672,135072672,2017-03-03,22449455,Amy,"Karl was fantastic! Extremely helpful-- a perfect host. 

The space was smaller than I thought. But that doesn't matter when you're out all day anyway. 

The shower is the only issue I had. It's not a ""real"" shower, but a hose connected to the wall in the bathroom. There was a metal barrier provided that would contain the water. But it didn't work well so most days our bathroom flooded and we'd have to squeegee it out. 

*Also, the bathroom smelled heavily of smoke. Just the bathroom, though. "
3575,608672,135793428,2017-03-06,31462420,Pramis,"Karl was very communicative & helpful host. He explained places worth to visit and he also helped us getting the boarding passes printed.

The premises itself was super cosy & well-located in the city-centre; near public transports and main shopping & cafés boulevard in Stockholm. 

Really look forward to come back & stay in his apartment soon!"
3576,608672,136522082,2017-03-11,90159928,Yoshi,Nice location to access the central areas. A metro station was within 5 min walk.
3577,608672,137256710,2017-03-14,116116187,Nicole,"Karl's wife had greeted us and given the keys; she was very friendly, extremely welcoming, and willing to answer any questions. The location is close to one of the train stops and very good bars are all within walking distance. Karl has Stockholm travel information in the desk drawers, at your convenience. Great stay and right in City Center. Would definitely recommend this place!"
3578,608672,141188107,2017-04-02,39224468,Elodie,"• Ideal location in the centre, close to everything. 
• Beautiful building. 
• Small but practical room - tiny drawback regarding the shower being not very practical but still alright. 
• Karl's absolutely lovely and super flexible. 
• Highly recommend. 
"
3579,608672,143540974,2017-04-12,6768383,Jarrett,Karl's apartment was in a great location and he provided everything needed. Thanks!
3580,608672,144596205,2017-04-16,12763192,Katie,"Great location for a short stay in Stockholm. Easy to walk to all attractions and plenty of shops, restaurants and bars around. Good communication from Karl, gave us lots of advice on what to do. Would highly recommend. "
3581,608672,145387924,2017-04-18,32706575,Chel,Karl's place was exactly as advertised. He was very easy to communicate with and gave me detailed instructions on how to get to his flat from the airport. Very clean and cozy place. Very close to the main pedestrian street but just separated enough for quiet at night. I would definitely stay again. 
3582,608672,146018170,2017-04-21,103848424,Elena,"Very good position, only 10 minutes by walking to reach the central station. The apartment is cozy and comfortable. It has all the necessary, also a very useful kitchen. The shower is pretty problematic because it is opened.
The host is willing, friendly and speaks Italian fluently. I would really recommend this place. "
3583,608672,146897011,2017-04-24,110657795,Balázs,"Great location, good communication and hospitality."
3584,608672,147914964,2017-04-29,108232431,Anne,"Karl est très accueillant et parle très bien français . L'appartement est idéalement situé près du centre et de la grande rue piétonne. Seul petit bémol, la douche mais Karl attend l'autorisation de faire des travaux dans cet appartement classé."
3585,608672,148669382,2017-05-01,123486108,Denise,"Super Unterkunft und nur zu empfehlen! Die Wohnung ist mit Liebe eingerichtet, es ist alles da, was man braucht und die Lage ist perfekt (alles ist zu Fuß erreichbar). Ich würde die Unterkunft jederzeit wieder buchen!"
3586,608672,149406902,2017-05-04,1579177,Jill,Best thing about this studio is the location - it's walkable to everything we wanted to do/see/eat in Stockholm. Neighborhood is lovely. Karl was accommodating and communication was easy and quick. Karl has plans to expand the bathroom to include a full shower cabinet which will be a nice improvement. Highly recommended!
3587,608672,150443216,2017-05-08,79077674,Shaun,Located in a great location to be able to explore central Stockholm. Close to just about everything. Bathroom/shower were a bit small and took some getting used to. 
3588,608672,150940933,2017-05-10,36269047,Cameron,"Karl's place was very well located a few blocks off the main pedestrian-only shopping street. It allowed easy access to the main city and old town, while being tucked away from any noise. 

The apartment was very clean and the bed is very comfortable. Karl was very helpful in explaining the metro and how to get around. We appreciate him being flexible with our checkout time, though it is important to note that there was no other guests arriving on our checkout day. Nonetheless, it was very nice of him to allow us a few extra hours before our flight. 

The shower, as Karl explained, is a little unconventional - and historic building codes prevent him from updating it - but it is hot and works well. All in all it was very enjoyable and we would return again next time we visit Stockholm. "
3589,608672,154737474,2017-05-26,41160368,Charlie,"Great place in the Norrmalm downtown area.  Clean, easy to find, and cozy!  I loved the little park a block away"
3590,608672,156975581,2017-06-02,53328051,Rachel,"I initially hesitated to book Karl's studio because of the strict cancellation policy, but I'm so glad I chose to stay here. First, the price/value of this place is hard to beat. Second, Karl is totally professional in everything he does: he is very responsive to communications, his place is clean, and he does a very good job orienting you to the studio and Stockholm. Specific to my stay, Karl helped me reserve time to use the building laundry room and made sure I was comfortable using the machines. He was also flexible with check-in (early) and check-out (holding my bag for the day). The bed is comfortable, I had no issues with the shower, and the location is fantastic. I would absolutely stay here again!"
3591,608672,157961007,2017-06-05,23804408,Charlotte,"Logement très bien situé, facile d'accès, propre. Seul petit bémol, la douche qui n'est pas très pratique mais pour un séjour de quelques jours, ce n'est vraiment pas un problème.
Accueil impeccable, Karl est très sympathique et parle très bien français."
3592,608672,158714571,2017-06-08,29693012,Elizabeth,"Karl was wonderful and easy to reach, making himself available in person and via phone/Airbnb at all times from booking to check out. He even met us early when our bus arrived before schedule. The apartment is small, but accurately described and in an ideal location. The apartment building has an elevator, very handy for luggage. The kitchen is small, but sufficient for breakfasts and pasta. The bathroom and kitchen share a sink. Great host, great city. "
3593,608672,159442915,2017-06-11,75424559,Ross,Great location in easy walking distance to most attractions and very close  to public transport. We enjoyed our stay here very much and Karl J was a great host with excellent communication that made the experience even more pleasurable.
3594,608672,160421865,2017-06-14,96743836,Jonathan,Excellent place in the heart of Stockholm. Karl was incredibly helpful!
3595,608672,161980068,2017-06-19,25923779,Peter,"Superb location within Stockholm, in an 18th-century house. Karl also was a very gracious host and even went to the trouble of coming down to the street to welcome me. The apartment was very clean and functional, with everything as described, but cooking something would be a minor challenge, as kitchen section and bathroom are very small. The shower is ""nordic"" indeed (good water pressure and temperature, however!), but Karl told me that he has already applied for a building permit to upgrade it, which will make it much easier to use. I had a nice time!"
3596,608672,162745022,2017-06-22,739895,Chelo,"Karl was very kind and he told me many important things about the city.  He is very affordable and speakable.

The apartment as posted is about 15-20 sqm. It is a single room, with a bath and a kitchenette.

The location is the best of it.
Apparently it use to be the maid's room from Karl's apartment. So it has it's private entrance, and it comunicates to Karl's by two doors. Both of them are permanently closed, and you also have the ability to lock them from your side.

The bathroom is the lowest point of the room. It is small, and you have to use a water fence, that Karl provides to avoid the water from the shower to wet everything inside. Also as there is only one wood door separating you from Karl's family, you can hear them talking or their tv, which can be a little awkward.

I have been there only two nights so I adapted myself to the situation."
3597,608672,164367117,2017-06-27,99602401,Shaun,"Excellent location near a metro station and 2 stops from Central Station. Exiting from the metro on Tegnergatan, if you go left and do a u-turn, there are a lot of steps to climb, tricky with luggage. If you go right and walk a block, then you can go up a hill and the apartment is at that end.

A few parks close by, a 7-11 and Lidl (pick up breakfast pastries for cheap prices), shops and restaurants are not far. Two metro stops north at St Eriksplan and across the road is Chokladfabriken for awesome hot chocolate and next door is StikkiNikki for gelato.

One stop south is Hotorget with lots of shops and see Haymarket food hall.

Two stops south is Central Station with lots of shopping and restaurants, 3 stops south takes you to Gamla Stan and 4 stops south takes you to Slussen where you can take a lift down to the bus depot and only 1 stop away is Viking Line if you're cruising. Fotografiska is also not too far away."
3598,608672,166274871,2017-07-03,22112553,Henry,"Amazing location! Very close to the main street to shops and restaurants yet also very quiet. The unit is a pleasant size for solo traveling. Overall, great value!"
3599,608672,166940959,2017-07-05,1730688,Sara,Very simple and comfortable flat in a central area of Stockholm. Karl was a nice and helpful host. Has everything you need in a historical building and safe area!
3600,608672,167596268,2017-07-07,16363718,Alex,"Karl was amazing, made sure we were well informed of what the city had to offer and made sure we knew the way around town. 10/10"
3601,608672,168839069,2017-07-10,6681200,Yannick,It is very close to the city centre. I really enjoyed my stay there. Everything was great! I would definitely recommend it to anyone. 
3602,608672,169695162,2017-07-13,68272685,Steven,"Great location very close to town. There is a station literally 3 mins walking distance. 

The place is clean and tidy.

Only thing I can give a heads up on is the host lives next door and the apartment is basically attached to his. Seems like it was once all one apartment and was renovated. There's not much space but is generally good. "
3603,608672,170626348,2017-07-16,18313450,Janko,"We stayed at Karls place for three nights and it was truly a great experience. He was there to welcome us, show us the place and introduce us to Stockholm. 
The place itself is comfortable for two people and very clean. The room is bright, but don't worry about Stockholm’s white nights, thick curtains provide a nice shade. Karl was so kind to help us with old Swedish crowns we had. He even went with us to the bank to help us out with a problem we had with Swedish Crowns. Tack! We hope to come back soon!"
3604,608672,173812630,2017-07-24,104974825,Robert,"This was a very convenient place to stay. Location is excellent.
Excellent laundry included in tariff.
The unit has a separate entrance, the bedroom/ living room is combined with a desk and 2 chairs. The shower is only just adequate as is the kitchen.
It was very clean, the host was friendly and most obliging"
3605,608672,175062267,2017-07-28,3192146,Chris J,"Karl is a friendly and welcoming host and he kindly let me check in early as I arrived on the overnight ferry from Helsinki. The check-in process was very straight-forward. The location is perfect for exploring Stockholm on foot or by Metro and there are lots of local restaurants, supermarkets, and even an English-style pub that’s well worth a visit. The room is quiet, cosy, comfortable, and ok for one person. It might be a bit too cosy for two. The walk-in-wardrobe doubles as the kitchenette which is tiny and has no sink or water. I had avoided having a shower on the ferry because the showers are so tiny, but that was a big mistake. The shower here must be the worst that I have ever come across in my travels; including several I have made comments on in reviews on here – you have to put down a small aluminium quadrant (which fails to prevent the bathroom flooding), pull round a plastic shower curtain (ditto), stand in this tiny enclave, and try to wash yourself, grabbing the soap and shampoo off the toilet lid. Afterwards, you need to scrape the bathroom floor to clean up the flood and tread on a damp floor for the next few hours. Just be aware that if you book this place, you will have a comfortable stay except in the bathroom and kitchenette."
3606,608672,176894630,2017-08-01,16543585,Magdalena,The studio is located very centrally and you can reach all the main attractions in Stockholm by foot or bike. Area is very quiet and residental. Check-In and Check-Out was very flexible and Karl is a great host. I really recommend the studio for a single or a couple who would like to stay some days/a weekend in the centre of Stockholm.
3607,608672,177791060,2017-08-04,15288553,Miriae,"Karl was kind and nice.
The location is excellent.
One thing that I really felt terrible about this appartment is the bathroom, which we had to 'sweep' the water and mop the floor after shower.
After shower, again got wet with the sweat!
Wondered why Karl didn't do something effective for the bathroom for the guests."
3608,608672,178635664,2017-08-06,10927412,Joe,Really lovely little flat in a quiet neighbourhood but so close to the main sights. Karl was a lovely and welcoming host. Flat has a wet room set-up which may be a little problematic for some (was quite tricky not to inadvertently flood the bathroom when showering!) but Karl is getting this fixed. Overall nice stay.
3609,608672,181323711,2017-08-12,28836439,Ashley,"Based off the other reviews regarding the kitchen and bathroom, we were a bit hesitant to check it out for ourselves. However, to our surprise everything was great and really, all you need for two people. The shower was a bit cramp, but it wasn't any worse than a hostel shower or small Japanese bathroom. The location of Karl's place was probably the best aspect and well worth the price paid. It was close to grocery stores, gyms, coffee shops (for Fika!) and of course Old Town. We had a wonderful stay!"
3610,608672,182988032,2017-08-16,9778316,Tayo,"Pros: 
-very centrally located within 20-30 mins walking distance of Gamla Stan and city hall. Drottninggatan, major shopping avenue is right around the corner. If you choose to use the metro, the closest station is a 5 minute walk. There's a grocery store, a corner store and lots of restaurants nearby 
- Karl was very responsive prior to and during my trip. 
- necessary amenities available and I was even able to do laundry free of charge 
- easy to navigate on public transportation from the airport 
-affordable 
-fast wifi 

Con
-the only minor con is the bathroom, but it really didn't bother me. The listing is very clear so you know what to expect up front. It isn't luxury but it gets the job done. I was hardly in my room anyway, as I was busy enjoying the wonderful city of Stockholm.

3612,608672,185899742,2017-08-23,72793591,Leiah,"Karl's place was the perfect location for a couple of nights in Stockholm. You can walk everywhere and it is very close to Central Station as well. Karl's place was clean, quiet, and well stocked with kitchen and bathroom amenities. The bed was very comfortable. We loved our short stay!"
3613,608672,186964482,2017-08-26,106876750,Maree,Great host. Even had the place ready early.
3614,608672,189178232,2017-09-01,1007377,Jin,"We lived there for four days, the host only show up when we checked in, the kitchen is small with the closet (unsafe), the bathroom is very slippery(very dangerous), because the water was not able to drain very well, so the host asked us to clean up after shower each time. We paid cleaning fee for each day, but never been cleaning with in four days. No washing machine."
3615,608672,191584309,2017-09-08,40533340,France,"Tres bien situé, à 5 minutes de la grande rue piétonnière, parle très bien français, l'appartement est propre mais ne considère pas cela comme un appartement plus une chambre avec salle de bain , très petit. La cuisine ressemble plus à un garde manger, manque flagrant d'ustensiles et la douche aurait besoin de renos, on met de l'eau partout  mais Stockholm est une très belle ville!!"
3616,608672,192205114,2017-09-10,6190076,Luca,"L'alloggio di Karl si trova in ottimo posizione, a due passi dalla metropolitana e dai negozi! 
Molto pulito e confortevole, offre tutto quello che serve per qualche giorno di relax a Stoccolma! 
Karl parla un italiano perfetto, i suoi consigli sono stati molto preziosi! 
Consigliato!"
3617,608672,193154947,2017-09-12,118364750,Mike,"Great location near to restaurants, the T-bana and the main pedestrian street.  Beautiful historic building!

Karl was an exceptional host and extremely helpful - especially when checking in."
3620,608672,196752178,2017-09-24,92613107,Anastasiia,"I'm very glad that i chose Karls' apartment for my weekend, cause it's the optimal price-quality-locarion ratio. It's great that Karl keeps in contact, answering the questions and meils very fast, also he gave exhaustive informaition how to get to the house and about apartments themselves. Clean, cozily, all things in working condition. The best choice for single or couple travellers, who are plannig to spend plenty of their time autside, walking around the city, cooming back to house to have a comfortable short rest. If I decide to visit Stockholm once more, I'll try to return here."
3621,608672,197819434,2017-09-27,44463702,효정,"This place was not big but so comfy.

3625,608672,202875616,2017-10-13,100626057,Lee,"Karl's place is very good. It is in a lovely old apartment building right in the centre of town so is extremely convenient. The main room is a good size and very clean, and the kitchenette is handy. Karl himself was very nice."
3626,608672,203411083,2017-10-15,96575662,Tara,"Karl’s place is located in an excellent location. We had a great time, communication was perfect!! I highly recommend this apartment."
3627,608672,204494162,2017-10-18,15024482,Mai,i was satisfied with my (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication was 100% on point. i arrived a little later than promised but Karl was there to greet me. the place is small but it's everything we needed. fit two comfortably. id recommend Karl's place to someone who's looking for a place to stay in stockholm.
3628,608672,204918690,2017-10-20,1830434,Simone,Karl‘s studio is a quiet clean and nice to stay and to explore stockholm! it is super central and everything can be reach via foot easily and fast! Karl is very nice and hospital and was even able to welcome me really late in the evening!
3629,608672,206383880,2017-10-25,40786269,Alessandro,"L'appartamento di Karl si trova in un edificio storico, ben attrezzato e molto vicino alla metro e, se si vuole raggiungere il centro storico (Gamla Stan) a piedi si impiegano circa quindici minuti. L'interno dell'appartamento è semplice ma curato e pulito, unica pecca il bagno piccolino con la doccia scomoda (il proprietario ci ha informati che a breve farà dei lavori per sistemare il problema). Karl è stato gentile e disponibile, ci ha accolti personalmente nonostante fossero le due di mattina, e ci ha inoltre spiegato come visitare Stoccolma. Consigliato per il rapporto qualità-prezzo, considerando i costi elevati della città."
3630,608672,209049849,2017-11-04,43524908,Denise,"Die Unterkunft von Karl befindet sich in einer ruhigen Strasse, aber die Einkaufsstrasse befindet sich gleich parallel. Es ist also ein super
Standort und man kann alles zu fuss erreichen. Karl war sehr freundlich und obwohl wir sehr spät ankamen hat das check-in super geklappt. Wir empfehlen die Unterkunft aufjedenfall weiter und würden bei einem nächsten Besuch in Stockholm
wieder zu Karl
gehen."
3631,608672,209871159,2017-11-06,142579413,Spinu,"Very clean and central,Karl J was a very nice host,he helped us with pills for headache and everything we needed."
3632,608672,210807112,2017-11-11,33672517,Kef,"It's an independent studio but you will see that it's originally a room of a bigger apartment.  In the studio, there are two doors that connect to the original apartment where Karl lives.  You will hear him and his wife talking through the doors.  However, it has not been any problem for me as I'm just in and out to take a shower and sleep.  The location is absolutely superb and this is quite central and close to many restaurants and bars.  Also, just 5min walk to a subway station, from which you can get to most places in Stockholm under 15-20 minutes.  I'd definitely stay at this place again."
3633,608672,212128457,2017-11-16,11273283,Fenella,"Charming studio, clean and ideally situated. However it's about time that the a proper shower be installed. Karl was reactive and helpful."

Karl was also very detailed in providing directions and prompt in responding to our messages. The apartment was cosy and had all the amenities that we needed. Definitely enjoyed our stay in Stockholm!"

Comme annoncé, la douche n'est pas très pratique, mais c'est acceptable."

3640,608672,221641416,2017-12-27,7412812,Pandu,"Karl’s place was just strategically located in the heart of the city. Very nearby to the subway metro what connects most of the parts of the city. Its small, but surprisingly it accommodates 2 persons adequately. Plus with the small kitchen which was very useful to use to quickly prepare some basic meals. As written from other comments, bathroom is basic, with relatively small shower area. But it was okay for me, as i am not so tall.

Karl was also very communicative, giving us some basic info of the city and even giving us reco on some restos open during xmas time.

Highly recommend for anyone who wants yo stay in Stockholm."
3641,608672,224029777,2018-01-02,140381887,Kathrin,"Kleines aber feines Apartment mit einem sehr bequemen Bett.
Die Lage ist wirklich super - Ubahn um die Ecke und die Altstadt ist zu Fuß gut erreichbar. 
Karl war ein super freundlicher Gastgeber und die Kommunikation verlief ohne Probleme. Sehr empfehlenswert!"

It was my first time in Sweden and I was traveling solo, so Karl’s tips and quick responses to my questions were so helpful. He really cares about the experience of his guests!"

3649,608672,246813420,2018-03-26,112790607,Kei,"It was a very classical and interesting room. The room is in the center of the city and it is convenient to go anywhere. The owner, Mr. Karl is very kind, the previous guests checked out earlier, so he told me that I can go the room earlier than planned."
3650,608672,247610289,2018-03-29,57789691,Gabby,Karl was a great host. He was very kind and quick to respond to any questions we had. His Airbnb was perfect and would recommend to anyone!
3651,608672,250221479,2018-04-04,61571303,Kirsten,"Karl’s place was in the perfect location! We were able to explore the city all on foot and had no problems getting anywhere! Karl was kind, he met us for check in and gave us some tips of things to see and do. The shower is so small, and it’s kind of hard to keep the water where it should be; but it was a warm shower and functional!"
3652,608672,253805224,2018-04-15,103035093,Audrey,Karl a été très accueillant à notre arrivée. Même la communication en amont était parfaite. Pour un séjour de quelques jours ce logement est confortable.

нет нормального  душа  , кухни и шкафа ,  и маленький размер комнаты  - это огорчило .  Место очень тихое ."

He is a kind and gracious host and his detailed and quick communication helped me find the place without any problems. The flat is in a fantastic location and I appreciated being able to access so much of the city so easily. Would gladly return.
3659,608672,264893541,2018-05-15,42216597,Florian,"Das Studio ist genau wie beschrieben und liegt sehr zentral, nur 10 Minuten vom Hauptbahnhof entfernt. Karl antwortet sehr schnell und hilft wenn er benötigt wird!"
3660,608672,268556488,2018-05-25,157661974,Tito Mario Franco,"Eccezionale accoglienza oltre ogni aspettativa, anche nel proporre escursioni che a noi, non del luogo, sarebbero rimaste totalmente sconosciute.  Parlando perfettamente l'italiano (essendo vissuto diversi anni in Italia), il Sig K. è stato un ottimo filtro fra noi e Stoccolma. I problemi relativi al bagno, di cui eravamo perfettamente a conoscenza  da altre recensioni , sono stati facilmente superati con un certo spirito di adattamento. Il Sig. K. ci ha spiegato del resto che nel palazzo in cui è presente l'appartamento, essendo storico,   non è possibile ottenere facilmente permessi di  modifica o ristrutturazione dallo stato iniziale. In ogni caso giudizio nettamente positivo che ha reso il nostro soggiorno a Stoccolma, città meravigliosa,  ancora più gradevole."
3661,608672,272309759,2018-06-03,74181152,Matthieu,"Petit studio indépendant à celui de Karl, très bien agencé. Très bon accueil de Karl en français! Le logement est très bien placé en centre  ville et proche des transports et magasins. 

La seule à redire c'est la fameuse douche... En attente de travaux mais reste fonctionnelle! "
3662,608672,275994438,2018-06-12,70460532,Quirin,Nett und höflich. Tolle Lage. Zuvorkommend trotz späten checkin. Rustikales aber funktionstüchtiges Badezimmer.
3663,608672,278930004,2018-06-19,147435073,Minh Tan,Very good location - near Metro station and fun streets but very quiet.
3664,608672,280889354,2018-06-24,8559322,Manuela,"The appartement is in a perfect location for enjoying the classic tourist program in Stockholm. We managed to see nearly all in a walking distance. 
It‘s very quiet although, because it‘s just around the corner of the main streets and the window‘s go to the backyard.
The appartement it self is not big, but just perfect for a city trip. 
There‘s everything you could need for your stay in Stockholm (even a small kitchen area).
Karl is a great host, wrote back quick and had at the beginning great tipps for our stay in this amazing city.
Really can recommend this appartement if you wanna be close to the main part of Stockholm."
3665,608672,283709356,2018-06-30,26232863,Panupan,A really good host.
3666,608672,290353888,2018-07-14,149628088,Taryn,"Karl is a very friendly and helpful host. 
I had already been travelling for 2 weeks and he was happy to arrange use of the laundry facilities during my check in.
He explained how to use everything clearly and even gifted me some laundry detergent to use.
I was worried about the bathroom facilities after reading some reviews but they were fine. 
The apartment was lovely and was everything I wanted for my 2 week stay.
The apartment is so close to everything, I know other reviews have said that but SERIOUSLY! 
Drottinggatan is one block over and everything is in walking distance, and I am not a fit person.
If I ever have the chance to return to Stockholm I would stay in Karls place again.

3667,608672,294025033,2018-07-21,97476232,Susanne,"Klein und sehr gemütlich. Netter Vermieter, der auch deutsch spricht. Schön zentral. Konnte alles zu Fuß erreichen. Küche ist ein kleiner Raum mit Fenster, Kühlschrank, Mikrowelle, 2 Herdplatten (mobil), Kaffeemaschine, Geschirr, Töpfe, Besteck. Kein Wasseranschluss. Das Geschirr muss mit einer kleinen Wanne im Bad abgespült werden. Ist aber kein Problem. Funktioniert gut. WLAN funktioniert tadellos. Das Apartment ist sehr hellhörig, da es von der Wohnung des Vermieters nur mittels abgesperrten Zimmertüren abgetrennt wurde. Da dieser aber keinen Lärm macht, ist das kein Problem. Ich hoffe, ich war auch nicht zu laut :-). Hat mir gut gefallen. Ich kann die Unterkunft empfehlen."

3670,608672,302772417,2018-08-06,8016073,Harri,Friendly host and a good location. The room was separated from  owners apartment and has own entrance. Sounds from main apartment could still be easily heard. The bathroom needs an urgent renovation. 
3671,608672,305461546,2018-08-11,184238056,Sandro,"The apartment is perfectly located close to the city center and right around the corner of Drottninggatan (pedestrian zone with bars, restaurants and shops). Almost everything is in walking distance. The apartment matches Karl‘s description and he is a very friendly host who gave us great tips for our visit!"

3673,608672,312217054,2018-08-23,56063699,Paul,"This tiny but lovely, clean the studio was in a fantastic location – walkable to everywhere we wanted to go in the city. The kitchen and shower are quite makeshift so don’t plan to eat meals other than a simple breakfast in the apartment. The host was responsive but unobtrusive – we never saw him after our initial hello."
3674,608672,313833443,2018-08-26,14845270,Aneta,"una bella esperienza,la casa quasi centrale,Karl che parla quasi perfettamente italiano, nonostante la cucina piccola ed il bagno da ristrutturare abbiamo passato bene quei 3 giorni a Stoccolma. 
da ripetere assolutamente. "

3677,608672,318985573,2018-09-05,52662538,Emma,Karl was so wonderful! Extremely communicative and helpful. He met us at the flat and gave us a recommendation to eat at a local steakhouse. He also let us borrow a travel card which saved us a bit of money. We had a wonderful stay! Would highly recommend!
3678,608672,331614065,2018-10-03,44632981,Franziska,We had a great time at Karls apartment. The location is great and the place was a comfortable place to stay! Would go again!
3679,608672,332372233,2018-10-05,125205849,Caroline,A  clean and quiet room at 10min walk from the central station. The welcome was warm and friendly.

3681,608672,334831580,2018-10-10,178710313,Rachel,Karl’s place was perfect for our stay in Stockholm! Close enough to walk to everything but far enough away from any loud noise. It was clean and cozy and in a beautiful building! I definitely recommend it!

3688,608672,344854791,2018-11-04,2651229,Luca,"Very clean and nice furnitured room. The location is great and very central.

3689,608672,346364496,2018-11-08,59295645,Jan,"Small apartment adjacent to the Karl’s own living quarters with private access from the stairwell in beautiful stylish apartment building. Place has internal doors but these are obviously locked, very clever set up. It had everything needed for the discerning business traveler including a desk and iron board. Very quiet location close to metro/tube station.
Cooking facilities limited (microwave only)  but very central so plenty eat-out options and large supermarket at walking distance. Highly recommended."

3693,608672,350776694,2018-11-20,49591996,Yi,The landlords were so kind that they waited for me as late as 0.30 to check in. The small flat was very cosy and well-located in a historical building in central Stockholm. The only minus is the shower. Installation of proper shower facilities will add much more value to the accommodation.
3694,608672,352499860,2018-11-25,194639719,Josephin,Great location!
3695,608672,357403836,2018-12-10,56596013,Karen Ósk,"Stayed in Karl's apartment for 2 nights in December and it was lovely. Well furnished, clean and just enough for 1-2 people. The location could not be better, very close to downtown Stockholm but you don't hear any noise from the downtown area which is a huge plus. Me and my friend liked the stay here and would book it again :) Karl and Karin were extremely nice! and good to have them just next door if there's anything."
3696,608672,358139934,2018-12-13,94370146,Anita,"So many good things about the stay at Karl’s place! Quiet street, beautiful building, comfortable space (for one at least), Karl was responsive to email. Shower situation is a little awkward. Otherwise really enjoyed my visit."
3697,608672,359073539,2018-12-16,203073124,Kieran,"Hosts were lovely and had very fast replies. Room exactly as advertised (although pictures don't capture the best angles), everything needed was there and couldn't find any area which was particularly dirty. Very good value for money considering the location and how easy it is to get to T-Central. Definitely would recommend to anyone planning a city break to Stockholm."
3698,608672,366801322,2019-01-03,211640439,Marie-Noel,"Une chambre idéalement située pour visiter Stockholm. Le métro, la gare et les commerces sont à proximité. Les lieux d’intérêts à 15/20min à pied. Les seuls problèmes sont la douche !!! Du jamais vu en 30 ans de voyage dans le monde et la cuisine qui n’en est pas une. Il y a juste un micro-onde, un frigo et un peu de vaisselle. C’est dommage car l’immeuble est très calme et vraiment bien situé !!"
3699,608672,401863211,2019-01-16,222659880,Andy,"Accurate pictures, great location. Good host and check in. Slept well. Will definitely stay here again."
3700,608672,403030027,2019-01-20,225838518,Tarek,"Karl's room is just excellent for a quick trip to the city. I reckon it must be hard to find a better location (10 min walk from Tcentralen, 15-20 min walk from gamla Stan, with underground and buses connecting you to any point of the city). The area is full of supermarkets and convenience shops, cafes, pubs and restaurants so you will be sorted out for the whole trip. The place is small and set up like a hotel room, but elegantly decorated and the finishes are very nice. The room was very warm and comfortable, and the bed is a delight. There's no cooking facilities but you have a microwave, coffee maker and a small fridge. Also the host let some coffee, tea, water and snacks ready for me, very thoughtful. Also they didn't care and waited for me since I arrived beyond midnight to do my check in Only con of this flat would be the shower: is very messy and it takes you a while after to clean the bathroom, but I guess that's just the only way to make it fit, and once again is nothing major. Karl's place is just excellent if it's your first time in Stockholm and you're looking for making your trip easy going. Definitely would repeat."
3701,608672,403984663,2019-01-22,132747591,Rhia,I had a really wonderful stay at Karl’s place! I was given assistance whenever I needed it at the apartment was in a very central location. Very clean and neat space with everything I needed. Having a lift was helpful as I had a lot of luggage! I’d definitely stay here again.
3702,608672,404478154,2019-01-24,222659880,Andy,Stayed here a couple of times now and it's been great both times.
3703,608672,407144154,2019-02-01,149303773,Sasha,Karl was a lovely host. Check in and check out was super easy. The apartment was lovely and cozy. The location was absolutely perfect with supermarkets very close by and is within walking distance of everything I wanted to do. Perfect place to stay and experience Stockholm.
3704,608672,407966349,2019-02-03,81323927,Cory,"Karl’s listing was perfect and as described. The location is fantastic, close to metro and local restaurants, and was perfectly suited for a solo traveler exploring the city for a weekend. I would absolutely book again on a subsequent trip"
3705,608672,409636003,2019-02-08,226207843,Scott,"Although a small space, it's perfect for 1-2 people. The location is excellent!  Only a 2 block walk to one of the main shopping and restaurant areas in the city. A 3 block walk from metro station as well. Very convenient.  Located in a quiet, beautiful building."
3706,608672,410578039,2019-02-10,92863750,Moira,A super location from which to explore Stockholm.
3707,608672,412344487,2019-02-15,35335563,Alejandra,"Karl es un anfitrión muy amable. El edificio en donde está el estudio tiene una ubicación excelente en un barrio muy lindo!
Todo está muy limpio. Para mí el único detalle sería especificar muy bien que en el mismo espacio que hay para moverse en el baño es en donde te bañas. Eso quizá hubiera hecho que yo cambiara mi elección de lugar pero puede no ser tan relevante para las demás personas. 
Por lo demás, el lugar es excelente!"
3708,608672,413791821,2019-02-18,110617117,Phanie,Karl’s place was everything we need it ( two people and a baby). Is small but near public transportation to move around Stockholm without issues. If you don’t mind small places then this is for you! Very quiet and safe area.
3709,608672,414952297,2019-02-21,161428946,Marie-Louise,"Trevligt och mycket centralt boende, gångväg till det mesta och bra busslinjer. Trevlig värd."
3710,608672,416873396,2019-02-25,8921300,Jerry,"Cozy, warm space in Stockholm! The studio was perfect for a solo traveler like myself, and provided easy access (both by transport and foot) to the attractions in Stockholm. For future guests: the soundproofing isn't great between the studio and the apartment of the hosts, so you'll hear some noises during the stay but nothing too loud."
3711,608672,418421928,2019-03-02,34252012,Skander,"L’appartement est très bien situé, la douche n’est pas très pratique mais cela s’oublie vite. J’y retournerai avec plaisir."
3712,608672,421361023,2019-03-09,50169713,Johanne,"Propre, petit, très bien situé, parfait pour une personne seule ou un couple."
3713,608672,423873144,2019-03-15,219740899,David,Great location with good access to public transit and plenty of restrictions nearby.  It is a cozy space in a nice building.
3714,608672,424853988,2019-03-17,66524496,Zachary,A lovely little space in an ideal location. Couldn’t be better!
3715,608672,426539685,2019-03-21,14896346,Chloe,"Super location and really nice little room. All the necessary amenities - little kitchenette with fridge & microwave, bathroom and cozy bedroom.  Would highly recommend!"
3716,608672,430335763,2019-03-30,17505783,Megan,Karl’s place was clean and well appointed. The location is great with lots of food and things to do nearby. I felt right at home in this neighborhood; it was busy and fun without feeling touristy.
3717,608672,431583778,2019-04-01,37795590,Scott,"Good location, easily accessible from public transit. Either walking from the central station or taking transit to the closest station was a breeze."
3718,608672,433366397,2019-04-06,165230241,Jelena,"My stay at the studio was great, it is not very spacious, but it is big enough to feel comfortable, very clean and perfectly located, right in the center of Stockholm, in a beautiful building. Great value for money!"
3719,608672,434714652,2019-04-08,38946430,Fred,"I stayed at the apartment for a couple of nights, and found it a perfect base to explore Stockholm. It was very close to the station, and within walking distance of all the major sites in the city. The space itself was very clean, and well-suited to travellers staying in Stockholm on city breaks, with a small pantry/kitchen I used to make lunch to take out with me around the city. Check in was very easy, and Karin and Karl were very responsive to messages throughout the trip. Would definitely recommend staying here to friends!"
3720,608672,438231351,2019-04-16,88903217,John,What a great location for exploring Stockholm.  Hosts are attentive but not intrusive - the space is comfortable and tidy.  Metro is nearby but you can walk to the Royal Palace in about 20.   Remarkably quiet given that you're in the middle of the City and there are good restaurants and shops nearby.
3721,608672,443507450,2019-04-26,28524052,Judi,"Cozy, well appointed space for a short stay in Stockholm. Everything is convenient in the flat and compact, a good value when looking for a place downtown."
3722,608672,451186172,2019-05-11,231010961,Bradley,Centrally located in a nice neighborhood. Loads of things to do within a 5 minute walk.
3723,608672,452850567,2019-05-14,41039658,Pippa,The location was amazing. It was clean and warm. All that I needed.
3724,608672,453524840,2019-05-16,6822615,Frida,"Nice appartment in a very cosy area, walking distance to the Central station and top shopping areas."
3725,608672,461262205,2019-05-31,181080824,Hans Kristian,"Flott 1-roms husvære. Eigen inngang. Sentralt i byen. God seng. Roleg område. Litt lite bad/wc, mykje vatn ut på golvet (ikkje fall mot sluk). Kjem gjerne attende."
3726,608672,462727174,2019-06-02,86478028,Guillermo,"The apartment had every thing to cover our necessities. It is perfect for a couple, very cozy, located in a very centric zone, with an outstanding comfortable bed, and with all the necessary utilities. Karl's son was very nice to us and very attentive."
3727,608672,464708923,2019-06-06,200352040,Kensley,This flat was perfect for 2 people and easily access to the subway!
3728,608672,468675404,2019-06-13,184313292,Dino,"Great, clean flat in a central location. It had everything I needed and it was very quiet. The bathroom floor does get pretty wet when you shower but i didn’t mind. Highly recommended!"
3729,608672,470477945,2019-06-16,32107280,Anne,"Chouette séjour dans un quartier calme mais proche de tout . Studio ideal pour une personne. Super literie. Juste une remarque par rapport à la douche, assez rudimentaire. Appréciables les petites attentions, à dispo de quoi prendre du café, du thé. Micro onde à dispo aussi. A recommander "
3730,608672,473295080,2019-06-21,23486935,Deborah,Exactly how the apt is described.  We really enjoyed the neighborhood.  Our favorite breakfast spot was Gost — go check it out!
3731,608672,475384739,2019-06-24,19169255,Mariana,"Localização excelente a passos das principais atrações e mercados. Muito limpo e organizado apesar de ser bem pequeno, como está escrito. Mas como o propósito é passear fica sendo ótimo. 
Não tem uma estrutura para se cozinhar, apenas para preparar lanches. Tem uma geladeira e um microondas.  Porém no mercado encontramos boas variedades de pratos fáceis de preparar. Anfitriões atenciosos e com rápida respostas. Me senti muito bem."
3732,608672,477913179,2019-06-29,54117795,Christian,"I truly enjoyed my stay at Karl's studio flat. It's clean, quiet, cozy and located in an amazing place on Norrmalm. It is in a parallel street to Drottninggatan, the long street which runs through the center of Stockholm down to Old town. Considering how expensive Stockholm can be, the studio apartment provides great value for money. It most suitable for one or two people (either for business or leisure) who are in Stockholm for a shorter stay. It is not suitable for travelers who wish to cook their own food as their is no stove (there is however a microwave and a filter coffee maker). I would recommend it and be very happy to stay again."
3733,608672,480281045,2019-07-02,107547422,Alexander,"Ich würde es eher so beschreiben, ein schönes Zimmer in sehr guter Zentraler Lage zum Innenhof, ein Abstellraum in dem es eine Möglichkeit gibt , sich in der Mikrowelle was warm zu machen oder einen Kaffee zuzubereiten. Mehr geht hier wirklich nicht.  Ein kleines Badezimmer mit einer Duscharmatur und einem Abfluss  im Boden und Duschvorhang. Nach dem Duschen steht das komplette Badezimmer unter Wasser , der Boden muss mit Gummiwischern zum Abfluss hin abezogen werden und mit einem Bodentuch getrocknet. werden. Sehr aufwendig, da man hier nicht von einer wirklichen Dusche sprechen kann.  So weit war alles gut , wem die Ausstattung zu einem relativ  normalen Preis genügt nicht viel Ansprüche stellt ist hier richtig. Wer gerne richtig duscht ist hier allerdings falsch."
3734,608672,481094398,2019-07-04,1145793,Fabian,Cosy and quiet place right in the center of Norrmalm. Very flexible checking/checkout allowed me to get the maximum out of a short stay. Would return without hesitating.
3735,608672,483087685,2019-07-07,75131697,David And Paula,"Nice small flat. Excellent location within walking distance to grocery store, shopping, and restaurants. Our favorite place was Queens Head. It is a very short walk. Great pub with excellent food. We enjoyed our stay very much."
3736,608672,485078160,2019-07-10,111672506,Hayley,Great hospitality and communication
3737,608672,487647874,2019-07-14,47989499,Manuela,Great location! Karin was helpful and always available
3738,608672,493778720,2019-07-23,15375555,Robby,"Nice little spot with great hosts. Good area of town—close to restaurants, bars, and stores. I would stay here again. :)"
3739,608672,495710869,2019-07-26,36012156,Caitlin,"This is a cute cozy place to stay while hopping through Stockholm. So close to everything and easy to get to. Karin is a kind and wonderful host with great communication, thank you infinitely for the warm stay."
3740,608672,498681323,2019-07-30,164734243,Amber,Karin and Gabriel were extremely helpful and went above and beyond to help me feel safe and thoroughly informed about the Stockholm area. I only stayed one night but they treated me as if I was going to be a long time guest. They had printed out maps and suggestions for the city that they gave me so I could use and write on. They were incredible hosts
3741,608672,500572160,2019-08-02,163383935,Jami,"Excellent location. Comfortable room. Karin and her son, Gabriel were excellent hosts. They gave me some great tips, including restaurants and places to visit. If you plan to be in the flat during the day or evening, you should be aware that voices and movements (cooking, cleaning, etc.) in the rest of the flat are loud and clear from your room. This didn’t bother me at all, and I was pleased with my stay. I can’t say enough about the location-a couple of blocks from the metro and an easy walk to restaurants, cafes, bars, shopping. I walked to old town several times as well. Great place; I highly recommend!!"
3742,608672,504227556,2019-08-07,68922638,Lauren,"The title of Karin’s flat is accurate.  It was cozy, close to any and all that I wanted to do and see.  I was sad to leave.  I stayed 5 nights.  It’s amenities were wonderful, including the laundry room.  The room had a wonderful closet with a little place for coffee, refrigerator, and counter.  Then the room was spacious with a bright window.  I would recommend this location to anyone who likes to spend all day in the city with the crowds but wants peace and quiet when it is time to relax."
3743,608672,505977073,2019-08-10,13731376,Ann-Katrin,The apartment is well located and in a very pretty building. You have everything you need and the bed is very comfortable! Even though you’re close to the centre it’s very  quiet and peaceful! Karin was a wonderful host and we can definitely recommend staying here!
3744,608672,506948905,2019-08-11,178637917,Christine,"Great location, clean space and a helpful and responsive host."
3745,608672,513198285,2019-08-19,17398014,Laura,"The apartment was very nice, small but more than enough to explore the city and sleep very comfortably. The location is absolutely wonderful, it really could not be better. I walked everywhere and it is also near a lot of public transport. Karin left me great tips for local bars and restaurants and she is a very good host. Checking in and out could not have been easier. The building is also very beautiful and feels historic. If I return, I hope to stay there again. It was lovely!"
3746,608672,513805409,2019-08-20,48309904,Léa,Karin was very helpful and nice. The room is nice for one night but the bathroom without proper shower space is not really convenient.
3747,608672,515595675,2019-08-23,93862262,Maeve,"Hosts were very responsive as well as accommodating with our check in/check-out times. They also prepared a map/mini guide book
 of things to do/places to eat in the area which we enjoyed."
3748,608672,518050264,2019-08-26,136018111,Александра,"Nice and l clean apartment, but really small and without kitchen. There is small fridge and microwave in pantry. Apartment doesn’t have shower cabin, you need to use shower curtain standing on the floor."
3749,608672,521596804,2019-09-01,1952027,Karen,"This studio is an amazing location in Stockholm, very central and in walking distance to everything. The kitchenette has a fridge and microwave and you can buy groceries and wine from around the corner. Karin and Gabriel are amazing hosts, Karin waited up for me as my train was delayed by 7 hours and Gabriel checked in with me to make sure I could make my plane. They are both very lovely and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay."
3750,608672,523270401,2019-09-03,190837294,Emily,I highly recommend a stay in this airbnb! The hosts are so wonderful and provide some great amenities for their guests!
3751,608672,524701892,2019-09-06,234832281,Suzanne,"Wonderful hosts. A great, convenient location for walking in Stockholm to Gamla Stan etc. We felt like locals living in a typical old apartment building."
3752,608672,527110157,2019-09-10,99159126,Frank,Ideal location. Easy walk to sites and restaurants and shops. Apartment very well equipped...even had bandaids for my foot blisters. Warm and cozy and in a safe upscale area. Ideal place for single traveller.
3753,608672,528425498,2019-09-13,3139907,Lil,"Karin’s studio apartment is a pretty, very comfortable and conveniently located place to stay in the center of Stockholm. I haven’t used the kitchenette. The shower worked just fine. Loved this place as a base for a few days in the city and highly recommend."
3754,608672,530720059,2019-09-16,50138883,Chiara,"Very lovely host. Perfect communication. Confortable room and bed. Only point to improve: shower (but we knew in advance from pictures). Perfect spaces organization and kitchenette facilities. Excellent position (2min walk from Coop, apoteke, metro and coffees + 3 metro stops from Gamla Stan)."
3755,608672,533167582,2019-09-21,144594392,Brenda,"Karin was super friendly and made us felt welcomed to her place. We had everything we needed and the location of the place was superb. 

However it could get a little noisy as we could hear the lift doors open and close, and also sounds of the lift going up and down as the bed was just right at the main door."
3756,608672,534760569,2019-09-23,69470066,Mary Kate,"Very comfortable, clean and quiet room. Nice location. Karin was very helpful and gave great recommendations for things to do in the city. Would stay there again. Highly recommend"
3757,610034,1959948,2012-08-12,2670568,Fabian,"wow what an amazing apt! I strongly recommend it!! You find everything in this lovely apt what you need for a perfect stay in Stockholm. The situation is perfect to discover the city. food store and several bars and restaurant are in walking distance. Ida and her boyfriend help you when you need something...great hosts.
So when you have the chance to stay there....just go for it!!"
3758,610034,4495786,2013-05-08,2902435,Rodolphe,Ida was very kind and very easy to reach for any questions of organisation. Her appartment is well located in the great area of Sodermalm.
3759,610034,5190646,2013-06-17,5404117,Daniel,"Overall, a great experience!

1. CLEAN AND COMFORTABLE - Comfortable, clean and actually a very nicely decorated apartment with fun details and thoughtful design! I nearly fell in love with the couch, which is even more comfortable than the one I have at home.  The bathroom looks newly renovated, with a fantastic rainforest shower head that made my day (and yes, with perfect water pressure)! The loft bed is a twin-sized bed and comfortable, but could be a bit snug for taller individuals.

2. LOCATION - Only a short 8-9 minute walk to the Stanskull train station, from which you can get to almost anywhere easily and quickly.  There's also a city bike rack nearby (on the way to train station as well), so that is an option for getting around the city as well.  There's a great little bakery on the way to the train station and a great place to get breakfast (Wallins), or else a grocery store right around the corner for anything you might need.

3. GREAT HOSTESS - Ida (pronounced, ""Ee-da"") was fantastic with providing information on helping us get to the city, and able to accommodate our arrival and departure times.  Very friendly and gracious, thank you, Ida!"
3760,610034,5532264,2013-07-04,3685757,Brian,"Ida was great.  She met us (even though we were running a bit late) and then showed us the apartment.  She clearly explained everything (locks, garbage, etc.) and was easy to contact during our stay when we had questions.  I would rent from her again."
3761,610034,5852200,2013-07-19,7296608,Stephanie," It was great to meet Ida. She was very helpful and friendly, had some useful tipps for us to discover the city and we had a very uncomplicated contact with her. Ida really offers a beautiful apt for 2 persons - if you're a couple!
"
3762,610034,6111541,2013-07-30,3846301,Jiannis,"Beautiful apartment in great location. Didn't get the opportunity to chat with Ida, but she had everything prepared with extra care and love.
The sofa is very comfortable too, so no need to share the top bed, which might be too narrow if you're not a couple."
3763,610034,6208729,2013-08-03,7820567,Elizabeth,"Wonderful! The place was comfortable (and stylish!), clean, and conveniently located. Best of all, Ida was very easy to coordinate with - thank you!"
3764,610034,6657304,2013-08-20,6935709,Nicolas,"Beautiful flat, The pictures doesn't' lie  . We found everything in perfect conditions.
The location is great if you want to be in Sodermalm  (that was my case)

The only thing to improve : the mattress is not broad enought  a couple ... not impossible , but surely not comfortable. 

Nico"
3765,610948,2074552,2012-08-23,3085394,Kerri,"Lina's apartment not only has great style, but is in a great location with beautiful views of the old town (only a short walk away). It was easy communicating with Lina throughout the whole process, and we really appreciated the list she left for us of her favorite places in the area. It was great to experience shopping, restaurants and coffee shops recommended by a local. If we ever head back to Stockholm, we would definitely stay here again."
3766,610948,2206792,2012-09-05,3008099,Mar,"We spend 7 days at Lina and Marcus' apartment and it was fantastic! The apartment is very nice, peaceful, clean and with a lot of light in every room! We liked very much the decoration, it was very modern and comfortable. We felt like home!

It was near the metro but we really didn't used even once because you could go walking almost everywhere (15min to the old town, Gamla Stan). The neighborhood was very nice also, with everything that we need very near (bar, restaurant, supermarket) and also it was kind of the old town architecture and very beautiful to walk (there was an amazing view point to Gamla Stan only 2min of the apartment)

They are very nice, very easy to contact and helpful with every needs that we had. They leave us an amazing map with recommendations like bars, shops and restaurants that was very helpful!

If we ever come back to Stockholm we would definitely stay in his apartment again! 

Totally recommended!"
3767,610948,2823647,2012-11-07,2554510,Charles,"Lina's apartment is fantastic - it was a real pleasure to stay here!  The pictures barely do it justice - it's quite roomy (except for the compact Scandinavian bathroom) and comfy, very well decorated, light, and clean.  It's also a fantastic location - Södermalm is a great vacation base with food, shopping, and neighborhood charm all around, plus the flat is about 3 small blocks to a metro stop so it's quick to get anywhere else in the city.  The only bad thing about my stay here is that it didn't last longer!

Lina is also a great host.  She left us a super handy map of the immediate area with her restaurant and shopping recommendations.  She made sure we were taken care of and quickly answered any questions we had, even though she was on vacation herself.  She went above and beyond in numerous other tiny ways, too.  Basically, she's the perfect airbnb host!

All in all, I really can't recommend this apartment highly enough."
3768,610948,3127515,2012-12-21,2278952,Lauren,"This was my first time using Airbnb and i was extremely happy with my stay at Lina and Marcus's apartment. Lina & Marcus are thoughtful friendly hosts with timely, excellent and efficient communication. They were very accommodating to our needs and provided us with detailed information about their apartment and the location. My family and I stayed at the apartment for four weeks and found it to be very comfortable, cosy and in a prime location. The apartment was extremely clean, neat and tidy. If ever I needed something they were a easily contactable. We would love to stay there again in the future. Thanks again"
3769,610948,3187807,2012-12-30,419497,Joshua,"Lina's home is absolutely beautiful. The living area is large and warm and the bedroom is small and very cozy. It's in a fantastic location. Lina was kind enough to provide us with a list of places to check out, all shown on a map. Lina was very accommodating. Very highly recommended."
3770,610948,3797222,2013-03-16,5032313,Trine,"Had some work to do in Stockholm, Söder. The apartment was perfect for this, bright and perfect location. Very accommodating hosts. Recommended!"
3771,610948,4197873,2013-04-17,115631,Blake,"The best Airbnb experiences match hosts and guests that seem like they already know each other—or should. I felt right at home in Lina and Marcus's wonderful flat. They are very involved in their city, are well traveled and connected. If you get a chance to stay with them, take the chance to appreciate their wonderful aesthetic and fun conversation. Thanks for hosting me, Lina and Marcus!"
3772,610948,4856126,2013-05-29,1682804,Clarisse,"Lina is a great host. She always answered our questions very fast and gave us useful advice. Her apartment is very pleasant, clean and luminous. It also has a good location, near the shops (supermarkets, biological store) and the subway, in a very nice area, near Sofo and the old town. We recommend it!"
3773,610948,6417619,2013-08-12,6091252,Katya,"Lina and her partner were really helpful and the flat is amazing. We loved the area so much, we'd think about living there permanently if we had the choice. The flat is well situated, so convenient for shops, going out to eat and getting the metro.  I loved the fact we could run or walk to the beach on hot days! Lina was very accommodating and the flat really feels like home away from home."
3774,610948,6609189,2013-08-19,1916182,Alexis,"This is a dream apartment in Stockholm! It is spacious and comfortable, and the decor is very stylish yet relaxed at the same time. We also loved the location. Sodermalm itself is a great neighborhood, and it's a pleasant walk from the apartment to Gamla Stan, the old town--or you can easily hop on the metro if you prefer. Lina was very kind and thoughtful; she made sure we had everything we might need for our stay. We had an amazing time in Stockholm, and wish we could have stayed longer in both that magical city and this wonderful apartment. "
3775,610948,11764822,2014-04-14,758316,Michael,Lina's flat was both beautiful and perfectly located. The flat was maybe a 5 minute walk from the nearest T-Bana station and offered great views of the city center (only 3 stops away). Communication was a snap and I will definitely consider staying here during my next Stockholm trip.
3776,610948,12901184,2014-05-13,13104159,Caroline,"An absolutely fantastic place to stay in Stockholm! The flat is literally in the heart of the city. Out of the kitchen window - enjoy the picturesque view of the town during the breakfast and in the evening the fabulous sun-set before you head out for drinks in bars or restaurants or the old town. The old town is within 10-15 minutes walk. If you are too tired to walk then jump onto the sub which is abt 2 minutes away from the flat. All convinience stores are within very short walking distance. Same is true for boutiques, shops and cafés. 

Lina is a perfect host: she is prompt in responding to any queries and has prepared a booklet with very nice recommendations. Would I go to Lina's place again? Oh yes!

"
3777,610948,14269043,2014-06-16,13361968,Leah,"Lina's apartment was perfect for exploring Stockholm--it was extremely conveniently located, in an interesting and active neighborhood. The apartment itself is lovely; full of light & art and absolutely fantastic to come home to. Lina was a great host, key pickup was easy & she left us some great suggestions for neighborhood shops & restaurants. (Amazing bakery recommended by Lina is only 3 short blocks away!)"
3778,610948,15859006,2014-07-17,12612336,Susanne,"Wir können diese Wohnung sehr empfehlen. Lina ist eine freundliche,  unkomplizierte Gastgeberin, wir hatten viele gute Tipps von ihr. Die Wohnung ist hell, sauber und super gelegen. Was will man mehr? "
3779,610948,16717158,2014-08-01,1498233,Chris,"I had a wonderful 2 week-long stay at Lina and Marcus' lovely flat.  Lina was great with her detailed and prompt communications, and even had some chocolate and wine for me when I arrived.  The flat itself is ideally located with easy access to both buses and T-bana (not to mention an amazing view from the kitchen window), and I loved spending time in their beautiful space as well as the neighborhood.  Lina and Marcus were kind enough to meet up with me during my stay and it was a real pleasure getting to know them.  It was the best kind of airbnb experience I could have hoped for and I look forward to returning to Stockholm!   "
3780,610948,18710833,2014-08-31,9143234,Markus,"Me and my girlfriend stayed in this apartment for a whole month in August and it was perfect. Very beautiful, clean and stylish! The location was also great, just a 3 mins walk to the subway, furthermore, a few steps away from the apartment, you will get a beautiful sight all over Stockholm and a place for picknick. Everything one needs for a living is right around the corner. Lina is a perfect host, whenever we had questions, she helped and answered immediately. We will definitely book it again, when we come back to Stockholm.
"
3781,610948,20951148,2014-10-08,19921442,Kim,Lina er en svært generøs og sympatisk vert. Det var en glede å leie av henne. Leiligheten er utrolig hyggelig og ligger fantastisk fint til. Oppholdet mitt der kunne ikke ha vært bedre. 
3782,610948,21703674,2014-10-22,16533829,Isla,"We just got home from spending the most amazing week in Stockholm! Lina's flat was the perfect home for us while we were there. We love to cook and took advantage of her lovely kitchen. My boyfriend and I work remotely, and her main living room area offered the perfect environment to do so. The flat is conveniently located, only a few blocks from T-Bana and all of the restaurants, bars and shopping you could want. We were able to walk into Gamla Stan as well as all of the wonderful museums that Stockholm has to offer. You also won't want to miss the MOST AMAZING view of Stockholm located on a beautiful tree-lined walkway directly across from Lina's front door!

I can't recommend Lina and her lovely home enough!"
3783,610948,31427723,2015-05-05,11985664,Ashley,"Lina was the perfect host. She  welcomed us with a bowl of fresh strawberries, some Swedish chocolates and a broad array of travel pamphlets and helpful tips! We loved the apartment and the neighborhood--full of  great restaurants and parks with stunning views of the city. "
3784,610948,34119511,2015-06-05,28056310,Greg,"Lina’s apartment was ideal for our visit to Stockholm. We found plenty of space, especially the living room. All the essentials are there for a comfortable accommodation including excellent wi-fi internet for checking on touring arrangements and keeping in touch with home. We did eat breakfasts and light dinners in the apartment. The kitchen was suitably equipped. We did eat our main meal at lunch to take advantage of the hearty lunch specials offered by many restaurants at reasonable prices. The location was also excellent for our needs. Nearby are many restaurants, cafes, and a large supermarket. However, the location is just far enough away to provide a quiet environment with Stockholm residents. The apartment was also very quiet. We walked to all the attractions in and near “Old Town” and used the water ferry to reach others, such as the Vasa Museum. Public transportation is also nearby as well as taxi service, which we should have used after a long day touring. Lina was very helpful before the departure, and she met us at the apartment and provided helpful suggestions and information. She was also available if we had questions, etc. She did help with a phone calling problem and taxi service to the airport. Highly recommended for travelers wanting to experience Stockholm and Sweden. "
3785,610948,36993158,2015-07-03,26704602,Jonathan,"We really enjoyed our stay in Lina's beautiful apartment. Lina was very helpful and understanding when our arrival was delayed and gave us lots of great recommendations of things to see and do in Stockholm, including lots of excellent food recommendations."
3786,610948,41323348,2015-08-07,28062121,Jacques,"très bon accueil et très bon conseils de Lina sur le quartier et les environs. Lina a pris régulièrement de nos nouvelles et était très disponible. L'appartement est agréable, living spacieux et cuisine bien équipée, il est design et fonctionnel, et il est fidèle à la photo du site AirBnB. L'appartement est situé dans un quartier très agréable, commerçant avec toutes les facilités, et très sympathique pour passer de bons moments à Stockholm : savourer un fika dans un des nombreux cofee shop de SoFo !!! Faire son shopping dans un Design Torget… même la météo aura été favorable ! Nous recommandons vivement. merci beaucoup à Lina
Nous recommandons vivement"
3787,610948,43490218,2015-08-20,34593101,Sara,"Lina is a great host and we had an amazing week in Stockholm. From the very beginning, Lina answered all messages quickly and she was always very nice and helpful. When we arrived, she also provided us with lots of helpful tipps what to do in Stockholm and gave us a map of the area around the apartment, where she had marked some interesting places for us. During our stay she got in touch with us again to find out if we needed anything else, which was also very nice. 
The apartment is exactly as described and as shown in the pictures and it is beautiful, stylish and cosy, all at the same time. There is enough space for two people and you have everything you need there. Besides, the apartment is in a very hip neighbourhood with lots of things to do and see nearby. The old town and the modern city centre are also very close and so it never took us long to get anywhere. 
All in all, I wouldn't hesitate to stay at such a great place again! :)"

It has all the necessary things required for a comfortable stay. Lina is an very nice host. She was there to welcome me with her neat apartment. She was always in touch with me though on vacation and ensured I had a comfortable stay. She had a list to good to visit places around as well as some recommended resturants. Her collection of books on travel and living is awesome. Will recommend her house to all. "

3794,610948,160648896,2017-06-15,31611711,Kaitlyn,"Fantastic airbnb in a quiet street yet close to everything. Located in the best part of hip Sodermalm, and a short walk to Gamla Stan (though we personally preferred the less touristy Sodermalm, in addition to day trips to Vaxholm in the archipelago, time spent at Centralbadet in Normalm, etc.) Lina met us to give us personalized suggestions when we arrived. There are 3 grocery stores a block away, many thrift shops on a nearby street, very convenient. Flexible self checkout on our last day. The apt is of course beautiful with the kitchen having a view of the street where you can see the sunset and the living room having a view to lovely courtyard. Lina's apt was even better in person and had everything we needed for a week-long stay."
3795,610948,183667852,2017-08-18,11695552,Tatiana,"O apartamento da Lina e do Marcus é estiloso, agradável e muito bem localizado. Lina nos recebeu pessoalmente e explicou tudo sobre o apartamento e os arredores, dando várias dicas. O apartamento fica em Sodermalm, um bairro super trendy, perto do centro, mas ao mesmo tempo muito tranquilo. O metro fica a 3 quadras e também há vários supermercados, bares e lojas por perto. Não tivemos nenhum problema durante a nossa longa estadia de um mês. Nos sentimos em casa, foi uma ótima experiência. Recomendo muito."

The apartment is very organized and clean. Communication was excellent and the host was always available to answer questions during the entire stay. I highly recommend it and would definitely stay there again!"
3800,620848,2319847,2012-09-17,2290444,Ricardo & Carla,"A very nice appartment in a very pleasant location. Me and my family stayed for 5 days and we enjoy to stay in Älvsjö.  The flat is very near to train station (3/5min walking) but inside the house is very quiet. Close to the house there are green area, a pharmacy and 2 supermarkets.
Inside the house everything was available, also a rain coat for the rainy days:) 
The host Hanna was amazing, a very kind person and disposal at all times. She came to the airport and guide us to the house. She also gave us good tips to visit Stockholm 
I would definitely be booking again whenever i visit and would highly recommend for everyone, specially if you are travelling with kids.
"
3801,620848,2420634,2012-09-26,2280388,Julie,"I had a great time staying in Stockholm with this apartment as my base.  The property is close to the train station so was easy to travel into the city (about 15 minutes to Central Station).  The rooms were well furnished and comfortable, and there were lots of spare bedding and towels.  There was a good-sized TV and I believe there is equipment on the patio for a barbecue (sadly not tried).  The bathroom had a fantastic shower.  The kitchen was very well equipped and had a big fridge freezer (although I was very lazy and did not cook for myself during my stay).  In particular I thought Hanna was really easy to communicate with and very helpful, and she had obviously given thought to her guests being comfortable. I would happily recommend this apartment, and go back myself next time I am in Stockholm."
3802,620848,2505662,2012-10-04,3534401,Maja,"Absolutely recommendable. The appartement (two rooms, full kitchen and bathroom) is very cosy and comfortable and we felt at once at home. After sightseeing in the day we liked to come back in the evenings and watch tv or the dvd. It is a normal and nice appartment for people to live in, not something small made up for tourists. Everything is light and friendly. In the living room there is a baby grand piano with a good sound. Hanna and Keith received us with a very warm welcome. She met us at the central station, helped us to acquire our public transportation tickets (which is not as easy as one might think) und accompanied us to the appartement. There we also met Keith and we were received with a cup of hot tea. There was some bread, butter and cheese and some other foods in the fridge resp. the freezer, tea, coffee, oil and vinegar, salt and sugar and some other useful stuff in the fully equipped kitchen. There is a grocery store not so far away. The area is more a normal living area, for other shops or entertainment one would have to go into the city with the local train (commuter train) which goes quite often. The train station is quite close (a few minutes walk). From there one can also take a bus to the biggest IKEA. We also appreciated a basket in the kitchen with city maps and information leaflets. So if we would go again to Stockholm we would certainly want to rent this appartement again and we will recommend it to our friends."
3803,620848,2611944,2012-10-15,2474326,Terri,"Hanna is a brilliant host! Her apartment is adorable and felt so cosy and comfortable for our family of 4. It was spotlessly clean and she had stocked up the fridge and pantry for our convenience. Her communication is also excellent, always replying quickly. We were sad to leave our cute little apartment, we wanted to stay longer! Stockholm is wonderful and the public transport system is co close and user friendly. HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
3804,620848,2736435,2012-10-28,3393306,Lydia,"Really helpful and friendly people who answered all our questions very quickly. The appartment was clean and tidy and very well equiped with everything we needed for our stay. 

The location of the appartment is excellent, only a 20 minute journey into Stockholm Central (which includes the walk to the station).  We cannot rate Hanna & K's help or the appartment highly enough, would definately stay there again."
3805,620848,2825690,2012-11-07,3661582,Kamilya,"Hanna and K meet us at station  Älvsjö and showed us the house. The appartment is very cozy and beautiful. There are many useful things such as the raincoats, all ware necessary for cooking,candles, tee and coffe. Hanna and K bought products and very tasty rolls for a breakfast. They answered all our questions wenn we asked something about how to reach their house and all about transport im stockholm.We enjoyed our stay in this apartment. It is very convenient to reach the center. The train goes very often, even in the evening. Area near the house is the silent .3 minutes takes to reach supermarkets . we recommend Hannas home to all who wants to visit Stockholm"
3806,620848,2968132,2012-11-26,5636972,Лора,"It is the tremendous apartment, pure, very cozy in which there is all necessary for pleasant rest! 
The apartment to be near the station, the convenient transport message (Arland's airport or the city center).
 Hanna left to us many fresh and tasty products - I arrived at night and it was very pleasant! The drugstore, shop is a row. 
This apartment only for those who loves quiet and comfortable rest. I plan will return only to Hanna next time!  
Hanna & K thanks!
Это потрясающая квартира,чистая, очень уютная,  в которой есть все необходимое для приятного отдыха! 
Квартира находиться рядом со станцией,  удобное транспортное сообщение (аэропорт Арланда или центр города).

 Ханна оставила нам много свежих и вкусных продуктов - я прилетела ночью и это было очень приятно! Рядом есть аптека, магазин. 
Эта квартира только для тех, кто любит спокойный и комфортный  отдых. Планирую вернутся только к Hanna в следующий раз!  
Спасибо Hanna & K!

3807,620848,3060196,2012-12-11,3794334,Freddy,"Excellent experience from the second I booked. There was plenty of communication before the stay; and a very thorough walkthrough of the amenities at the apartment once the arrive. They helped us out a great deal when it came to suggesting things to do in Stockholm, and how to get there. The apartment was very spacious and well stocked as well. I wouldn't hesitate to book with them again."

3809,620848,3285729,2013-01-06,1679500,Roman,Hannas apartment is incredible large and well-kept. This and the previous communication (where she gave really good clues to explore Sthlm) made our stay really awesome. Hanna picked us up at the train-station (approx. 5min walk) and showed us her apartment. It was a perfect decision to discover Sthlm with an apartment only 2 stations away from T-Centralen or the Old town. We can recommend Hannas apartment in any! way and wish a pleasent stay in this wonderful city! :-)
3810,620848,3400450,2013-01-23,4214107,David,"We had the pleasure to stay for 12 days here in january.

IT has been a very nice stay with great flexibilty and everything in order! 

We felt very welcome and we will defenetly use this again.

The best and most cosy stay ever which we can absolutely recommend everyone.

3811,620848,3524280,2013-02-12,4126989,Bengt Olof,We stayed 10 days and we are very pleased. Hanna was helpful and the rooms were clean and fresh. There was nothing to complain about.
3812,620848,3567058,2013-02-18,2455468,Wim,"Staying at Hannah & K Lundholm apartment was an absolute pleasure for us! It's a 10-minute train ride from the city center, or less if you want to go to Södermalm. And trains come really often. The apartment is big enough to stay with 4. Everything is well equipped, sheets, pillows, towels, tableware... Internet is fast and the TV has enough channels. Communication was fast and clear."
3813,620848,4116602,2013-04-11,2455468,Wim,"Second time we stayed in Hannah's apartment, and again we had a wonderfull time! Close to the city and everything you need is available."
3814,620848,4374726,2013-05-01,5002807,Christelle,"Our stay in Sweden in the month of April 2013 went wonderfully, and in part thanks to Hanna! We were one couple with a child under three years and one other adult : we come to see our sister student in Sweden.
Hanna's apartment is conveniently located just 10 minutes from the center (central station). It is located in a residence on the edge of a large park that will delight families with children or just sports. Children's games are in front of the window, the train station to the center and a grocery store in 3 minutes. The apartment is spacious and warm, Hanna has not forgotten for the comfort of its guests, it feels like home ... In addition, she met us at the foot of the bus that took us from the airport to take us to the apartment, avoiding us to seek our way arriving in a strange country. It was also thought to leave some groceries in the cupboards and the fridge!
We spent a wonderful week of vacation and all we highly recommend this address. You can not be disappointed!
Thank you Hanna!
Christelle, Manu and little Lucien

3816,620848,4658992,2013-05-19,82169,Aradhana,"Hannah is a warm friendly person. She  communicated well with us before arrival but unfortunately we did not see her communication due to internet problems. However she was waiting for us when we reached and gave us detailed information about the apartment, city and neighbourhood. I have yet to see someone so thoughtful of the guests' needs thatn this couple. They had everything down to socks, gloves and umbrellas! The apartment was neat, spacious and comfortable.  They were large hearted enough to have the fridge full . We enjoyed Stockholmn thanks to Hanna's detailed brief . We mwet Keith on our way out. He was equally generous and warm. A big thank you'for making our visit memorable. The apartment is well located and easily reached by train and buses. We didn't miss a car at all. "
3817,620848,4826887,2013-05-28,4842230,Graeme,"Our first stay in Sweden, and what a pleasure it was to work with Hanna and K.  Very accomodating to our needs. What we enjoyed the most was the accomodation was just outside the city yet within  minutes of the public transport network, staying near the Älvsjö train junction eliminates waiting for trains to and from Stockholm. Facilities met our needs in every way, convenient stores close by, a great place from which to do day trips and a place to just chill out when your feet cannot take any more. Thanks H & K for making this a memorable experience."
3818,620848,5177004,2013-06-17,5591195,Karin & Nicolas,"Wir (Schweizer Paar, 40) waren mit der Unterkunft von Hanna & K rundum zufrieden. Von der Buchung bis zur Wohnungsübergabe und auch während des Aufenthaltes hat alles tip top geklappt. Hanna hat jeweils sofort auf Mails reagiert und war sehr zuvorkommend. Sie hat uns den Weg vom Arlanda Airport zu ihrer Wohnung sehr gut beschrieben (mehrere Varianten) und uns am Bahnhof in Älvsjö abgeholt (obwohl bereits abends spät). Danach hat sie uns alles Nötige über die Wohnung erzählt und die Schlüssel übergeben. Ebenso war der Kühlschrank mit den nötigsten Lebensmitteln gefüllt, Bad- und Küchenwäsche sowie Stadtpläne vorhanden. Die Wohnung wurde in sehr sauberem Zustand übergeben. Sie liegt ruhig gelegen, Nahe des öffentlichen Verkehrs (10 Min. bis Central Station, Verbindungen sehr gut).
Wir können die Wohnung von Hanna und K wärmsten empfehlen. Sie bietet alles, was es für einen angenehmen Stockholmaufenthalt braucht."
3819,620848,5292250,2013-06-23,5908101,Kara,"Hanna and K's was a wonderful place to stay! It was clean, comfortable and convenient. From the get-go Hanna was a great help, letting us know the best way to get to the apartment. She even met us at the metro stop and walked us to the apartment to show us around. It's just a few stops away from Stockholm Central station and a nice place to unwind after a day of sightseeing. Everything was great about our stay and I would without hesitation chose to stay there again. Thank you, Hanna and K!"
3820,620848,5433171,2013-06-30,6341683,Tom,"We had a wonderful stay in Hannah & K's home.  Hannah was extremely considerate in all she left for to use.  This was a tremendous help given we arrived late.  The home is a bit far form Stockholm, but the train connection is excellent and quick.  I definitely recommend getting a train pass.

There was a lot of construction in the area at the time of our stay, but this is of course temporary.  

Thanks again for your hospitality."
3821,620848,5731852,2013-07-14,6517967,Sog Yee,"Hannas flate was a very nice and quiet place to stay! It was very close to the Stockholmsmässan congress center  that we attended (5 minutes walk). The hosts Hanna & Keith answered all our questions via email and short messages within one day or few hours. In addition, they provided some cheese & thinks for the first breakfast which was really nice because we arrived at Sunday evening. Thank you both for the nice time in Stockholm! The air-condition was not perfect for us but it was ok after a while."
3822,620848,5880929,2013-07-21,5351321,Caroline,"When we arrived at Hanna's and Keith's place, Keith welcomed us and showed us the freshly cleaned apparment as well as the neighborhood. The appartment was great, we had dinner in the Patio and it had a Baby bed and a Baby seat for our 16 months old daughter. Since the Train Station is very Close, we could easily go and visit the centre of beautiful Stockholm. Hanna and Keith were very helpful and generous. Thanks for everything!!! Caroline with Kilian and Dana

3823,620848,6021927,2013-07-27,270122,Kim,What a treat. Quiet and large apartment with easy access to the easy to figure out train system. Hanna and Keith were super helpful and really gave us the lay of the land. Very good communication and our stay did not disappoint. I would stay there again. 
3824,620848,6580425,2013-08-18,5147124,Corinne,"We would like especially thank Keith who kindly waited for us in spite of a non-expected flight delay. He didn't also hesitate to show us the way to the very close and practical supermarket. 
The flat is very quiet, well-equiped and the bedding is great. Thanks to the weather we could have breakfast in the patio all the week. It's short distance from the railway station and it takes only 3 stops to join the city center (10 mn). All contributed to a great stay in stockholm which is an amazing city ! 
August 2013"
3825,620848,6872854,2013-08-28,7669878,Antonella,"We found the apartment very comfortable, Stockholm is easily accessible. The pantry was full, and this has saved us a lot of money. Hanna and K. have explained in detail everything we needed. There are all detergents and lots of soap. Although it lacks a drying rack, clothes dry-cleaned Manoi easily hung on a hanger in the bathroom. The temperature inside is very comfortable. Just one note:  there are not a basin and soap to handwash clothes . Sure the value of our holiday was increased by our stay in this apartment."
3826,620848,7066939,2013-09-05,6802608,Themis,"We were very lucky to find and choose Hanna's appartment for our staying in Sweden!

Hanna was very helpful from the very beginning; She answered to all our e-mails, met us in Stockholm at the nearby train station and showed us the way to her appartment.

I cannot think of anything that this appartment lacked of! It was cozy, comfortable, with clean towels and sheets, a refrigerator, microwave, and a dishwasher too. We were able to make our own breakfast - Hanna showed us the way to the nearest market, too. In a few words, we literally felt like home!

We had a wonderful stay, Stockholm is a beautiful city and Hanna's place made our trip even more comfortable and easier! We recommend her and her place for anyone who'd like to spend some days in Stockholm!"
3827,620848,7236687,2013-09-13,5900723,Jenny,"I have only praise for Hanna and K's place and the service they offer. Hanna was always available on email so making arrangements was easy and she provided lots of relevant information and will meet you wherever works best for you. 

The apartment is very convenient - very near to the station which has frequent trains - and also pleasant to be in - light and sunny.

Hanna generously has the fridge and cupboards stocked with basics so there is something to nibble and you don't immediately have to go to the shops (although they are so close that shopping for food is no problem).

Staying in their apartment made a weeklong Stockholm visit affordable and relaxing.  It was lovely after a day exploring to return to the tranquility of the apartment and trains came every 15 mins from Central Stockholm (and the train comes through
 Sodemalm too) .  And it is really easy to reach directly from the airport too. There is a huge forest park nearby if walking in nature is your thing.

Having a bed in the lounge means it is easy to share the apartment with friends and I was also there for 2 days alone and felt very safe.

For me it was the ideal place with the ideal hosts. Hanna was so concerned to make my stay  be as good as it could be e.g. checking whether I wanted yoghurt or bread and cheese (but in fact providing both options) and offering to come later on the day I was leaving, so she did not interrupt me.

Hanna met us at the local station to show us the nearest shop and how to get to the apartment. Transport links are good with a 10 minute journey on the local train to Stockholm Central, there is also a direct train twice an hour to Arlanda Airport. The apartment has a stock of drinks and basic food stuffs. The bedroom and sitting room are both large and comfortable. I would highly recommend this apartment."
3829,620848,10257519,2014-02-10,9371969,Henrik,super nice host. everything was settled when we arrived even with fruits and drinks. so happy about this stay.
3830,620848,10495911,2014-02-22,7463282,Richard,"The flat was perfect for what I needed.  With a welcome at the train station, I don't think they could be more thoughtful about what their guests need or could possibly want.  The place is nicely laid out with plenty of space in each room and it just instantly felt like a home.

Feedback was fast, helpful and they consistently went the extra mile to help.  I would simply thoroughly recommend this place - particularly if you are going to the Stockholmmassan conference centre which is a five minute walk.  

This was so much nicer than any hotel and the welcome set me up for a nice week.  Thanks to both of you."
3831,620848,13809626,2014-06-05,10337080,David,"This apartment was ideally located for us as I had a conference at the Stockholmsmässan, just the other side of the train station. It also would have normally been ideal for my wife and toddler to pop into town each day on the excellent train service, however the train lines were being maintained while we were there.
Hanna helpfully contacted me days before we arrived alerting us to this and giving alternative ways to get to the apartment and from there to the city via bus/metro. She even came out to the flygbussarna station in Liljeholmen to help us make our way by metro and bus from there and was extremely friendly and helpful.
I would think that when the trains are running as normal this would also be an ideal base for those exploring the city as it is only a very short train ride to the city centre, although Älvsjö itself is rather uninspiring.
The apartment was well equipped, spacious and there were several places to buy groceries and takeaways nearby, which was perfect for us with a small person.
Hanna was also happy to meet us much earlier than the listed check-in time, as we travelled all the way from Wellington and this was greatly appreciated.
Also appreciated and unexpected was that Hanna provided some basic groceries for us on arrival, making this more like a self-service B&B experience. 
The only small complaint was that we found the apartment needed a vacuum and my wife did this on arrival. However, in fairness, I think this was largely because we arrived early and despite going for a walk after dropping our bags off, may have rushed Hanna in her clean-up. Also, the previous tenant stayed 2 months, and I would have thought someone staying this long would have done some basic cleaning themselves. So we were not unhappy with this overall, and pleased we could check in on arrival in Sweden.
I would recommend future guests consider taking a bus from Arlanda airport to nearby Märsta station and the commuter train from here directly to Älvsjö if they want avoid the expensive Arlanda Express train service. We did this in reverse on the way to the airport when the trains were running again and it was less than half the price.
Many thanks, a very pleasant Swedish experience."
3832,624886,2455495,2012-09-30,3370455,Richard,"The perfect place for a family to enjoy Stockholm. It's hard to over-praise Oskar's place - we (two kids, two adults) had a fantastic week there. It's in a quieter part of hip Sodermalm but v near to both the Tunnelbana and a kid's playground. The flat is really stylishly done up - we wanted to move in oursevles. And best of all they were lots of great toys and books for our kids to play with. There's probably Stockholm's best Indian restaurant next door and for me a great vinyl shop just a few blocks away as well as the city and SoFo just a few metro stops away. Oskar was extremely helpful, sending us great tips on what to do (Djurgarden and the barnas rom at Kulturhuset are musts) and greeting us when we arrived. There was place for a pram downstairs, the lift was a great hit, and Oskar provided a travel cot for our youngest. All in all, a great stay and we were really sad to leave."
3833,624886,3104670,2012-12-17,4208012,Rebecca,"We had a fantastic weekend in Stockholm, and Oskar ad Lisa's apartment was perfect: beautiful, clean, spacious, close to public transport, and did I mention beautiful?!  It was warm and cosy, and our children really appreciated the boys' bedroom, especially with its bunk beds, books and puzzles.  Thank you, Oskar and family, for a lovely weekend.  We didn't want to come home!!"
3834,624886,3421674,2013-01-27,4213482,Mark,An awesome apartment. The spacious and bright living room and kitchen help to while away your Swedish winter blues. Oskar and Lisa are great hosts - friendly and quick to respond to any questions we had. I'd certainly come back here again. 
3835,624886,5903219,2013-07-22,4232588,Jon,"A bright and very nicely furnished apartment in a quiet, but conveniently located neighbourhood. Close to the metro, it is also a very pleasant traffic-free walk into the city centre along the waterfront. Langholmen island is a few minutes walk away (swimming, walking, wild strawberries, etc) and a city park and childrens' play areas are very close by. We really enjoyed our stay here. Oskar was very helpful and made sure we felt right at home. We can highly recommend Stockholm and this apartment too!"
3836,624886,9645446,2014-01-04,445930,Jeremy,Oskar and Lisa were great hosts and their place was great for a week in Stockholm. Most definitely recommended for those with young children as well as those without.
3837,624886,12064591,2014-04-22,9212297,Anne Cecile,"As a family of four (2 kids aged 7 and 4) we had the best week in Stockholm mostly because Lisa and Oskar apartment was the perfect home away from home. The area is just perfect, quiet with a great playground and a small island to wonder around nearby, the best bakery next to the subway (you reach any part of Stockholm very quickly) and the supermarket. The apartment itself is just perfect, beautifully decorated, bright, confortable, spotless and with everything you would need. Our kids loved the boys room with the toys and we had the best of time relaxing after wandering all day. Oskar was the perfect host and everything was easy to deal with. All our friends want to go to Stockholm and to Oskar's now! Thank you again we will come back."

Il était parfait pour nous avec 3 jeunes enfants qui pouvaient utiliser les jouets disponibles. De plus dans le quartier vous trouverez à proximité supermarché, restaurants, jardins publics avec jeux, plages et métro. Oskar répond rapidement à vos messages et demandes d'information. Je recommande vivement cet hébergement pour un séjour réussi sur Stockholm!"
3839,624886,17560042,2014-08-14,15617639,Sonya,"Oskar's apartment in hornstull was perfect for our family of two adults and two boys 5 and 8. We enjoyed breakfast every morning in the sunny kitchen, complemented by croissants from the cafe across the street. We ate pizza and dumplings in the neighborhood.  And we played soccer and minigolf in the large park nearby.  This is not to mention all the exploring of stockholm by bus and subway we did all week. Hornstull is a perfect location, easy access to the rest of sodermalm and the rest of the city too. The apartment was bright and sunny. Plenty of room for our family.  "
3840,624886,24857248,2015-01-03,15009004,Catarina,"Be at home of Oskar is like being in our house. It is the best compliment we can give. The house is lovely and has a light spell. I really liked the receptivity of Oskar, had coffee and chocolates to receive us. The Oskar was always very attentive and was always asking if everything was ok and if we needed anything. We travelled with our two kids and the best part of the trip was without a doubt the kids' room, they neither wanted to exit to the street, only wanted to be playing. Always We ate breakfast at home, going to the supermarket buy organic foods. The metro and bus is very close to home, as well as the airport shuttle bus. It was a fantastic ride and we are sure that everything is due to receptivity and sympathy of Oskar and his family."
3841,624886,33977677,2015-06-03,24393786,Rachel And Tom,"This apartment is very conveniently located close to Hornstull station.  We really enjoyed staying here and would highly recommend it.  It's comfortable, very quiet (no noise at all), clean, and safe.  Anyone staying in Stockholm with children will enjoy this cosy, child friendly apartment.  Oskar was quick with responses as well. Thanks!"
3842,624886,37441978,2015-07-07,22849807,Rose,"If your thinking about renting Oskar's apartment, then do, you won't be disappointed. It's a lovely big airy apartment in a great location. Short walk to the tube, supermarket (and a organic shop across the street) nice cafés, good outdoor swimming spot close by, and a lovely park for children at the bottom of the street. We stayed with out 18 month old son, the bedroom he had was blacked out (important in mid summer) with lots of nice toys for him to play with too! 
The apartment is tastefully decorated, with a really comfy bed. And everything you need to make your stay run smoothly. And it's really clean and tidy.
Oskar is good at communication making it easy for us to coordinate with dates and booking flights. 
Stockholm is a great city with so much do, for family's. 
I would totally recommend the city and Oskar's apartment for a great holiday. "

The apartment is spacious, spotless and beautifully decorated with a super fab (new) kitchen and very comfortable beds.  It was perfect for our family of four (two children aged 6 and 4). Our children loved their room with bunk beds and toys. Perfect location near everything - great restaurants, cool bars, transport, good shops, markets and nice parks - but on a lovely peaceful residential street. Oskar & Lisa were very welcoming, helpful and quick with communication. We highly recommend their apartment and would love to stay there again."

We were made very welcome and Oskar was responsive when needed.  Wonderful area close to the subway and great for small families.   "
3845,624886,92743758,2016-08-09,4788408,Susana,"Where do I begin? Oskar's apartment is everything you need for a perfect holiday and more! Sodermalm is the perfect neighborhood to stay when exploring Stockholm as it's well connected and packed with restaurants, shops, supermarkets and outdoor spaces perfect for young families like us. The house itself is better than the pictures show as some rooms have been redecorated to a wonderful taste, making it even more practical. Children's room packed with toys -our daughter always wanted to stay in!, and beautiful master bedroom, both very comfortable. Quiet street but close to amenities and public transport. Bus to/from Arlanda stops 2 streets away so it couldn't be better. I could go on for hours, so please do not hesitate and book this house when you next travel to Stockholm, it will make your holiday an unforgettable experience."

Connection to the airport and city center are very easy. It is a very nice place to stay if you want to visit Stockholm, nice walk by the sea to the city center and not packed with tourist. Oskar was very nice and helped us a lot.
"
3849,624886,175149620,2017-07-28,24974143,John,"Great apartment. Spacious. Everything needed for a family to have a good time in Stockholm. If you're going to all the attractions in djurgarden everyday, it's a bit far.

We had a blast and Oskar arrnaged everything needed for a good Stockholm holiday!"
3850,624886,179952560,2017-08-09,25504670,Daniel,"Un apartamento ideal para una pareja y también para alojarse con dos hijos pequeños. Comfortable, en una zona muy tranquila y agradable.

Muy bien comunicado. Tanto con el centro de la ciudad (Gamla Stan), vía metro,  como con el aeropuerto Arlanda, vía autobús directo que te deja a 3 manzanas sin tener que pasar por el centro (T-Centralen).

Oskar, te da indicaciones de todo lo que necesites. Yo repetiría sin dudarlo."
3851,624886,199168265,2017-10-01,15773718,Silke,"Vi boede i Oskar's lejlighed i en uge og var meget tilfredse med opholdet. Oskar har fra første kontakt været både rar og betænksom, han svarer indenfor meget kort tid på alle henvendelser og han og familien havde gjort lejligheden SÅ fin til vi skulle overtage den. Der var gjort plads til vores ting overalt i lejligheden og familien havde endda sørget for ekstra ting til vores mindste datter, fx en pusleplads på badeværelset og opredt babyseng i soveværelset. Som billederne viser er lejligheden meget smukt indrettet og placeringen er genial i kort afstand til legeplads, restauranter, svensk ø-natur, shopping, metro, mm. Alt i alt de bedste anbefalinger herfra!"
3852,624886,250194765,2018-04-04,11376579,Kristen,"We loved so much about this place! We are a family with two young kids and it was a perfect set up for our family with a great playground and park down the street and easy access to the Hornstull tbana as well as bus options. Oskar thoughtfully recommended we use the Flyggbussarna airport bus from Arlanda. What a convenience just a few minutes walk from the flat. We enjoyed exploring the neighborhood (if you are looking for a grocery store the somewhat hidden Hemkop in the mall at the Hornstull tbana had a huge selection of all kinds of goods, way more than the ICAs around.) We enjoyed some of the local restaurant options and getting a feel for neighborhood life. Transit wise, the Hornstull stop offered such great and easy  access to all of Stockholm, just 10 min or so to Gamla Stan. Our only advice would be to make sure you have lots of details about finding the apartment in terms of address and floor since we had some trouble finding the place. All in all a highly recommended location for a city stay in Stockholm, especially for families!"
3853,624886,253039166,2018-04-13,8781343,Anders,"There are not enough superlatives in the world to describe our stay. Everything was perfect. From the initial inquiry to stay in this gorgeous apartment to the moment we closed the door and dropped the keys through the mail slot. The apartment is stunningly beautiful and comfortable. The location is great, near public transportation, restaurants and cafes but also very quiet.  The host set the gold standard for hospitality - responsive, genuine, friendly and helpful.
If you have an opportunity to stay here do it, you will love it."

There’s a big grocery on top of the Train station, there’s a nice public playground around the block and  a few steps away you’re already at the water front.  The apartment itself is very spacious and tastefully decorated.  Staying in Oskar’s apartment gave us a good taste of how locals live."
3856,624886,279940673,2018-06-22,15952549,Shayne,This was our second visit to Oskar’s apartment and it did not disappoint.  Stylishly appointed and located in a great area.

3858,624886,290948436,2018-07-15,171161972,Anne,We stayed in Oskar’s appartment with our 3 kids. It was great! The location close to the city centre but in a quiet area with a lot of space to play! The appartment is beautifull and nice to relax. Oskar is a perfect host. So no complaints!!
3859,624886,297027302,2018-07-27,37207470,Patricia,"We were very happy when we booked this house for our summer holidays with our two kids of 3 and 7 years old. When we arrive at the house, Oskar was there for giving us the key and explaining everything. As the house has been remodeled, the pictures don’t match with reality but we cannot get disappointed as we were completely in love with the decoration and the stunning new and modern kitchen; as with the kitchenware and tableware. The house is full of different lights that transforms it with a cozy ambience. The kids bedroom with the bunkbed, toys and kids books was thrilling. The main bedroom is super spacious and has Apple TV as we have at home! It is a big apartment full of books. The building has a lovely garden were you can enjoy too with the kids or I would have taken a book just for reading in the calm environment. 

There is a supermarket just crossing the street and other at the metro station and bus station on a 5 minute walk. The Flygbussarna stop is also at 5 minute walk. A great park with swimming pool for kids at 2 min walk. A nice bathing area at 10 min walk with the cozy Loopen Marina, is a must for experiencing the Swedish summer bathing. The Italian restaurant “La casa” was much better than expected and we like it a lot. We seemed the location was great, we have enjoyed Hornstull and very easy to reach Gamla Stan. 

Even we have found cleansiness was not accurate, we completely recommend this accommodation and we were happy to repeat it as well. 

Oskar has been a great host. He has been replying and solving our dudes. I feel grateful they have shared the house with us. "

There were plenty of toys for our children to play with so they loved it!
We definitely recommend a stay here!"

3863,624886,369091053,2019-01-09,16187612,Bita,Oskar was an amazing host. We stayed over the new year holiday so we only communicated via text. He responded to our questions very quickly. The flat is beautifully decorated and updated. Our boys were delighted to stay in the children's room. They so graciously left their toys around for our kids to play with all week. This was really the perfect home for our family of four.

Good sized space for a city apartment, cosy feeling and cool decoration. Large fridge and well equipped kitchen.

The apartment is really nice and it's not that small: I am sure 3-4 people may stay there. Everything was included: towels, linen, hair dryer, kitchen equipment and even coffee and tea. The district is quiet and green -- we even saw three deers near the metro station. There are several restaurants and a supermarket."

Parking is free outside the apartment building which is very handy. While we didn't meet Anna, we communicated via text and the arrangements made for accessing the apartment worked out very well. Anna also left us some very helpful information in relation to subway maps and general information on the apartment. I would recommend this apartment. Thanks Anna  :)"

At the agreed point we met Anna and after a short introduction we took over the keys and ever since we enjoyed our stay on our own. The apartment was very nice, clean and airy.

The apartment is beautiful and you'll be glad you're not staying in a hotel in town when you're here. Book this place now, you won't regret it!"
3881,628555,6444073,2013-08-12,7776179,Nicole,"If you are looking for a place to stay in Stockholm, look no further! Anna's home really was a wonderful retreat for us. It is really well located, being just outside the hustle and bustle of the city... it's a relaxing place to come home to after touring islands or shopping. It's on a great Metro line which links to Central Station plus the other major stops and so it's super easy to get to and back. Anna's home is a 10 minute walk (or 3 min bus ride) from the Metro and the metro itself takes 10/15 mins to central stockholm. Perfect! Anna's home is really spacious too and has a wonderful Swedish designer feel to it - like staying in a boutique hotel. Anna herself was a wonderful host. She answered everything within minutes of us texting and gave us some great tips for restaurants, islands etc. We were staying a week in Sweden - Stockholm for 2 days, then canoeing in the country and then Stockholm again. After staying 1 night in Anna's place, we decided we wanted to stay there again when we got back to Stockholm. Anna was great! She approved the stay straight away, and also let us leave our bags etc in her flat whilst we went canoeing. This saved us so much hassle on our trip! Go for it - you wont be disappointed. We want to come back!!! "
3882,628555,6876844,2013-08-28,847178,Guy,"Anna's flat exceeded our expectations. It was only a quick 10 minute journey into central Stockholm and was located in a very safe, peaceful neighbourhood. Her apartment is beautiful and was immaculate. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Anna's apartment and only wish we had time to stay longer!"
3883,628555,8563134,2013-11-05,5814779,Jennifer,"Anna's flat is a lovely little space just a little outside the centre of Stockholm. It's the perfect place to start your expedition through this beautiful city. Anna's descriptions were very helpful, so we didn't have any problems to find her house, although she couldn't meet us in person. Everything went without any complications and Anna was just a lovely host! "

It was very clean and looked very stylish. Even though there is not a lot of room, you have everything you need - perfect for two people. 

The ride into town with the underground takes about 15 minutes. We always walked to the closest underground station which is another 15 minustes away, but it's a nice walk - we had great weather. 

I would really recommend staying the Helle! Thanks again!

3886,628555,53996369,2015-11-15,34222415,Corinna,"Our stay at Anna's apartement was amazing. Before we arrived, she already send us some information how to get to the appartement and whats good to know about it. We met her at the underground station near to the apartement and she welcomed us and explained some basic things for the apartement. It was very easy to find and super cozy and stylish. There is no bad thing to say about the apartement. We felt very comfortable and slept very well. The bed is wonderful! 
It's very easy to get to the city and takes about 20 min by bus and underground. 
Anna was always very cute and helpful and it was very nice to have such a kind host. 
I am already planning to go to Stockholm again in the summer maybe and would be very happy if I can stay at Anna's again :)

Although she was not in Stockholm, we kept contact for the whole stay. Anna also informed us extensively about public transport, the district of the apartement showed us a nice contrast to the old town and inner city. We would like to wish all clients of airbnb to find hosts like Anna with such a lovely and cosy appartement. It is a nice and safe district near to the center. Everthing was perfect, thank you Anna!"

We did not meet her, but she was very caring that everything would work well for us.
The little flat is not very central, but there are bus stops just around the corner, which makes it very easy to get everywhere.
Everything was perfect. Thank you Anna!"

The public transportation is wonderful- the T-Bahn station is only about 10 minutes walking from the apartment, and there is a bus stop right outside (all accessible with a SL transport card.) About 30 minute trip to get into the Stockholm city center. 
The apartment was lovely- accurate description, clean, and well-equipped. We were able to make ourselves feel right at home. The neighborhood is very cute, and there is a shopping center 10 minutes walking from the apartment. We were able to get all our groceries from the Co-op, the very nice supermarket nearby. 
I would recommend this apartment to any couple, especially anyone looking to be able to get away at the end of the day. It can be hectic to stay in some hotel in the city, but here you can just go back to Anna's and feel relaxed and at home. 
We had a very lovely stay and would love to stay in the apartment again anytime we are back in Stockholm. Thank you, Anna! "

Anna met with us really late due to our flights and organized a cab for us. During our whole stay, we had her apartment for ourselves. Everything was remarkably clean and the apartment itself is really stylish. 
The location is also really good, since it's really quiet and you can reach a big supermarket (coop) and the train station, from where it takes 12 minutes to town within 10 minutes of walking. 
We would totally recommend Anna's apartment to you, thanks for everything! "

It is quiet and well lit, it contains commodity needed for long or short stays, it is close to the transports (just a short ride from downtown Stockholm!), and the bed is very comfortable, which is a must after a long day of walking around the city.
Unfortunately, we didn't get the chance to meet with Anna, but she was quick to answer whenever we had a question and she gave us clear indications as how to get to her apartment. 
I would definitely rent her place again if ever I have the chance to visit Sweden again. "
3907,628555,158335747,2017-06-06,23869843,John,Great place for us during our short stay in Stockholm. Communication with Anna was very easy and we appreciated her helpful information on the area.

3910,628555,175580897,2017-07-29,26514447,Ian,We had a comfortable stay at Anna' place. They offer their own apartment which is in a peaceful neighborhood but you can reach city center by public transport in half an hour. Anna is super nice a host. She sent me a document to explain everything before our arrival. The bed is super comfortable. I definitely will recommend this place to all.

3913,628555,191708443,2017-09-08,19435693,Sophie,"Der Aufenthalt bei Anna hat uns gut gefallen. Die Wohnung war gemütlich und man konnte es sich bei Regen auch drinnen gemütlich machen. 
Die Küche hatte alles was man braucht, uns hat lediglich ein Wasserkocher gefehlt. 
Von den Nachbarn und der Straße hat man in der Wohnung nichts gehört. Lediglich die Fenster waren ein bisschen schwergängig zu schließen. 
Von der Wohnung aus war man schnell bei der U-Bahn-Station und war mit der Linie 14 schnell in der Innenstadt um diese zu erkunden. 
Die Kommunikation mit Anna war sehr einfach und unkompliziert. Sie hat schnell auf all unsere Fragen geantwortet und uns eine gute Anfahrtsbeschreibung vom Flughafen zur Wohnung geschickt, wodurch die Anfahrt keine Schwierigkeiten darstellte. 
Wir haben unsere Woche in Stockholm in Annas Apartment sehr genossen und können jedem nur empfehlen dort zu übernachten. 
Wem die Bilder von der Wohnung gefallen sollte auf jeden Fall mit Anna Kontakt aufnehmen."

The apartment is big enough for two persons to stay at and has everything if you want to have breakfast there. 
If you like (really) soft and big mattresses, this is a nice place to stay for you. In summertime I could recommend to take a sleeping mask with you, since there is a opening in the bedroom. 
The location of the apartment is out of the city centre, but if you, like us, do not spend much time in the apartment there is a metro station 12 minutes walking distance, so it's pretty convenient (also the metros go all through the night)."

Anna is well organised, answered always quickly and was very friendly and thoughtful.

3929,628555,306123332,2018-08-12,1708990,Beatrice,"We travelled to Stockholm for a family gathering which took place close to Anna’s apartment. It was very easy to communicate with Anna. 
The interior design is very, very well done, we (both architects) felt home and at ease immediately. The apartment is on the third floor (no lift) and clean. The neighbourhood is absolutely quiet; we have not heard any neighbours. From far away you can hear the freeway which was not a problem at all. The bathroom is really tiny – but the big bed very comfortable (I slept heavenly during the three nights). Although we did not stay much at the apartment, we enjoyed the comfy huge couch and the living room.
Anna, thank you for letting us stay at your beautiful place!

The apartment is much much better than what I could expect: very beautiful decoration and layout, equipment in very good shape, beautiful balcony with peaceful view...
The neighborhood is also perfect: it is near to KTH, a prestigious university. Very quiet, near to a grand park (if you do a circle running, it will probably take you more than 2 hours) and beautiful waterfronts.  "

3957,647119,6386255,2013-08-11,4791613,Florian,We had a wonderful time in this fantastic flat. It is decorated with a lot of love and you are living in the center of södermalm. The comunication with Mallika was without any problem. The rooms are full of atmosphere. A nice place to stay.
3958,647119,44628862,2015-08-28,9527281,Léo,"We had an amazing experience at Mallika's apartment! 

Everything is as described, and perfectly convenient. The flat is even prettier in real life. It's a perfect nest for 5 friends coming to Stockholm. The kitchen is loaded with everything (utensils, kitchen appliances and basics) a gourmet would like to cook with. We directly felt at home at Mallika's and the neighborhood was incredible. Mariatorget is a nice and trendy area nestled between the hip Hornstull and the popular Slussen-Sofo area, the perfect spot for a busy yet cozy stay.

Although we weren't fortunate enough to meet Mallika, the indications were very clear and communication perfect. We let ourselves in easily and she answered all our questions to help us. Furthermore she even let an architecture and nature guide to Stockholm that were very useful. 

Thank you so much for everything Mallika. This is a must-go!"

Very close to Mariatorget tube station. The flat is cosy and particularly the kitchen and the master bedroom are attractive. Mallikas is very helpful and easy to communicate with. Recommended!"
3961,647119,174170874,2017-07-25,6925705,Agustina,"If you are staying in this apartment and you take the bus Flygbussarna from the airport, you should take the route which goes to Liljeholmen and get off in Hornstull. There, you can take the underground to Mariatorget, which is just two minutes walking to the apartment. Once there, you'll find out that the apartment is located in a lively and nice area that is walking distance to the city centre.
The apartment itself is very cosy and welcoming, and it has even more than you could expect, as it is Mallika's own home. She was away on holiday when we stayed there, so we didn't meet her, but she was available by (Hidden by Airbnb) all the time."
3962,647314,2216698,2012-09-06,3116010,Carlotta,"I spent 15 days in the very big room of the Mallika's apartment. The flat is located in Södermalm, one of the best neighborhood of Stockholm, full of life, with lots of cafe, restaurants and pubs. The house is 3 minutes far from the metro and the street is very calm and silent, even if you are 5 minutes walking from the coolest part of the city. 
The apartment is really beautiful, with a kitchen fully equiped with everything you can need and the room is bright and spacious. I spent some days working home for my research and the place was perfect. 
Mallika is the best owner you can meet! She is very nice and helpfull and full of good energy that make you fill home after 3 seconds. She helps me to find places in Stockholm and suggest me things to do in this wonderful city.
I really loved to stay there!"
3963,647314,2288214,2012-09-14,3433375,Fernando,"We spent a few days in this cozy apartment located in the heart of Söder, the coolest neighbourhood in Stockholm. Trendy cafes, second hand shops or restaurants are just close to the flat. The closest metro station is around 3 minutes walking from it and it takes around 20 minutes walking to get the city centre. The apartment looks just like you can see at the pictures! Mallika is a great hostess! She makes us feel as at home and recommended us really interesting places."
3964,647314,2393225,2012-09-24,2003581,Wieke,"Me and my mother stayed in Mallika’s beautiful apartment for a week. Mallika is a very nice person with a positive energy. She gave us lots of great tips for exploring Stockholm. The location of the apartment couldn’t be better, it’s in one of the coolest areas of the city with lots of boutiques, restaurants and cafes. And within easy reach of the rest of the city, since the subway is just around the corner. Highly recommended!"

a nice host -
gives good advise -"
3966,647314,3242590,2013-01-03,1202420,Will,"Mallika entrusted us with her wonderful apartment. We spent nearly a week in Stockholm over the new year and the apartment was an ideal base for our time in the city. Unfortunately we didn't get to meet Mallika but we did get to have a cup of tea with her friend who called by to check we had settled in ok. 

Aside from the apartment not getting as much natural light as we had hoped..due to the time of year it was, the warmth and unique style of the interior more than made up for this shortfall.

We would happily recommend this apartment to fellow airbnbers as a comfortable and cosy stay.

3967,647314,4388214,2013-05-02,2646555,Amanda,"Mallika's apartment is beautiful, with high ceilings, lovely art, a cozy kitchen with a great window seat, a comfy bed (and I'm picky) and a nice feel all around. Not to mention that Mallika herself is friendly and welcoming - you can't go wrong :)  "
3968,647314,4561186,2013-05-13,4702427,Mieke,"Very nice  and clean B&B ( without breakfast !) in a quiet street. Located perfectly nearby trendy shops, cafes, metro en city-bikes.

3971,647314,4979715,2013-06-05,5034783,Hilke,"We were in town for the Stockholm Marathon. The location is simply perfectly located very close to a subway station. Easy to walk or cycle everywhere in the city if you feel like it. The apartment and the room you get is great, and Mallika helps you out with whatever you can think of. She's a good singer too, as she demonstrated in a live performance at one of the bars in Gamla Stan :-) She also helped us out when we had a minor medical problem on our flight to Stockholm.

In short, we had a great time. You should know though she has two cats, so if that bothers you, keep this in mind. It didn't bother us - we really didn't mind, nice animals!

Thanks again to Mallika for having us. Next time in Stockholm, we won't hesitate to come back!"
3972,647314,5012003,2013-06-07,3234703,Elise,"Mallika was a great host and even helped us find a Vietnamese restaurant close by when we were craving pho. The room is huge and really nice. This is a perfect home base if you're visiting Stockholm. Close to a beautiful park and a good walk into the old town. Allergy sufferers: there are two kitties who are very sweet and can be kept out of the bedroom, though I felt bit allergic even when they were kept out. "
3973,647314,5062776,2013-06-10,5621829,Jenny,"The room description was correct and the room is nice and spacious. In a good location also. The host slept in the living room which made it a little uncomfortable for us to use the kitchen (had to walk through the lounge, while she was sleeping). Don't go here if you don't like cats. Unfortunately, the host left unclear instructions on how to obtain the keys. She knew our time of arrival (1am) but didn't keep an eye on her phone, so when I called several times to ask for the key location, I got no answer, resulting in us having to book a night in a nearby hotel. Communication was a big issue with the host. Trying to communicate about getting one night's fee back because we couldn't find the keys was impossible. She simply choose to ignore me, which is very disappointing. I didn't even get a reply to acknowledge that she had received my emails (regardless of whether she was or wasn't willing to pay me back). Just nothing. Therefore, I would not recommend staying with this host. "

3975,647314,5244235,2013-06-20,931418,Mathilde,"We had a great experience staying four nights at Mallika's appartment at the end of June. Mallika is a very helpful host and sharing the flat with her was very easy. The room is very spacious and bright, nicely decorated, as seen on the pictures. She has two cats, but they're very easy going and they will not bother you nor enter your room if you dont want to. 

We specially enjoyed the neighborhood. Mariatorget is a charming area, full of cafes, beautiful shops. It offers some splendid panoramic views of the city. Apart from our arrival and departure (which were made very easy thanks to the metro station just down the block), we always walked to other areas of the city, or used the public bike system.

Mallika's appartment is the perfect place to start exploring Stockholm."

3978,647314,5825189,2013-07-18,6253174,Peter,"We spent a week there as part of a three-week trip around Sweden. The room was nice, spacious, quiet at night and with a comfortable double bed. It also has good storage and music speakers.
The kitchen and bathroom were well-equipped and easy to use.
The flat is well situated, close to metro station, restaurants, café's, parks and grocery store.
Mallika is an easy-going, kind and helpful host.
Wifi worked perfectly !"
3979,647314,5910989,2013-07-22,6553857,Sarah,"Mallika's apartment is every bit as gorgeous as the photo's show. It is so easy to get to from the Mariatorget subway station and peaceful and quiet at night. 
The room, and the whole apartment was spotlessly clean. Lovely fresh towels were provided and the wifi (being able to surf the net seems almost as important as being able to get a good nights sleep and get clean these days!!) worked perfectly.
The location is great as there is an excellent coffee shop on the corner and it is so easy to jump on the subway to get into town if you need to but as the weather was gorgeous, I had just a very lovely short stroll to Gamla Stan. 
Mallika herself is a very lovely lady. Truely I could not have wished for a better host; friendly, knowledgeable and helpful and puts you immediately at ease. 
Really quick and excellent communication, whether it was by email or text message which made the pre-arrival experience smooth.
I've had a wonderful weekend in Stockholm, thank you Mallika and your beautiful home for being a part of it! Sarah x"
3980,647314,6109460,2013-07-30,2054373,Elsa,Nous sommes ravis de notre séjour et de l'appartement très central et très convivial. La chambre est vraiment jolie et agréable à vivre. Mallika est très sympa et s'est rendue disponible lorsque nous avions besoin de ses conseils. Seul hic pour mon conjoint a été de devoir partager la salle de bain avec l'hôte car elle était présente pendant notre séjour... cela manquait parfois d'intimité mais pour quelques jours cela n'a pas été un vrai problème. Je conseille vivement un séjour chez Mallika !

The flat is as lovely and welcoming as pictured and is in a brilliant location for easy walking access to all that Sodermalm and Gamla Stan offers in terms of shopping, museums, historical sights, eating (I highly recommend Bistro Sud around the corner!) and generally soaking up the culture....

A great introduction to Stockholm!"

I bought a 3 day subway pass but ended up not using it much since every place I wanted to go to was walking distance. But when I did use the subway it was so convenient since there's a subway stop around the corner. 

The bedroom looks exactly like in the pictures and has a lovely view to the building courtyard. Mallika was very nice and helpful. There was no problem at all with sharing the one bathroom since she would always let me know if she would be using it for a bath or anything that took some time. Definitely recommend this place!"

Our bedroom was huge and the bed very big and comfortable!! The area of Södermalm is really cool, you find some nice bars and shops around here.
Her two cats Shadow and Ramses are friendly, a little bit shy, but very sweet, when they started to confide in us. 
We can absolutely recommend to stay in Mallikas flat, it's much better than every other standard accommodation."

She immediately made me (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication was very clear and responsive to changes of schedule - I appreciated that. Mallika even invited me to join her and friends at a local small scale music scene so I got a nice taste of the alternative side of Stockholm - the Södermalm that tourists wouldn't normally see.  I liked that a lot.

The apartment is pretty small which wasn't an issue for me because I had the lovely big and bright bedroom - very comfy.  The great thing about this apartment is that it is genuine old style Stockholm city blocks with very interesting ""quartier"" life all around.  You are so close (like 2 minutes walk either way) to either the T-Bana or the Pendeltag - you can whizz off anywhere you like within minutes or you can even walk into town if you want on a fine day."

Hun var god til at give tips og ville gerne snakke om aktuelle svenske emner.

Soveværelset var stort, rummeligt og farverigt med en god seng.
Lejligheden ligger dejlig centralt i forhold til det, som vi ville se i Stockholm. 

Det var en meget god oplevelse, som vi gerne anbefale andre."
4016,647314,14767636,2014-06-26,314656,Nando,"This may have been our most negative experience on AirBNB since I started using the service 4 years ago. Communication was extremely painful, the host was not accommodating and the burden of everything was generally on us.

She wanted precise hours of arrival and leaving – quite hard to do when you’ve only been to a city once. She had a complicated system of handing keys over, to the point that she expected us to learn it in person. Her listing describes a clean-up process that includes mopping floors, cleaning the (shared) bathroom and fridge, among others (she later clarified that was only for when she's out of town, but that's not what's on record), and a clean-up fee is not included.

Cancellation policy is strict. When we requested an emergency change, due in part to our mistake (misinformation about Midsummer schedules), she was unhelpful and irritable, accusing us of trying to do things outside AirBNB, to the point that we gave in and just paid for the unused night. Our last minute cancellation was directly linked to this type of behavior.

If you want a relaxed trip with no drama, please find another listing."
4017,647314,14809836,2014-06-27,4894858,Doris,"We had a lovely stay at Mallikas home in beautiful Stockholm. The bedroom was big, nice decorated and clean. The location near metro and many restaurants in Södermalm is also convenient. Stay there if you like cats :-)"
4018,647314,14947147,2014-06-30,2881997,Lisa,"Meine Mutter und ich haben drei Nächte bei Mallika verbracht. Es war unsere erste Reise nach Stockholm und wir haben uns gleich sehr wohl gefühlt. Die Wohnung von Mallika ist sehr gemütlich und wunderschön eingerichtet. Sie liegt im Viertel Södermalm. Von dort kann man sehr gut zu Fuß in die Altstadt laufen. Es gibt jede Menge kleiner Cafés in der Nähe. Wir haben unseren Aufenthalt bei Mallika sehr genossen. Sie hat uns viele nützliche Insider-Tipps gegeben. Ein Highlight war auf alle Fälle Ihre Geburtstagsfeier, zu der Sie uns freundlicherweise eingeladen hat. Für uns war es sehr schön neue Bekanntschaften zu machen. Wir würden auf jeden Fall wieder bei Mallika übernachten! "
4019,647314,16291840,2014-07-25,12896058,Frederic,"Unfortunately this has not been a great Airbnb experience....

The check-in went well as Mallika was ready to welcome us in the middle of the afternoon when our train arrived. This was perfect timing. When we arrived we liked the look of the apartment as it feels cosy and comfortable. Also I have to say that place is well situated.

However, things started to be a little awkward when she asked us to change the sheets of the bed when we will leave the room, as she was going to be out of town the day of our departure. As we like to be nice and accommodating with everybody, we accepted without hesitation...but it was still awkward as we knew we would also have to pass the vacuum, wipe the room and clean the floor (this is in the house rules. Make sure you read them).

As Mallika works and sleeps in the living room it can be little uncomfortable at moments if you are not used to share life with strangers. Also, as she had clients from 14h to 16h on the second day, she told us to be very quiet if we come to the apartment. This is not a big thing, but I think it's worth sharing with future guests.

During our stay, we did some mistakes, like forgetting to close and lock the second entrance door and misplacing stuff in recycle bags. When Mallika noticed, she came to us to make sure we understood how to do it properly the next time. This was little embarrassing and from that moment we started to walk on eggshells and we were not sure what we should and what we shouldn't do. In fact, this is why we did not appreciate this Airbnb experience as much as normally...

We have nothing against Mallika. In fact, we think that she's a nice person. However, during our stay, we were not super comfortable with some situations. Other people could react differently..."
4020,647314,16649707,2014-07-31,7456622,Ariane En  Tijs,"deze kamer is echt een aanrader! Ze ligt in een hele rustige buurt!, met vlakbij  winkels, restaurants,  koffiebars, ... Vlakbij was ook de metro  en de fietsparkeerplaats vanwaar we  gehuurde fietsen kon halen. We deden alles  met de  fiets (goeie  fietspaden in  Stockholm!) of te voet.

Mallika  had op voorhand alles duidelijk gecommuniceerd ivm  de kamer, de sleutel, de deurcode, ... De eerste dagen van ons verblijf was  ze zelf niet thuis, maar alles was prima in orde.

Mallika zelf is een hele fijne gastvrouw. Ze respecteert je privacy, ze hielp ons waar ze kon met tips, ... Echt een aangename persoon.

We zouden deze kamer zeker opnieuw huren als we nog eens in Stockholm  komen."

Mallika was very easy to be with and just let me get on with things. Loved the cat too!

Wir sind nur zum Flughafen mit der U-Bahn gefahren und sind ansonsten nur zu Fuß unterwegs gewesen. Es ist eine ansprechende Gegend mit vielen Möglichkeiten zu Essen und zum Shoppen. Stockholm ist großartig und wir kommen gern wieder.

4043,647314,30444733,2015-04-22,26917747,Caroline,Mallika's apartment was a great place for my sister and me to stay during our 4 days in Stockholm. The apartment was right where we wanted it to be in the center of Södermalm. Mallika was helpful and everything in the apartment was straight forward. 
4044,647314,30631760,2015-04-25,24338758,Gregory Ross,"We never got to actually meet Mallika but her flat was clean and beautiful. She gave very good instructions on how to get to her home from central station. She is located in a nice area of Soldermalm and is close to many shops and cafes. I highly recommend Mallika's home to others.
"
4045,647314,31295148,2015-05-04,27240857,Rebecca,"I can't say enough good things.  This was my first time using Airbnb, as well as my first time in Stockholm, and I am now an enthusiastic fan of both.  Mallika was the perfect host!  She is kind and thoughtful and knows the city well, so she gives great recommendations.  The restaurant she suggested served possibly the best meal of my life (""The Blue Door,"" but in Swedish - everyone in Stockholm speaks perfect English, so I never practiced my Swedish!) 

The room was better than the photos.  Her whole house is cute, but this room is like a little oasis.   Plus the neighborhood is great.  Because of this trip, I am now a proud fan of the following:

1) Stockholm
2) Airbnb
3) Mallika
4) Swedish men
5) Herring
"
4046,647314,32118508,2015-05-14,13859037,Eva,"Mallika lives in a very beautiful flat. The room to be rent is big and nice, the bed is very comfortable. Mallika was very helpful and hospitable. I enjoyed my stay there a lot and would book her room again when travelling to Stockholm again. "
4047,647314,33068764,2015-05-25,18086463,Lluis,"A) Nuestro anfitrión (Mallika), en ningún momento pretendió que nos sintiéramos ""como en casa"". El segundo día de estancia, mientras cenábamos en la cocina, nos comunicó que, en aras a la buena armonía de la casa, nos abstuviéramos de hablar entre nosotros dos (mi mujer y yo) porque le molestábamos. Esto nos alarmó y le preguntamos si podíamos hablar normalmente en la habitación y nos contestó que sí que podíamos. Quedamos más tranquilos; a partir de aquel momento 1) nos comunicábamos con susurros, si estábamos en lugares comunitarios y ella estaba en el 
piso, y 2) si estábamos en la habitación, hablábamos normalmente pero con cuidado para no molestarla.

El piso estaba muy limpio y ordenado.

B) La descripción del anuncio era correcta. La habitación grande y confortable, baño correcto i cocina correcto.

C) El barrio nos gusto mucho, tranquilo, céntrico, muy bien conectado por metro y por ferrocarril al aeropuerto"
4048,647314,34401152,2015-06-08,27008701,Giorgio,"We really think Mallika's apartment is in one of the very best point of Stockholm. The quarter is really cool, young, calm but also full of beauty small shops and place to eat (bakery, small supermarket). Underground station is just 2 minutes walking. Stockholm, generally speaking, seems always a safe city. 

The building is really good, the apartment is not big but the guest bedroom is really big (more then it looks like in photos). Interior design is warm modern swedish style (we liked it a lot). It's very clean and everything works well. The bedroom is full of light (and we liked it). For people who need total dark during the night, consider is not simply to totally avoid natural light during the night (in june day light is from 4am to 22pm) also shutting the curtains.

We were always out, so we did not live the apartment too much. For people who need privacy or want to stay a lot inside, must consider that to go to the kitchen it's necessary to pass through the living room where Mallika (only night time) sleeps in a curtain separated area.
This was not a big deal for us. 
Wi-fi works great.

We didn't use kitchen to prepare food but Mallika alway asked if we need it and explain how to use it. 
We always come back late, but no problem about noise for Mallika (of course we were not noisy..). 

The price is absolutely fair compared to Stockholm standard. In our experience we were surprised that Stockholm is cheaper then London or Paris."
4049,647314,35076250,2015-06-15,5426220,Heinrich,"Die Wohnung liegt ideal, sehr ruhig und doch zentral. Sie ist ausgesprochen geschmackvoll und interessant eingerichtet, das Zimmer groß und hell.

She helped us out with places to eat and things to do / see as soon as we arrived so we were able to maximise our time in Stockholm. Her flat is in a great location with enough restaurants and trendy cafes to suit every taste. We were easily (within 10mins) able to walk to both Gamla Stan and the unique fashion shops and bars of Södermalm. The ferry stop to the Vasamuseet is also a short walk away. Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable stay in a lovely flat with a top-notch hostess."
4054,647314,37665209,2015-07-09,21628506,Mark,Had a great experience staying in Mallika's apartment. Easy to get to from Central Station. The apartment itself is really cosy and homely.

It's quiet and lovely, and the location is AMAZING--the very heart of Sodermalm.

The Mariatorget part of Sodermalm is the perfect part of town to stay in and feel right at home, close to everything you'd need and a straight shot to the airport. Mallika was so easy to get in touch with and everything was just as we needed. Would stay again!"
4069,647314,46614728,2015-09-12,3169503,Kevin,"We enjoyed our stay with Mallika. The apartment is in an EXCELLENT location, in a fantastic neighborhood next to one of the best coffee shops I've ever been to. It is a very nice, short walk into Old Town and the rest of central Stockholm. And the neighborhood is surprisingly quiet at night such that sleeping with the windows open poses no problem. The only issue was that I was woken up when Mallika left the apartment early our first night of sleeping (around 3am) for travel; this made it very hard for me to get a good night's rest the first night, although my wife was able to sleep through it."

4083,647314,57657643,2015-12-28,31476284,Natalie,"We only spent the first evening with Mallika before she left for vacation, but she was very welcoming, immediately made us feel at home and showed us where everything was that we might need. Her apartment is stunning - we were so happy to spend Christmas in such a beautiful place. The room was even bigger than it looks in pictures, with tons of natural light and a very comfortable bed. It was a great location - there were plenty of bars and restaurants right around us, and a grocery an easy walk away. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go in the city. I would highly recommend staying in Mallika's beautiful home! "
4084,647314,58045446,2015-12-31,13704010,Wiske,"My mom and I really enjoyed our short wintery stay in Stockholm at Malika's apartment. We didn't get to meet her, but Malika was always ready to answer any questions via email.  
We absolutely love what she did with the place; it's comfortable, very nicely decorated and homely. Furthermore, set in the vibrant Södermalm district of central Stockholm, the apartment is excellently located. Especially if you are looking for a place close to small, inviting boutiques, which focus on design and vintage, and good value places to eat that the locals themselves would frequent.
We will highly recommend it to our family & friends, and we are already looking forward to staying here again! "
4085,647314,59905757,2016-01-17,50102588,Lena,"Wir wohnten für eine Woche in Mallikas Wohnung in Stockholm und genossen diese Zeit sehr. Die Wohnung beinhaltet alles, was man so benötigt, das Bett ist schön gross und gemütlich und als positiver Nebeneffekt ist die Wohnung wirklich schön eingerichtet und sauber. 

Gleich um die Ecke liegt die U-Bahn-Haltestelle und nur ein paar Schritte weiter der Supermarkt. 

Wir können Mallikas Unterkunft nur weiterempfehlen!"

Elle a ete très flexible quant aux heures d'arrivée et de départ, ce qui nous a bien aidé. La chambre était identique aux photos, l'appartement d'une propreté impeccable, en plus d'être parfaitement localisé dans le tres hip Sodermalm, a une distance de marches de plusieurs café, stations de métro et plus encore."
4087,647314,60967235,2016-01-30,22900003,Jay,"Just like the picture--this is a spacious room. Mallika is a gracious host, and was always available for questions and to make sure my arrival was easy. Just a block and a half from the Metro (hint--make sure you exit the correct direction; read the directions Mallika sends to you). Ramses is a very friendly cat. Nice neighborhood. Highly recommended. "
4088,647314,61637633,2016-02-07,34894526,Lyne,"The location, with just a few steps away from a underground station, was perfect to explore Stockholm. The whole apartment is cosy and quiet, perfect to chill out after a strenious day of sightseeing. Södermalm is a charming neighbourhood full of bars, cafés and small shops.

4092,647314,67060035,2016-03-26,16175183,Catalina,"El Barrio es en el centro de la ciudad muy cerca al (Website hidden by Airbnb) habitación es tal cual como aparece en la fotografía. El baño es muy cómodo. 

Sin embargo, para alguien que viene viajando mas de 16 horas y luego unos cuantos trenes y metros en la ciudad es  bastante duro ser recibido, en la fría ciudad de Estocolmo. La calefacción es bastante precaria. Y la anfitriona no es amable. 

Comparado con otras experiencias previas en habitaciones privadas en Grenoble, París, Bretaña,  a donde asisto regularmente a conferencias, creo que a la anfitrióna le falta calidez y amabilidad. La habitación no es el lugar  adecuado para trabajar y concentrarse cuando en el caso mio vengo para preparar una conferencia.  La habitación es muy cara y muy restringidas las  posibilidades de utilizar demás espacios como sala y cocina."
4093,647314,67531372,2016-03-30,57026746,Amy,My friend and I had a great stay at Mallika's. She was welcoming and helpful - kindly suggesting places we could visit and local restaurants.

Her neighborhood was peaceful and charming, but only a block away from great cafes, restaurants, and boutiques. Her apartment was clean, spacious, and inviting. Mallika was a very warm host, who gave us great tips and even helped us with booking a day trip to the islands. We also loved her cat, Ramses, who made the experience even more fun. "

Wir haben Mallika nicht wirklich kennengelernt, aber sie war sehr freundlich, immer zu erreichen und sehr hilfsbereit. Man sollte wissen, dass sie 2 Katzen hat, die in der Wohnung bleiben. Wir hatten damit kein Problem. Der Stadtteil Södermalm mit den vielen Shops, Cafés und Bars hat uns super gefallen und wir können die es absolut empfehlen! "

The bed is comfy, the room is big and bright, and the cats are adorable! Both cats are super friendly and love attention but listened when they were asked to leave our room. There's a nice tea kettle which came in handy after a day in the cold, and a nice kitchen, although we didn't end up using it. The location was a good spot in Sodermalm, which has a lot of restaurants, bars, clubs and young people. Its very easy to walk around Stockholm, but if necessary the metro stop is a few steps away around the corner.  Overall we had a great experience and would definitely recommend! "

The space is as-advertised and the room is comfortable with lovely decor and tea and water in the room. The location is excellent and close to Gamla Stan. 

I had some trouble with checking in, as the safe for the key is a bit confusing as it is not a typical digital safe, but a kind neighbour was able to help me unlock it and Mallika followed up soon after. Otherwise all went smoothly :)"

Puedes caminar facil a todo, pero si llevas maleta de rueditas llegar caminando o salir caminando es un terror jaja
Viven dos gatitos, lindos pero un poco metichillos, metieron sus patitas dos veces a mis vasos de agua y se llevaron mi esponja del baño.
Es piensas en este lugar para salir de noche y regresar tarde no es la opción porque les gusta dormir maximo 10pm
Si eres un maniatico de la limpieza, tendras un par de temas porque hay algunas cositas tantito polvientas.
Todo lo demas perfecto, pregunta a la host por el codigo de seguridad de la entrada y el piso para llegar al depa o te perderas :)"

The location is perfect: a short walk to Gamla Stan (10-15 minutes) but still far enough into the low-key and locals-dominated Södermalm that you avoid the tour groups and noise that occupy other parts of the city. Keyless entry into the building makes check in easy, and the apartment had more than enough layers of security to make us feel safe. 2 blocks from the Mariatorget stop, it is also easy to access other parts of the city by metro. (BTW, the bakery around the corner - Bageri Petrus - is amazing and definitely worth the visit... every day). Thanks again, Mallika, for the wonderful stay!"

지하철역과 상당히 가까워서 교통이동이 매우 편리했고, 집근처에 맛있는 빵집과 음식점, 편의시설들이 많아서 좋았습니다.
숙소는 사진상 봤던 부분과 거의 유사했고, Mallika와 직접 만나지 못해 아쉬웠지만 대체적으로 물음에 늦게라도 성의있게 답변해 주었습니다.
쾌적하고 깨끗했으며, 간혹 주변소음이 있긴했지만,
편안하고 안락한, 아기자기한 숙소였습니다:)"

Checking in was very easy and Mallika always responded (using airbnb chat) within five minutes if we asked for something. 

It is probably the best place you can stay if visitng Stockholm :-)"

 Her home is pure medicine for anyone who loves originality and style. 
Mallika's friendly way and eagerness to give tips regarding the area makes one feel welcome and immediately at ease. 
Hope to return to this oasis for the spirit right in the centre of groovy Södermalm!! I loved my stay!"

4168,647314,196949285,2017-09-24,23391169,Geraldine,"Thank you Mallika :) 
We spent a nice stay at your home. This last one was tastefully decorated and very well situated (ver close to the centre- 15 minutes on foot) and in a very vibrant district (Sodermalm). What we really appreciate was the flexibility offered by Mallika when departing: our last day we were allowed to leave our luggages in the entrance and pick them up later, before taking our filght in the evening. Such a joy !  Thank you for that !! Great value comparing the others airbnb, I recommend it !! If I had to restrain a negative point: I would say that we just regret the lack of privacy (perhaps more suited to friends than for a couple). But more positives than negatives !"
4169,647314,199535218,2017-10-02,1456048,Madhuri,"Only a block away from the Mariatorget T stop, Mallika's apartment is the perfect base for exploring Stockholm. We walked around Södermalm and took short metro rides elsewhere. 

The room itself is whimsically decorated, clean and cosy. The shower's water pressure isn't the best and the bathroom a bit poky, but it's an old building, I understand.

It was easy to communicate with Mallika prior to our arrival as well as during our stay. This review would be incomplete without mentioning Ramses, the world's friendliest cat. He hung out with us at night, sprawled at the foot of the bed, and it was the best!"

Around the corner from the metro, surrounded by cool coffee shops and restaurants, all while maintaining a quiet neighborhood feel. It's only 2 metro stops from Old Town but also close enough to walk, about 30ish min. The flat is also HUGE. Has everything you would need. I regret we didn't stay longer. Highly recommended!"

The unit itself is impeccably designed, so memorable and cute. You won’t want to leave the living space! Mallika was kind, and easy to communicate with.

4237,688947,4442111,2013-05-06,2375932,Karol,"That is a lovely place to stay! Flat is located in quiet and beautifull area. It's close to supermarket and 10min by car to the city centre. There is nice garage next to the house, where you can leave the car for 20SEK/24h. Alexandre is very positive and friendly person, we felt great in the flat and had more than enough privacy :) There is good WiFi connection and fully equipped kitchen. We recommend this place to everyone travelling to Stockholm.

One night he some of his friends came to play music, he invited us to eat barbecue with them and we spent a great evening and they left early so that we could sleep. His son Bruno was also at home, he was very nice and funny, and didn't disturb us at all.

We had a wonderful time and highly recommand Alexandre to anyone who wants to spend a great time in Stockholm ! "

Alexandre is a great host, he tried to make us feel like home, and he did it. "
4247,688947,6731622,2013-08-23,4403707,Regina,Alexandre`s apartment is in a quiet and beautiful district of Stockholm. We stayed there for three nights and we totally recommend his appartment if you are going to visit splendid Stockholm! :)

4250,688947,7550000,2013-09-24,7395011,Emanuela,"Alexandre has been very kind and helpful, but the house for the amount paid, would be much better. the house was not as clean as we expected from the reviews read, and the subway farther than it seemed. The second bed (on the floor) was very uncomfortable, infact my partner has suffered backache all the time. For these reasons, i'm sorry but I don't feel to recommend it."

The room was clean, big enough. Alexandre is sleeping on the couch in the living room, No problem with that 
NIce place to stay"
4254,688947,9623045,2014-01-03,10781164,Károly,"We really enjoyed the time at Alexandre's place. Alexandre was really helpful and kind, he gave us a lot of suggestions regarding sights to see, restaurants to eat, and places to discover. The flat is really nice, clean and fully equipped. It is easy to reach the center of Stockholm by subway. We spent some beautiful days there around New Years. We absolutely recommend him and his flat for others!"

4258,688947,12825468,2014-05-12,3210510,Paulina,"The place is well decribed by Alexandre, so nothing will surprise you - if so, only in positive way! Very welcoming and nice host, who didn't get upset even when I accidentaly broke a plate. The place was clean, cosy and easy to find. The nieghbourhood was ok - a typical dormitory suburb, but easily accesible from the city centre. The only slight disadvantage (for me) was a strong incense smell in the apartment, but it's a question of your preferences. Overall, a very good experience! Thank you, Alexandre!"
4259,688947,13789176,2014-06-04,2338406,Marko,"Alexandre was good host, kind and nice. Room was as described, neighbourhood was nice. Location is good, 5 minutes walking to metro station. "
4260,688947,14289130,2014-06-16,6688859,Jiun Yi,"Alexandre is a really cool host who is very easy going and great to chat with. We were supposed to check out in the morning but he was very kind to let us leave our bags at his place till the evening. He also recommended Natalie's pizzeria which is just left off the metro station which serves great but affordable food. His flat is extremely clean and welcoming and our beds were very comfortable. This was one of our best airbnb/hostel experiences. Thank you Alexandre! :) 
"
4261,688947,14519263,2014-06-21,32918,Patricia,"Alexandre's flat was very conveniently located, just a few minute walk from the t-banna. The neighborhood is very quiet, so getting a goodnight's sleep is no problem. Alexandre was very nice, provided maps, and gave us some museum recommendations. Also, there are two grocery stores nearby!"
4262,688947,15214558,2014-07-05,14575561,Petr,"Alex is really nice person. There were no problems with communication before arrival and during our stay. Appartment is exactly the same as described, so there wasn't any negative surprise. It is clean, it is located in really silent part of the city. It is near subway, so you can get to city centre quickly."
4263,688947,15339831,2014-07-07,387036,Ana,"Alex was a great host! He was flexible about arrival and departure times, he made sure that we had everything we needed, and he even provided Stockholm maps and brochures. The apartment is just as pictured - and it was very clean. It was in a safe area with nearby grocery store, post office, and other shops, and only about a 20-minute train ride into the city. Great visit!"
4264,688947,16087429,2014-07-22,13585331,Kavin,"Alexander's place was clean and cozy.  I liked sleeping on the floor mattress, as it was firm and felt good for my back.  The place is located outside the center, but very easy to get to with a nearby metro stop.  
Also one day, Alexandre and his friends were rehearsing some Brazilian songs, and we really enjoyed listening to it!"
4265,688947,16216161,2014-07-23,17099639,Pim,"Lovely home with peace and silence, the name itself says it all. Really friendly host and a quiet neighborhood to stay. Recommended place to stay also because Alexandre is a really friendly and awesome guy."

I would definetely recommend this place."
4269,688947,18505486,2014-08-27,20266909,Tatiana,"My name is Tatiana and rested with my husband Artem in Stockholm at the end of August. We stayed in the apartment of Alexandre. His apartment is located in 20 minutes by subway from the city centre. Access is very easy. Alexandre friendly musician from Brazil. His apartment is very cozy and clean. Everywhere the spirit of South America, which makes its own intrigue. We were very comfortable and welcome."
4270,688947,18913063,2014-09-02,19700431,Gemma,"Alexandre was an amazing host and is genuinely a nice, friendly person. His house is as described - a really nice house in a quiet suburban area just outside of Stockholm. I would definitely return and would highly recommend! "
4271,688947,18968321,2014-09-03,20515305,菁,"It was really a nice experience stay in the house of Alexandra. Though it is not a big one, we felt quite comfortable. With the peace and fresh environment. And also the price is really reasonable! "
4272,688947,19017189,2014-09-04,20515124,Catherine,"It's a really lovely apartment,has a cute small garden,and Alexandre is so nice and hospitality,we do some easy cooking at home.He had invited us to join in the  local misical party,so nice man."
4273,688947,19694974,2014-09-16,18191214,Ondrej,"Bydlení u Alexandra bylo velmi čisté a pohodlné. Měli jsme malý problém při příjezdu s klíčema od bytu, neboť Alex byl ještě v práci a dle domluvy jsme se do bytu nedostali. Nakonec se ale vše bez problémů vyřešilo a od té doby se žádný jiný problém nevyskytl. Bydlení jsme měli téměř celou dobu sami pro sebe. Byli jsme velmi spokojení."
4274,688947,20956944,2014-10-08,19947082,Mona,"The Airbnb Slogan ""Welcome home!"" totally fits at Alexandres fresh home with peace and silence. Once you arrive, you feel home, and thats for sure, especially of Alexandres warm and good-natured heart. I stayed with my best Friend for one Week and it was such an nice and peacefull experience there. When we arrived, Alexandre showed us the cosy, warm and very cleaned rooms of his small flat, and after that he had invited us to his Bandproofing near his house. It was fun, getting in touch with him and his friends very soon after arriving. And his Band is very awesome, that was a first great experience of our stay! In his cosy flat we have felt very welcomed the whole time.  The bedroom which is provided for his guests, is likewise all the other rooms very clean, cosy and you get a very good sleep in there! Erverthing as described in here. The neighbourhood is very quiet and as he described, peacefull. So you have a nice place to relax from your daily trips into the city of Stockholm. And Alexandre bothers about your needs and cares, he is an awesome guy with the heart on the right side. One evening he tooks us to his favorite jazzbar, to show us the nightlife of gmala stan and it was such a great evening there! He and his friends are so nice and pleasent, we're so happy getting to know some of them. We really miss the time at his flat, besides to a comfortable room during our stay we have found a really good friend in Alexandre, which  we already miss alot. He has such a great living philosophie, which we're taking with us back to germany. I only can recommended Alexandres home to everyone, who is interessted to a friendly and open minded guy and looking for  a peaceful home for a short or longer stay in Stockholm. Just feel welcomed at Alexandres very cosy home, with so much positive energy and gain! We will return for sure! Thanks for everything, Alexandre ! :) <3"
4275,688947,21303557,2014-10-14,19304068,Adrien,"I and my dad visited Stockholm for a few days and had the chance to stay at Alex's place. His apartment is definitely as pictured in the description, peaceful, clean and very well-located since there's only about 20 minutes to get to the centre town ! Alex is a friendly guy, he gave us some tips and as I told him, he's a great promoter of Sweden ;) Besides, he's a fine music connoisseur, which highlighted for sure his apartment's great vibes. I highly recommend him !"

Die Wohnung ist sehr gemütlich und man findet dort alles was man braucht. Man hat dort eine herrliche Ruhe und dennoch ist die Anbindung an die U-bahn sehr gut. Auch ein Supermarkt ist gleich um die Ecke. 
Thank you for your confidence!
Greetings, Teresa & Birte"

4280,688947,42758808,2015-08-15,13200291,Laurie,It was great. Exactly as described. Alexandre checked with us regularly.
4281,688947,44207923,2015-08-24,41054438,Bojana,"We had wonderful time in Stockholm. Alexandre's apartment is beautiful and clean, in a great neighborhood. It is not far from the center. Alex is great guy and excellent host, communicative, relaxed and very tolerant. We are sorry we didn't have more time to stay in Stockholm. We would definitely come again and stay in this apartment and we recommend it to everybody. "
4282,688947,44713494,2015-08-28,27707119,Rebecca,"it was a clean, warm and very comfortable place ! even though we didn't met alexandre, because he was out, he was willing to help wherever he could and asking to give us a comfortable stay at his flat."
4283,688947,45324786,2015-09-01,41928801,Alonso,"Staying at Alex's place was awesome! He helped us a lot with our trip and made our trip great. His place is clean, nice, comfy, feels like home. If you are planning on staying in Stockholm his place is def the place. A few steps from the Metro Station and 10min from Central Station makes the location awesome. Very happy we chose his place as our place to stay and looking forward on staying there again when we come back. In a few words: nice, friendly, safe and quiet community, charming, happy, and reliable. Definitely 5 stars :)"
4284,688947,45734665,2015-09-05,19747722,Pawel,"We spent 3 nights at Alex place. He is very friendly host. He welcomed us cheerfully and gave an extra mattress. Alex is unusual guy as he agreed to host us three people. He is very optimistic person what we noticed from the first sight. He worked in the very morning but still stayed in contact with us. Alex is definitely host that I can recommend. Just great, thanks!
Room was very clean and whole apartment tidy as shown on pictures. It is located few minutes walking from metro station and then ca. 15 minutes to central bus terminal. ICA supermarket is on the way to metro.
Hey Alex, sorry for that cooking quite late..."
4285,688947,46308127,2015-09-09,40472238,Gilles,"Bonne situation (à moins d'une demie-heure du centre de porte à porte), endroit calme et propre. "
4286,688947,47215816,2015-09-16,20994665,Su Fen,"Communicating with Alexandre from the beginning of my booking to the end of our stay was great.  The room is exactly as you see in the photo, simple, bright and clean.  The bathroom is also very clean.  My partner slept on a mattress on the floor as the bed is only a single bed but both of us were very comfortable and felt at ease in Alexandre's home.  The weekend we stayed Alexandre had his son over but both of them were very quiet.  Alexandre's home is an easy 10 minute walk to the nearest T-bana station, Skarpnack, and your ride will take you just over 15 minutes into Stockholm central.  Alexandre's home is definitely value for money as although you need to take a train into town, you will definitely not find as nice or clean of a hostel in the city center.  "
4287,688947,47522978,2015-09-20,42860992,Zoltan,"Minden a legnagyobb rendben ment!  Ez volt az első alkalom, hogy az Airbnb-t vettük igénybe. Jó volt a kommunikáció a bérbeadóval. Tiszta, frissen mosott ágynemű és törölköző várt minket. A szoba egyszerűen berendezett volt, de tiszta és nagyon barátságos.  Nem belváros, de jó volt a közlekedés. Az egyetlen negatívum, hogy a 2. személy egy matracon a földön alszik.
Csak ajánlani tudom minden Stockholmba utazónak."
4288,688947,48339806,2015-09-25,1376992,Sophia,Alexandre took us in when our original host cancelled on us last minute. He replied right away and made us feel very welcome from day one. The room and bathroom is clean and the apartment smells of incense. 
4289,688947,48923112,2015-09-29,24099208,Selma,"Our host was really friendly, he did more for us than he had to. Everything is exactly as described and as in the pictures. Neighbourhood is really nice too and Alex has a nice garden. Just to avoid confusion, maybe it should be added that when you leave the metro station, you go 600 m (3 blocks) to the RIGHT. Place is not hard to find, it takes you 25 minutes to Central station. If not there, Alex will be available to you via his phone number all the time. 


"
4290,688947,49654099,2015-10-05,43501634,Lindsey,Alexandre was a great host and made sure that my friend and I felt very welcome. His internet was out when we were there which was unfortunate but also not his fault. The beds were very comfy. Overall we really enjoyed staying with Alexandre. 
4291,688947,52505542,2015-10-30,45292665,Miriam,Nos acogio muy bien 
4292,688947,55633974,2015-12-03,18370331,Alex,We had a nice stay at Alexandre's. He was welcoming and made sure we had everything we needed. It was pretty easy to get into the centre with T-bana.
4293,688947,66299329,2016-03-20,7470006,Mio,"Alex is a super nice and chilled host and his place is conveniently located and clean. I fell in love with this apartment on first sight, it's very zen. Check-in and check-out went smoothly. My recommendations!"
4294,688947,67910654,2016-04-01,38802721,Rainer,"Alexandre's place was very cozy. It has all you may need for your stay. There is a park, a shop and metro stop nearby. Would surely recommend to anyone."
4295,688947,69178561,2016-04-09,63295030,Veronica,"Con Alex fue todo sencillo desde el primer momento: Nos facilitó el parking, nos dio libertad y nos ayudó en lo que necesitamos. El acceso al centro es muy rápido y directo. El barrio es tranquilo. La casa es cómoda, limpia, ordenada y la cocina es muy completa; sólo tuvimos la mala suerte que el wifi estaba en reparación. El resto sin inconvenientes. Recomendable."
4296,688947,72626936,2016-05-04,67019232,Arek,"Alexandre is a very helpful and outgoing host. We couldn't choose a better place to stay in Stockholm. We lived in a very peaceful, green district, 17 min. from the old town (subway, no. 17). Thera are some shops, park and sport grounds in the neighbourhood. We had our own room and a full access to kitchen and bathroom. Alex gave us keys to his apartment and for our convenience he even spent the nights by his friend. We strongly recommend this host to all travellers! Thank you Alexandre! Best regards!"
4297,688947,73443101,2016-05-08,12421879,Solenne,"My friend and I spent 4 days in Stockholm, staying at Alexander's house. We were very well welcomed and Alexander was a nice host.
His son was there but they didn't stay long so we had the whole apartment for ourselves during 3 days and anyway it was really not a problem at all to be the 4 of us in the apartment.

It is just like the description, but there was no wifi (not the first time given previous comments), which wasn't a real issue for us after all.
The mattress on the floor is good for one or 2 nights but not more if you have a sensitive back. The metro indeed takes you to the Center of Stockholm in somewhat 30 minutes : all in all, it took us 1 hour every morning from the moment we left the apartment to the moment we arrived where we wanted to be in the city (we had to use connections).

Overall, this place is a good quality-price ratio !"
4298,688947,74556156,2016-05-15,48943882,Andrew,"Unfortunately, we didn't get to meet Alexandre until the final day of our stay, but the place was exactly as described. There was a problem, though, as the Wi-Fi had been disconnected before we got there, but Alexandre did offer to let us use his phone for internet, and if our schedules had matched up I am sure he would have been more than accommodating in this respect. It was a pleasant trip and I would definitely go back there if I wanted to go back to the Stockholm area - it's so close to public transport and a supermarket, and the décor is great."
4299,688947,75756822,2016-05-22,59567688,Samantha,"Alexandre's place was very nice, it was close to the metro that took about 15mins to get to the city. We pretty much had the place to ourselves which was great to have our own privacy. Alexandre kept in contact with us regulary and was a great host even though he wasnt there. thank you very much for the stay! :) "

A few minutes walk to the T-station, and from there around 10-20 minutes to the center of town, depending on where you want to go. Communication with Alexandre was good and clear. He also let us use his parking place, which was very valuable to us! I would definitely recommend Alexandre as a host."

4310,688947,87658536,2016-07-21,8037441,Sarah,It was not so nice cuz we rent a home and accepted that the check in was already late and then he kept dilaing it then if the home is for sharing so it  must be changed on the site from( eget hus) own house cuz not everyone gonna have time to read all this introduction about it especially when it's so long and then 2 words about he is  gonna come shower and cook anytime or sleep in a tand in the yard

The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful and the house was fully equipped as mentioned in the description.  Unfortunately the wifi did not work while we stayed there but the host offered us to use his phone if we needed internet connection. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at Alexandre's house."
4312,688947,89555227,2016-07-29,44205425,Mario,"we enjoyed Alexandre's place. He was kind and helpful, special when we arrived to help us to describe his place to our friend, where we are.
He also played on his drums for me, immediately when I asked him. 
His place is clean and quite, a prefect place where you can begin you trip to Stockholm and around. Lot of ways to take a walk. All what you need is close to his apartment.

O anfitriao foi grosseiro e mau educado. Nao pudemos utilizar nada alem do quarto e banheiro. Nao voltarei nunca para esse lugar"

The house is in a calm neighbourhood and really close to the nearest train station, so in around 30 minutes you can travel to the old center and the more turistic spots.

Alexandre  had already warned us that wifi was not available at the moment, and he was kind enough to share his phone for internet when necessary."
4321,688947,103493768,2016-09-22,36498421,Olga,This is a very cozy and clean home located in quiet and green area with a little garden and amazing atmosphere. I think music and Old Gods live there :). But if you are looking for only comfort it's not place for you. If you want something more then stay there without hesitation and you get everything you need:).

Just few meters from T-bana (metro station). Close to big LIDL (grocery store). 20 min. by T-bana to city center. Building just accross bus stop of night bus to city center. So, location is GREAT! Strong Wi-Fi. HIGHLY recommended!!!"
4328,688947,184862939,2017-08-20,60318838,Gianluca,"We stayed at Alexandre's with two persons. He accepted our request spontaneously, we were very greatful for this because there was no other affordable accommodation available that day. Thanks again for that! :)
Alexandre was a very nice host and gave us some advice for sights in Stockholm. He gave us access to his whole flat, even his Playstation and instruments. 
Nevertheless the photos in this announcement are not up to date, since he moved. His new flat, which is situated in a very diverse neighbourhood, is not completely furnished yet and didn't feel homelike at first sight. 
All in all we are satisfied and very thankful for a roof over our head for two nights."

Alex was absolutely perfect in every way, very arranging, nice, perfect host I almost felt as good at at home, he is open minded and curious, you feel he is just a very nice person who wants to exchange ! He gave us all the details needed (also the address of this blues bar that I loved!), is an excellent cook and just wanted us to have a good stay, what we did! Don't change nothing Alex, and hopefully see you around !!"

It was very nice, clean and comfortable place where I could feel myself as at home which  I value so much. It is quiet place in central Stockholm for a reasonable price in spite Ilona has several pets. Ilona is very helpful, warm and friendly host and I would definitely recommend to choose this place to stay in central Stockholm and If I am at Stockholm again I would prefer to stay here again."
4334,700113,3134777,2012-12-22,4206877,Richard,"This is a lovely part of Stockholm, ideal for any holiday or business destination. Ilona is kind and pleasant to deal with. I can highly recommend this quiet city dwelling."

Studion ligger i ett bra läge en kort promenad från stadens centrum och nära massor av lokala butiker, kaféer och barer. Tack igen Ilona, hoppas du inte var alltför trött på loppmarknad!"
4336,700113,4799355,2013-05-27,3199132,Bob & Gina,Ilona is the perfect hostess.  Her little studio is the perfect place to stay in Stockholm.  Easy access to public transit to anywhere in the city.  She has equipped the studio with every convenience required. The spacious main room opens onto a tiny sundeck with table and chairs affording a wonderful view of the park across the street making it perfect for meals and relaxing.  We look forward to returning to this studio in the center of Stockholm.   G&B
4337,700113,5248269,2013-06-20,6490697,Wai Chun,"Ilona is a fantastic hostess, she is very friendly. My partner and I spent about a week at her place. The place is clean, lovely, and quiet. It has a good view to a lovely park just across the street. The building has good security too. Her pets won't disturb you if you stay in the studio. A big supermarket is just two blocks away, on a street full of coffee shops, restaurants, and other shops. Metro is just 10-min-walk  away, and with 10 more minutes you can arrive at the old town (Gamla Stan). I would recommend Ilona's studio to anyone who wants to visit Stockholm for more than just one or two days."
4338,700113,6335410,2013-08-08,7062075,Kristin & Dane,Nice apartment not far from the middle of Stockholm.  Clean enough and equipped well for two. Ilona was friendly and easy to communicate with and the key pick up was smooth.
4339,700113,6575760,2013-08-17,236843,Ryan,Great cozy and quiet studio apartment located close to everything in Stockholm. Llona is a great host and was very helpful. 
4340,700113,6823253,2013-08-26,484199,Lucy,"Illona's place is really lovely with a light and airy room, a balcony to soak up the sun with and a beautiful green space directly across the road to go for a walk in.  I would recommend staying here as it's within really easy access to the main shopping area and not far from the Old Town.  Hire a bike and enjoy!!   Illona's place also has a fridge and cooking facilities and is very private.  "
4341,700113,7424972,2013-09-19,2652025,Rui,"Illona's apartment is as described, ideal for 2 people, with a small kitchen corner. In the bedroom there is a table for sitting and eating, which is a bit cramped, though. The balcony is very pleasant, the sofá comfortable, the bed has a soft matress. Illona's animals don't disturb at all, but she does start receiving her pets early in the morning, which may disturb a bit, if you wish to sleep a bit more. The apartment's location is great, I would not walk to the central station with suitcases, but the subway is just 5 min away, and there are just 2 stops there. Overall everything went fine, and I would recommend this apartment for future guests. Just bare in mind that suggested prices are 1 guest based, and that a second person makes it a bit more expensive than the price which shows first on the system."
4342,700113,7528934,2013-09-23,5080273,Ella,"I had a fantastic stay at Ilona's studio! I was in Stockholm for a conference and the location was very convenient. I found it to be nice and quiet, but around the corner from a lively street full of restaurants, bars, supermarkets etc. I walked into the city numerous times (it's a fairly long walk, which I like, but there is also public transport nearby). The studio is completely self-contained and Ilona lives next door. The apartment was laid out a bit differently to the pictures but I found it to be very clean, comfortable and spacious, perfect for one but also good for two. I sat on the balcony to eat dinner when the weather allowed and it was lovely. Ilona was very friendly, helpful, quick to respond and easy to communicate with. The Arlanda airport bus stops about a 15 minute walk from the apartment. I wouldn't hesitate to stay again or recommend staying here!"

The place was as displayed in the description and perfect for our needs. Ilona is a warm and thoughtful host, well-organized, giving tips on what taxi companies not to use, respecting our privacy, all great. I can only recommend staying over here. The location is quiet, some shops (open until 23:00H) further down the street, some bars, ... Perfect!"
4352,700113,12888356,2014-05-13,13551150,Luana,"Esperienza molto positiva, Ilona è una persona molto disponibile e gentile, il bilocale è molto accogliente e caldo, ideale per rientrare dopo una giornata di passeggio in giro per le isole e il centro città. Comodo a tutto, negozi per la spesa a 100 metri, parco di fronte al terrazzino, vicino alla Metro e in 20 minuti di passeggiata in centro per shopping e altro. Da fare da soli o in coppia !! Ideale !!!"
4353,700113,13343872,2014-05-26,12747209,Erika,"Everything went very well.
We found the apartment quite quickly, it was arranged just as on the picture, very cosy and sufficient for our needs.
We had a breakfast and dinner at the balcony each evening.  Shops, bars, cafes, restaurants were all within the walking distance.
Really good location - close to the city centre, but further from the noise of the central bars...
There is only one negative - if you leave you balcony door open during the night you must be a very good sleeper - might get noisy from cars and motorbikes passing around - otherwise close the door and you sleep in peace and quiet.
Kitchen is quite small, not really sufficient for cooking, but just enough for making breakfast and salad dinner.

Ilona is a very nice host, can only recommend.

Overall satisfaction - great -  my first airbnb experience was a very good one.

Thank you!

4354,700113,13908432,2014-06-08,12544628,Daniel,"Anfitriã simpática. Vale a ressalva de ser uma suíte compartilhada dentro de seu apartamento, e não dois apartamentos separados como sugere o anúncio. As fotos lhe darão uma impressão de ser maior do que realmente é, mas é realmente confortável e bem equipado. 
A localização também permite que vc conheça tudo a pé, embora fique a duas quadras do metrô para distâncias maiores.
Pelo preço da estadia, vale a pena numa cidade cara para este fim."
4355,700113,14191945,2014-06-14,15260417,Peter,"Ilona was a very friendly host, kind and easy going, and her small appartment was perfect. I was on a research visit to KTH (the university of technology) wich was just a 15 min walk from there. A bit noisy during night since there is a road passing by just outside, but not to bad, and if you want to stay central this is very often the case. Ilonas dogs will not make any fuzz, at least I did not even notice them appart from when we met in the hallway :). Thus, highly recommended!"
4356,700113,14465582,2014-06-20,13400439,Katharina,"The studio of Ilona was exactly how described. We totally liked the 5 days we stayed at her place. We got a nice warm welcome from her. Everything was clean. The location of the apartment is perfect. Just a 5 minute walk to the subway-station t-bana and 2 stops to t-centalen in the city. A bus-stop is around the corner. A lot of supermarkets are in walking distance. As well as the coffeshops, restaurants and bars. We would definitely come back.
Thanks a lot. :)"

The apartment is very cozy and clean, and has everything you need for a short stay. 
I would totally recommend it. "
4358,700113,15416839,2014-07-08,15429666,Christopher,"The apartment was great! Ilona was available to help and answer questions, and the apartment is just as listed. You don't hear or notice the pets and have as much privacy as you wish. The window and balcony face a street so there may be some noise at night, but it also has a lovely view of a small park. I would stay here again and recommend it to anyone looking for a small cozy apartment to stay in."

4360,700113,16395997,2014-07-27,11695566,Dorothea,die Lage war gut für einen Schwedentrip und von der Größe hat's für zwei gut gepasst. Süße kleine Küche :) Die Gastgeberin war auch freundlich und wohnte direkt nebenan. Jedoch nicht zu empfehlen bei Katzenhaarallergie.. Ansonsten stimmt wohl das Preis/Leistungsverhältnis !
4361,700113,16713173,2014-08-01,12633744,Mirka,"I can highly recommend Ilonas appartement! 
It was cozy, clean and really close to the city center.
Ilona was a very nice host – you live pretty close to her but still have your own privacy.
The bed is a little small for two persons – so only sleep there together if you have a close relationship ;-)

Thanks a lot for your hospitality, Ilona!"
4362,700113,17670528,2014-08-16,11940293,Giorgio,"I've been here for 15 days, in august 2014.
The apartment is as you can see in the photos: quite small but nice and clean.  From the balcony you have a nice view of the park. 
The apartment is in the city center, near to the subway stations and food shops.
Ilona is very kind: she invited me to a party with neighbours and she also washed my clothes for me.
Solution ok for 1-2 persons for short stays.

Ilona is very kind, helpful, sympathetic and easy to talk. She does her best to make the guests comfortable. Her pets are nice and friendly.

We have no reason to complain : everything was perfect. Thank you very much Ilona !"
4365,700113,18718192,2014-08-31,15559170,Iris,"I stayed 5 nights at Ilona's appartment in Stockholm and it was very nice. Ilona provided me with al the information how to come to here place and gave me a very warm welcome. The appartment is perfect for a single person, or a couple (the bed is small but nice and soft) and contains everything you need. The appartment was very clean and cosy. The appartment is close to many bus and metro stops and a small but lovely park is very near. As you can expect in any large city, there is some noise during the night if you sleep with the windows open. It did not bother me but otherwise just bring a pair of earplugs and you will be fine.
Thank you Illona for the nice stay!"

I was greeted with a warm smile, a big hug, a very very clean pad, and even some light refreshments waiting for me in the fridge. I was definitely glad to have spent another few weeks with her as the place was immaculate, true to description, and easy to recommend to fellow coworkers and friends who would be traveling to Stockholm.

4372,700113,24108463,2014-12-20,23286118,Will,"I stayed in Ilona's studio apartment for a month, and was very pleased with my stay (and in fact I've arranged to stay there again). It's a small but cosy apartment and has everything I needed. The studio apartment adjoins Ilona's own apartment but is separate and private. The apartment is centrally located but quiet. There's a nice little balcony which overlooks the park opposite. Ilona is friendly and helpful. She even did some laundry for me."
4373,700113,25998224,2015-02-01,23286118,Will,"This was the second time I stayed in Ilona's Studio Apartment, and as before, I was very happy with my stay. It's a small but cozy apartment with a practical layout. The studio is centrally located but quiet, with a balcony that overlooks the park opposite. Ilona is a lovely host, friendly and helpful."
4374,700113,27457353,2015-03-05,22703330,Marij,"Prima accommodatie. Ik was hier voor een werkbezoek van een maand. Het was een rustige plek, ik heb er prima geslapen. Heerlijke douche en mooi uitzicht op het park. Ilona was erg aardig en altijd bereid ergens mee te helpen. Ik kan het iedereen aanraden."
4375,700113,28096164,2015-03-17,28503702,Alessandra,"Sehr nett und freundlich, hat Frühstück für den ersten Tag organisiert."
4376,700113,28351719,2015-03-22,29205583,Morgane,Notre séjour dans le studio d'Ilona s'est très bien passé! Elle a été très réactive à nos messages et questions dès le début et s'est toujours montrée disponible sur place également. L'appartement correspond tout à fait à la description et est situé dans une rue calme. Le quartier regorge de restaurants et est très bien desservi par les transports publics.
4377,700113,28603256,2015-03-27,17962689,Richard,Llona sent clear information before my trip and was very welcoming when I arrived. The apartment was very clean and tidy. The buses and t-bana are only a short walk away. I can recommend staying here.
4378,700113,29779564,2015-04-12,1874449,Karen,"It was wonderful staying at Ilona's studio. Everything was in working order, close to shops, and the grocery store. The neighborhood was safe and quiet. There were maps and useful information that she provided. "
4379,700113,33983349,2015-06-03,11455338,Christopher,"llona is a fantastic host. Extremely friendly and accommodating,  I stayed for 40 nights while I was staging at Restaurang Frantzén and she gave me new towels and even washed my clothes.  I would gladly stay again when I come back to Stockholm.  The studio was well worth the price."
4380,700113,35356417,2015-06-17,671733,John,A great experience all around. Ilona was super helpful and even did my laundry for me. Great location and value. 
4381,700113,37138824,2015-07-05,17335200,Diana,"Ilona is a very nice lady and an excellent host. Communication was perfect right from the start: the replies were fast and I received all the information I needed, concerning transport, shops opening hours, etc. She even bought the books I needed for my course, which I wouldn’t have been able to get in time and gave me a lift to City Terminalen on my way back. Fruit and nuts were awaiting me in the room, a very appreciated welcome!

The location is perfect: the studio faces a small park, great for taking a stroll or sitting and reading. An open-air swimming pool is also to be found in the park, just a few hundred meters from the apartment (for those summer days, yes it can get hot in Stockholm!). Walking on you’ll reach Haga Parken, a huge and wonderful park, fantastic for walking, jogging, cycling, taking a plunge in the “lake” or simply relaxing. Sport fans will also find many a gym very close to the apartment (Word Class, SATS, Friskis & Svettis, Pilates Studio, Crossfit). Folkuniversitet is a few blocks away, Techniska Högskola and Stockholm University within easy reach. The city center is 2-3 metro stops away or 20-30 minutes walking. Supermarkets and plenty of bars/restaurants are to be found in all the neighbouring streets.

The studio has everything you need and offers complete privacy. Ilona is there if there’s anything you need, though. She has a washing machine in her part of the apartment, not just in the basement, as many other apartment houses in Stockholm do, which gives greater freedom of use (no reservation lists, you just need to ask).

The only downside is a patchy internet. Alright if you just need it to check your email or the occasional social networking, a bit problematic if you rely on it for serious work or studying. The bed is a bit on the soft side.

All in all this is definitely an apartment I would recommend!"
4382,700113,37782934,2015-07-10,5261662,Philipp,"I had an excellent stay in Ilona's flat. It was clean, comfortable and quiet. It is perfectly located between the city centre in the south and the university in the north so I could do everything walking. No need for public transport. Also the connection from the airport via the Alranda Flygbus is good. The internet was indeed a bit weak, but Ilona said she had already ordered a new access point, so I am sure this will be sorted out in due course. Overall I had an excellent experience and would definitely stay again with Ilona!"
4383,700113,40078835,2015-07-28,29388964,Donna,Ilona made us feel very welcome.  She connected with us prior to our flight to enquire about how we were getting to her from the airport & then gave good directions to our studio.  She was welcoming when we arrived & helped us with questions. The Studio was well stocked & Ilona further welcomed us with a bottle of wine & a handmade leaving gift.
4384,700113,40402136,2015-07-30,12305527,Kunal,Ilona is a great host and her apartment is conveniently located. I would recommend her without any reservations!
4385,700113,41020634,2015-08-03,3104480,Anthony,"1st, Ilona was very reactive, it took less than 5 minutes to rent the studio !
Then she provided excellent practical information, very easy to find the appartment and she was there to welcome me. Ilona is very nice and  helpful and makes you feel at home. 

I had a perfect stay, the description fits the reality, clear & clean appartment. The view on the parc just across the street is nice and you can enjoy a drink on the terasse after a long day of walking through Stockholm !

The situation is great, I went to the center walking, which takes between 20 and 30 minutes through animated streets (shops...).

I highly recommend staying there !

4387,700113,43753617,2015-08-22,32006642,Rory,"We had a great stay with Ilona. She was very helpful and friendly, even lending us a transportation card during our stay. The place is really clean and cozy, and in a great neighborhood within walking distance of anything you need. If I ever go back to Stockholm, I'd definitely try to stay here again. No complaints at all. Thanks, Ilona!"
4388,700113,45930728,2015-09-07,20561126,Stevie,"The picture doesn't quite do the studio justice - if you stand the other way, you'd see the balcony where you can sit and have coffee overlooking the park, and Ilona goes out of her way to make the whole place feel very homey. Really a lovely place, one of the nicest Airbnb's I've stayed in, and great for long stays as you have a little kitchen to cook in, if you're so inclined. Otherwise, it's easy to walk just about anywhere, and the neighborhood is very safe, with lots of restaurants and cafes just a block or two away. Would happily come back any time. "
4389,700113,46631434,2015-09-12,5011070,Jan,"I had a great time at Ilona's, she was very welcoming and helpful. The apartment was clean and pleasant, well furnished with a nice balcony with flowers, close to a metro stop, shops and a park."
4390,700113,48190788,2015-09-24,41519736,Noam,"A nice apartment,fully equiped in one of the better neighberhoods of Stockholm.
There is a buss station right next to the apartment and a metro station ,5 minutes walk in odenplan and Stockholms center station at 25 minutes walk down the street.
It recommended wormley.

4391,700113,48556416,2015-09-27,30759599,Egle,"Very good communication with the host. Quick responses and clear directions. Nice flat in central area, few minutes from metro stop. Would recommend and come  back again!"
4392,700113,51727415,2015-10-24,43408919,Joshua,I had a very nice ~1-month visit to Stockholm and thoroughly appreciated staying in this small apartment. I would consider staying there again. It is within walking distance of the university and many restaurants. The host is also very nice.  
4393,700113,52507884,2015-10-30,32768061,Francisco,"I have booked the same apartment two times in two weeks (first five days and then three more days) because Ilona is a very helpful person, she is really nice and helps a lot if you need it. The apartment is ideal for one person who wants to be at the center of Stockholm. It has a very good connection with Tunnelbana and busses, also very clean and  full equipped kitchen. "
4394,700113,52897356,2015-11-02,15805160,Giæver,"Illona met us at her house when we arrived. Was planning to go to Stockholm alone, but after I made the reservation my mom decided to come along. Illona offered ut a spare bedroom for just a small extra cost. 

The studio apartment was convenient; The kitchen was big enough for making a small en easy breakfast to the two of us, but it wasn't well enough equipped so I would consider it more as a «tea-kitchen» - but no problem for us as we went out for dinner every day. The bathroom was reasonable sized and more important; very clean. The living room / sleeping area had a lot of space and it was very nice to be able to open the balcony door during the night, if it got very hot. Even though the studio is very centrally located, it's placed in a street next to one of the main streets (Sveavägen) and therefore very silent by night.

The bedroom was in Illonas own apartment, but that wasn't any problem. We were glad to have separate sleeping areas, and the bedroom was big and comfortable."
4395,700113,54616923,2015-11-22,47598074,Susi,"Very welcoming person, safe neighborhood, close to cafes and restaurant. Very clean and warm place"
4396,700113,56431974,2015-12-13,45465424,Alex,Ilona was a very gracious and accommodating host! She was kind enough to meet me at a late hour and the flat was just as described. Strongly recommend and would stay again!
4397,700113,56707214,2015-12-16,43798433,Alexander,"The studio is very centrally located, I actually only used a taxi to get there once - after that I always travelled on foot. It takes you half an hour to any central part of the city. The studio was clean and quiet and Ilona was a great host."
4398,700113,58782530,2016-01-05,42059000,Jonathan,"This is a private studio apartment with a balcony over-looking a park close to markets, stores, night-clubs and only a fifteen-minute walk to central Stockholm. Beautifully clean, a big bathroom, small, railroad kitchen but I cooked with no problems. Plenty of closet space.The double bed is comfortable. Ilona is a perfect hostess, ready to help but discrete and non-intrusive. A guest only shares an ante-room which leads to Ilona's place and the Airbnb apartment she offers. When I return to Stockholm, I wouldn't consider going anywhere else. Ilona told me she has many repeat visitors, some who come to 
Stockholm for work, many times. Five stars out of five."
4399,700113,60074023,2016-01-18,5098616,Natalie,I needed to make a last minute trip to Stockholm and Ilona helped me so much! She was very accommodating and it was great to have a space to myself. The heating felt great in very cold weather and the bed was comfy as well. I did not cook much but it is possible if you need to. She provides bags of tea and various kitchen products that make it easy for you. It was a secure building and convenient to get around with public transportation. Would recommend to a friend!
4400,700113,61371427,2016-02-03,23005658,Greg,"This is a very pleasant place for a base for exploring Stockholm.  It's quiet with a view to a park, but it's central and close to the center and shops, the university, and public transportation.  Ilona is a very nice host.  I always try to stay here when I go to Stockholm!"
4401,700113,61628283,2016-02-07,15599051,Donna,"Location was perfect, 5 minute walk from the subway station, and easy connections to all over the city. Also can get to most places by foot.  Room was clean and she kindly left fresh food for breakfast and nice fresh fruit. The room was very warm even with very cold temperatures outside. Wifi is very fast. "
4402,700113,62060635,2016-02-11,47902023,Christoph,"Very friendly reception. The fridge was already filled. Very quiet home. Nearby is everything you need: supermarket, restaurant, coffee etc. Located very centrally! I was three days there for an Budotraining and had an wonderful relaxation during breaks."
4403,700113,63140154,2016-02-20,3466784,Estelle,Thanks to Ilona for the nice welcome. The place is a little independent studio with a lovely view on park and church in a well located area. Simple and convenient for a short stay in Stockholm. 
4404,700113,66673699,2016-03-24,23005658,Greg,"Ilona is a great host, and this is a very nice and convenient place.  I usually stay here when I go to Stockholm."
4405,700113,68989397,2016-04-08,3908961,Nadav,Great nice and comfortable flat with a balcony and view over a park. Would certainly try to stay there again in my future trips to Stockholm
4406,700113,69258592,2016-04-10,8196202,Laure,Ilona a été très sympa et accueillante. Le quartier est calme et la vue donne sur un parc très calme. Il faut un peu marcher pour rejoindre le centre mais cela se fait.
4407,700113,70125513,2016-04-16,66279578,Christine,Had a lovely stay in Ilonas apartment. She is such a nice person. Would love to see her again. Maybe one day I will stay at her place again.
4408,700113,71006304,2016-04-22,21694260,Kristian,"Ilona er en veldig søt, behjelpelig og morsom dame som fikk meg til å føle meg veldig velkommen. Leiligheten var ren og ryddig, pent innredet og hadde alt jeg behøvde. Oppholdet var helt supert."
4409,700113,73256806,2016-05-07,10258283,Ivan,"We stayed at Ilona's for four days, and we had a truly wonderful experience. The apartment is in a quieter part of town, but still walking distance or a short metro ride on the green line to Drottninggatan, Gamla Stan or Södermalm.  Ilona is a welcoming and friendly host, and the place is nice, comfy and clean. Very much recommended. "
4410,700113,74549860,2016-05-15,4659482,Christopher,"Wonderful visit.  The host Ilona is helpful and very nice.  She made us feel welcome.  The apartment is in a great location with many nearby transportation options, supermarkets, restaurants, and a park right in front which the balcony overlooks.  Comfortable, clean, quiet, and well-equipped kitchen.  Highly recommend!"
4411,700113,74926665,2016-05-17,51966106,Hazel,Ilona is a lovely and friendly host. Her apartment is very cozy and we really like that there were maps and city guides stocked up inside. Will definitely stay again if given the chance to ! 
4412,700113,75025461,2016-05-18,11698655,Renee,"Ilona was very welcoming and helpful.  While bedding in the photo is different, the other aspects were accurate.  The wifi worked well.  "
4413,700113,75865804,2016-05-23,13506014,Sherry,Ilona is a gracious host and studio is just as pictured.  Location is excellent - quick access to public transport and everything I needed was in walking distance.  Kitchen has all essentials and there are three grocery stores nearby.  Wifi worked well.
4414,700113,76248877,2016-05-25,28244534,Jessica,"This studio was perfect for my short business trip to  Stockholm. It was located near public transport and local amenities (supermarkets, restaurants etc) and 20 minutes walk from the centre of Stockholm. 

The studio is simply decorated but had everything I needed. The balcony was a welcome extra space on a warm evening overlooking the park. The fact that the location is only 50 metres from an outdoor swimming pool was an added bonus, enabling an early morning swim before work! 

Ilona Margareta was friendly and welcoming on arrival. It was nice knowing she lived so close to the studio, but our paths didn't cross until I left 2 days later."
4415,700113,77709319,2016-06-03,19997488,Dunja,"Convenient location, everything that was needed was provided in the flat and Illona was very nice. Thank you!"
4416,700113,78782796,2016-06-09,22309550,Taryn,The studio was neat and tidy and clean. The location is about a 7 minute walk from the metro station in a quiet name and across from a park. It was peaceful and felt like home. 
4417,700113,79856408,2016-06-14,38979581,Richard,Great experience for my first AirBNB stay. Everything as expected. Thank you very much for the special arrangements due to my early arrival.
4418,700113,80137739,2016-06-16,4826411,Marianna,"This is a great flat for one in the centre of Stockholm, walking distance from the Public Library, shopping district and the central station. Great view from the window, well equipped, balcony (to have a glass of whatever during white nights), fast internet. The hostess was very welcoming and I felt much better and relaxed after my very busy days in Stockholm. I'd recommend the flat to solo travellers there for research trips (like myself) and just having a look around. "
4419,700113,81675570,2016-06-24,8983993,Michael,"The place was clean, centrally located and easy to access. "
4420,700113,82799311,2016-06-29,12628457,Grace,"Lovely balcony. Must enjoy your meal outside if the weather is good. 
Or take your food to the park across the street for a picnic. The supermarket is just few minutes away.
"
4421,700113,84164307,2016-07-05,4715303,M. Sean,I had a wonderful stay at Ilona's. The apartment was just as described and had everything I needed to enjoy Sweden. The place is very convenient and also private and after I first met Ilona I didn't see her again until the day that I left. I loved the balcony to enjoy the long Stockholm days.
4422,700113,85247657,2016-07-10,38593982,Michael,"Everything was as expected. The apartment is very clean, neat and private.  We liked the neighborhood and convenience to food, pubs and transportation.  Taxi direct from airport was US$61.00.  "
4423,700113,90246454,2016-07-31,17335200,Diana,"This was my second stay at Ilona's and I'm really glad I came back. Ilona is an excellent host: nice and kind, always available if you need something. The studio she rents out is a comfortable room with own bathroom and kitchenette, excellent for one person or a couple. Central location, a stone's throw from a big park, fantastic for joggers as well as for those enjoying a stroll or a swim. Swimming pool just opposite available as well. The room has a dedicated router, so the internet reception is perfect. The studio has been renovated as well since my last stay. 
If I'm in Stockholm again Ilona's apartment will be my first choice.
"
4424,700113,91201622,2016-08-04,22540692,Louis,"Ilona was a wonderful host! We arrived in Stockholm very early in the morning and she was extremely accommodating with meeting us early, storing our bags and helping us get into the apartment as soon as possible. The apartment is exactly as pictured, and is right near several bicycle rental stands for easy access into the fun parts of Stockholm while being directly across the street from a lovely park. I would certainly stay here again next time I'm in Stockholm- thanks Ilona!"
4425,700113,93403675,2016-08-12,4986697,Christian,I stayed at Ilona's place for one week. Ilona is a very warm and welcoming host and the apartment has all the amenities you'd wish for. The apartment is very clean and well located. I had a fantastic stay and would recommend to stay at Ilonas's to anyone visiting Stockholm.
4426,700113,94538938,2016-08-16,69032154,Andreas,"Ilona was the perfect host, forthcoming and welcoming from the beginning and made our stay most pleasant."
4427,700113,95865985,2016-08-21,37810595,Kenny,"This place was fantastic and Illona was a life saver. My flight was late and the airline lost my luggage so I was very late getting to the apartment. She stayed up and was very gracious when I got there. Also it took them two days to bring my luggage and it was my last night in Stockholm when they were going to deliver. They gave a 5 hour window for the delivery and Illona was there to collect while I was out enjoying the town. I highly recommend staying there, perfect for a solo traveller. "
4428,700113,96502682,2016-08-23,47856943,Åke,Ilona Margareta gjorde allt för att jag skulle få det bra. Hon är en mycket tillmötesgående och bra värd. Allt var jättebra.
4429,700113,96560136,2016-08-23,7107837,Ryan,The room and balcony were better than I had expected. llona was very kind and helpful with arrival and departure. The apt is very close to the subway system and overlooks a lovely little park. Well worth the costs! 
4430,700113,97677525,2016-08-28,69685796,Lisa,"Ilona's flat was a great place to stay. She was friendly and great with communications, and there were some welcoming nibbles laid out for me when I arrived. The flat is in a very central location, a short walk (maybe seven minutes or so) from the nearest metro station, and there are two supermarkets very nearby as well as loads of cafes, and a big park immediately across the street. The flat is small, but the space is organised very efficiently, so it didn't feel cramped. There is ample storage space in the wardrobe closet and the bathroom, plus a vacant drawer in the dresser and two drawers next to the bed. The bed and sofa are comfortable, and the balcony overlooking the park is absolutely lovely and gets full sunlight in the afternoon. The neighbourhood is rather noisy, so if you're a light sleeper you may want to bring ear plugs. There is a small kitchenette, but no pots, pans, or coffee maker (though there is a microwave and hot water kettle), so you'll only be able to cook in the microwave. Ilona lives in the conjoined flat (they're separate - they just share the entry foyer), so this is an ideal place for a quiet individual or couple. Ilona was a great host, and I'd definitely recommend her flat!"
4431,700113,98466672,2016-08-31,7704036,Koen,Ilona was super friendly and cooperative. I felt very welcome. The location of the apartment is superb. Good value for money in Stockholm!
4432,700113,101134447,2016-09-12,83654969,Amy,"The studio was absolutely perfect.  Ilona anticipates everything you could possibly need, and more.  She is generous, warm, welcoming… always willing to provide anything you could want.  The room was extremely clean, everything was comfortable and much nicer than I had expected.  I will certainly return on my next trip to Stockholm.  "
4433,700113,101794674,2016-09-15,63337684,Marie,A  very nice little studio. Clean and cozy. Ilona is a very nice and helpful host. Can be highly recommended.
4434,700113,102489519,2016-09-18,6146805,Monica,Ilona Margareta's place is amazing and in a great location! We were able to walk around the are and had easy access to other parts of the city. There are both buses and train stations in the area. Ilona is a very nice person and made us feel welcomed at home. She had the apartment stocked with all the supplies she thought we could need and asked us to let her know if we needed anything else. We could not thank her enough for her kindness and dedication. The apartment has a small kitchen so we were able to cook a few meals and enjoy them while sitting at the cozy balcony that comes with the apartment. I highly recommend her place to those who want to feel at home while traveling.
4435,700113,110031630,2016-10-23,23005658,Greg,"I had a very nice time at Ilona's place.  I like returning to it whenever I'm in Stockholm -- it's cozy, comfortable, and has a great atmosphere, with a very nice host."

4437,700113,112476488,2016-11-06,34014071,Yvonne,"This was my first solo airbnb and trip in general. I couldn't have chosen a better place. Ilona is an amazing host. She was very helpful and welcoming.  The studio itself is spacious and has cooking utensils, pots, and pans now! The place is also located within an 8 minute walk from a subway station. The neighborhood has quite a few restaurants and bars which is a plus. The grocery store is 5 minutes away. The day before my departure my luggage zipper gave out on me and the luggage store was closed due to the holiday. Thankfully Ilona had a spare. She's so kind! Also on the day of my departure it snowed and she offered to take me to the central train station. If and when I return I will definitely stay here again! "

The studio was clean and warm...especially appreciated in the cold Stockholm winter. Ilona was very nice and accommodated an earlier arrival than I expected. 
The location was great as the metro was only a few blocks away. If you are looking for a good place to eat in the area I recommend The Greasy Spoon for brunch and Jim & Jacob for dinner. Both were excellent and within a close walk."
4450,700113,136793573,2017-03-12,65277239,Enzo,Leona is a great host! She is very nice and warm. This place is everything you need and feels cozy.

4458,700113,156781736,2017-06-01,50958123,Jae-Yong,매우 청결하고 안락합니다. 어지간한 식기류와 조미료들 있어서 음식도 해 먹을 수 있습니다. 주변에 공원도 있어 산책하기도 좋고 시내까지도 걸어서 갈 수 있습니다. 아주 좋네요!!

The balcony is nice and overlooks a quiet park, great for having breakfast. The location is very convenient, as it's just about three blocks from the train, 2 blocks from a number of buses, and very close to a grocery store and many cafes and restaurants. I would definitely recommend staying here! "

4461,700113,160715491,2017-06-15,40709497,Shihabur Rahman,"It is very close to public transit (less than 10min walk to Odenplan metro station. 15min walk from nearest Flybussen station that goes to Arlanda Airport). Although the unit is located in a residential area, there are shops, restaurants, bakeries within walking distances. The unit was neat and clean and had a good workspace/Internet connection as well. It is definitely good value for money."
4462,700113,161613084,2017-06-18,27529523,Janny,Great place to stay when you are i Stockholm for business or pleasure. Very nice host too.

Ilona warmly welcomed me, even after having been much later than expected due to flight delays. You don't need to enter the house to enter the studio, so I would consider it as a very private place."
4464,700113,166383887,2017-07-03,41837634,Lisa Maria,My dad stayed at Ilona's place for a week and was very happy with everything. Ilona was very nice and the apartment is in a great location!

Ilona was also very accommodating where by terrible flight schedule was concerned (with flight delays and a late arrival). Would definitely consider staying here if I drop by Stockholm again.
4466,700113,172619558,2017-07-21,21871140,Serena,The studio was lovely and in good location. Ilona was very nice and helpful. I really recommend to stay at this place. It is the ideal starting point for discovering the best Stockholm has to offer.

4469,700113,176687446,2017-07-31,132277565,Beverley,"This studio has everything you need for basic catering and a very comfortable double sized bed. There is also a small divan and table and chairs. I loved having fresh air at night from the windows/ door leading onto the balcony. There is a little supermarket close by as well as a bakery and other restaurants and cafes. I was able to walk everywhere. My host looked after me in a couple of ways well above expectations. I will be back, especially as the price is so reasonable compared to a hotel. "
4470,700113,179661273,2017-08-08,30262095,Fabio,We spent 6 days at ilona's studio. ilona was a great host and she arranged everything Also for our One-year-old son Leonardo. It takes about o15/20 mins Walk to get to gamla stan but in any case the apartment is  close by to public transportation and the neighbourhood is full of very nice restaurants and grocery stores. Best thing: the apartment is located next to a very nice park.  The apartment is quite small  but we had most of dinners at home and never felt too tight. Would suggest the stay!

4477,700113,192805504,2017-09-11,33455153,Chad,"We really enjoyed our stay here. It is in a quiet area with a balcony looking out to the park across the street, which is nice. The apartment isn't in the center of most attractions, but it is within walking distance of many and access to public transportation is just fine, so that's not a problem. Check-in/check-out was easy, and the place was very clean for us. Would definitely stay here again."
4478,700113,193412640,2017-09-13,3154635,Jigar,Beautiful place. Very secure and organised. The host is cooperative and stayed in touch even with late evening checkin. Plenty of good restaurants at walkable distance. Recommended for sure.

There are many grocery stores around if you are interested in having a night in as well (the apartment comes with a mini kitchen). The host was super friendly, and quick to respond. She even called us a cab to the airport!"

4488,700113,219329799,2017-12-17,61487848,Jean Claude,studio conforme à la description. Hôte très discret. Point à évoquer ; le bruit provoqué à l'extérieur à proximité le vendredi soir du à des rassemblements de jeunes en voitures dotées de puissantes sonos diffusant de la musique jusqu'à 1h du matin : habitude locale
4489,700113,222200178,2017-12-29,83254262,Nadia,"Mrs llona has been very kind to me and my boyfriend and responded very quickly when we told her that we have a problem with our current accommodation in Stockholm and were searching for a new one asap. She has been very helpful and her studio was extra clean and cozy ! 
The location is very ok, just a 10 min (slow pace) walk to the nearest metro station."

Definitely recommended!"
4493,700113,228884135,2018-01-21,163705875,Anna,Very clean. Features a kitchenette and TV. This is the perfect set up in that you can be as separate from host Ilona as you wish or ask her for help with anything as she is literally in the flat next door.

4499,700113,241493022,2018-03-09,145938022,Shirley,I highly recommend staying at llona’s.  Very centrally located and in a very cool neighborhood.  It is an easy walk from two different metro station- no more than 10 minutes.  If you want to walk down to the water or to old town you can walk it in about 30 minutes. And very easy to get to and from the airport as you can take the city metro or the Arlanda express.  The flat is close to grocery stores and great restaurants.  We walked everywhere from the flat.   You can easily get to all of the sites from here. The studio is large enough for two people and is very quiet.  There are lots of nice touches -  even a lint brush and snacks!  We loved it and I would definitely stay here again.  There is also a lovely park across the street.  Overall it was a great place to stay.
4500,700113,242534154,2018-03-12,17335200,Diana,"This is my fourth time at Ilona's place and coming back is always a pleasure.

4502,700113,246353199,2018-03-25,10466805,Sara,"Ilona's place is quite nice. It's a lovely small studio with a conjoined main entrance with Ilona's apartment. The space is so well organised and beautifully lit. The kitchen has all the basics (salt, pepper, oil) and a lot more, which I really appreciated. Same for the bathroom. There's a few restaurants around and it's a 10 minute walk to the underground station. Central station is two stops away."

You can easily walk from the studio to explore the city, or take the subway, everything feels very near. The place is exactly what it looks like in the pictures. The kitchen is good for basic cooking. Ilona is a very kind host, always prepared to help out or give any information you might need. Thank you!"

4511,700113,262870010,2018-05-10,45905379,Marine,"Ilona a été très accueillante. Le quartier est quelque peu éloigné du centre et des quartiers touristiques mais c'est agréable de marcher dans un tel cadre. L'appartement donne sur un parc et est relativement calme. L'appartement est soigné, tout est mis en place pour que nous soyons bien accueillis. Super rapport qualité-prix."
4512,700113,265760431,2018-05-18,58458870,Merche, very positive
4513,700113,267587316,2018-05-22,96811296,Nuray,"We have stayed at Illona's place 3 nights with our 11 months old baby. The place was big enough for our little family. By the gorgeous view from the windows and balcony, the area is widened perfectly. The supermarket is 5-6 minutes away by walk and so the subway/bus stations. Ilona was very kind and thoughtful to provide us with the usefull baby equipments (baby crib with the cover set, feeding chair, bib etc.). Our trip was perfect with the help of this nice place."
4514,700113,268798382,2018-05-26,90344844,Camilo,The place was very clean and the balcón has a beautiful view of a park. Greatly enjoyed my stay in Ilona's place.

4516,700113,272311922,2018-06-03,28506717,Julien,"I came with a friend to take part in the Stockholm marathon and the location of Ilona's flat was perfect to go to the stadium. The balcony, exposed to the sun after 5pm in June, proved to be exceptional to rest and to enjoy a well-deserved recovery dinner. :)"
4517,700113,273205949,2018-06-05,76902269,혜정,IIona's place was perfect for everything and she was very   kind. Nice staying in Stockholm.
4518,700113,275488963,2018-06-11,18371020,Fazilla,"The apartment is cosy for two people and is conveniently located within walking distance to Odenplan station which is few stops away from major tourist attractions. 

There are also many supermarkets and amazing restaurants in the area (we recommend Burgers and Beer) for your convenience. Nice place for first timers in Sweden. "
4519,700113,278018517,2018-06-17,9625482,Aurea,"Very bad experience. 
The previous guests had left late and apartment may not have been cleaned properly (e.g. there was still perishable food in the fridge). The bathroom had a very strong unpleasant smell as did the fridge, and the overall apartment smelt like air freshener - she had an electric one by the flat entrance which she took away as soon as we settled in. 
The mattress was much too soft, which made nearly impossible to sleep (to the point that any time you turned you could hear every single spring). 
We had to leave the apartment after one night only even though we had three booked, as our young son would not settle (things improved drastically when we got to a hotel). 
When we tried to provide constructive feedback privately she got defensive and rather rude. The host refused to acknowledge any issues with the bathroom, said that the fridge smell was because of us (even though it was there when we arrived). 
Very disappointing, and made things extremely stressful for us as travelling with young baby"
4520,700113,280063703,2018-06-22,172016888,Karin,This is a great place to stay. I needed to go to the university ( Frescati) which can easily and quickly be reached from there by bus. Nice balcony... and room with view of park. Very friendly host.
4521,700113,284739544,2018-07-02,128930799,Michael,Ilona was a great host.  It's a perfect location for a small family.  The location was perfect in the city of Stockholm and to public transportation.   I reccomend her studio to anyone traveling to the city center.
4522,700113,286340441,2018-07-06,176103700,Tessa,"Ilona was extremely welcoming! She lives in the apartment next door and you share a common entrance way to lead into the two separate apartments, which I didn't realize. But she never bothered me or intruded in my own space. You have a key to your own apartment to lock it as well. The apartment had a bit of an interesting smell, but was super lovely! She had everything you could possibly need in the kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, etc. Super sweet and in a great area near a ton of restaurants and a great park. A bit of walking from downtown, but public transportation is easy. I loved this area!"

It's obvious that she invested a lot of work into the interiour of the flat and that she loves welcoming and taking care of guests. She even arranged some fruit and sweets on the table for us. Ilona is a very nice and warm host and we're looking forward to coming back!"

4529,700113,310022682,2018-08-19,192484039,Ela,"Lägenhet var som beskrivet, det var rent, låg centralt. Dock så blev det ett missförstånd när det kom till bokningen. Jag fick inte ha gäster över, trotts att det inte står, det var ursäkter med att folk tidigare har förstört eller fått grannarna att klaga. Vilket inte står med här, vilket betyder att värden endast gick utifrån sitt omdöme och fick för sig att jag ska göra en massa oljud eller liknande. Jag fick en utskällning framför mina vänner innan vi hann gå igenom dörren om att dem inte får komma in, och värden skrek nästan i panik trotts att det inte stod att man INTE får ha några gäster över. För mig var det tyvärr inte en bra upplevelse, det kändes jobbigt och skämmigt. Jag kände mig inte välkommen, och Illona hade bekräftat min bokning av misstag enligt henne. Jag checkade in, lämnade mina saker, gick ut igen. Kom tillbaka och bytte om och när gick ut så varnade hon att inte ta med någon för att hon är vaken och har koll. Sedan gick jag ut och var med mina vänner. Vid 03.00 så hämtade jag mina saker och sov hos mina vänner då jag tyckte att jag blev fel behandlad. Allt som annars står stämmer, det är rent och fint. Väldigt centralt, hon har en väldigt fin katt. Det saknades handdukar i badrummet när jag kom fram."
4530,700113,312818644,2018-08-24,16343809,Rosanna,"Sweet little apartment in the Vasastan neighbourhood with plenty of restaurants and supermarkets near by - we found it easy to walk everywhere else in the city (half hour to central) from here. Lovely to have a balcony for breakfasts/coffee (there's a good bakery round the corner!) It's a compact space but comfortable, well kept/equipped, and efficiently laid out. Ilona herself is very friendly, we would definitely recommend staying at her studio."
4531,700113,315218245,2018-08-28,14504500,Sabina,"Ilona place is great. Clean, spacious, nice energy and close to all the things you need (public transport, city center, markets, etc.). Highly recommended."
4532,700113,317359604,2018-09-02,13136533,Andre,Excellent location. Clean place. Nice view of park. Dog nextdoor did bark nonstop for a bit one afternoon but think that was an aberration. IIona was very friendly and kindly allowed me to store my bags there until my flight later on the day I checked out. Highly recommend this place for your base to explore Stockholm!
4533,700113,319787293,2018-09-07,98527894,Kristin,"A great place to stay in Stockholm!  Ilona is such a wonderful lady and her apartment was very clean, also in a good location with easy access to public transportation.  Ilona set up a crib and toddler equipment for our young daughter.  She also left a stuffed animal for our daughter which was so thoughtful!  Ilona was flexible with our check in/out and was easy to communicate with.  She even let us leave our bags when we checked out and we came back to get them before our flight.  Highly recommend!"
4534,700113,320599471,2018-09-09,108343764,Linda,"Ilona is a very warm and friendly person. The apartment is located next to her flat, so check-in was very easy and regarding timing also flexible. The apartment itself was very clean and cosy - and the balcony is just amazing :) The perfect place to spend some days in Stockholm. Although not located directly in the city center, it’s situated ideal - public library is 5min walking distance away as well as many sweet little cafes and others. Highly recommended :)"

Overall the place was clean (best for one person) and Ilona was a great host."
4540,700113,331299479,2018-10-02,188249175,Hilary,Just as described - Right off sveavägen so easy for north part of Stockholm.

4612,700113,518108477,2019-08-26,42131659,Barnaby,"It was a lovely place to stay, clean and good facilities. Good communication before arrival too."
4613,700113,521583544,2019-09-01,46384256,Hannah,The location of the apartment is perfect for exploring Stockholm. Our stay was comfortable and we were made to feel very welcome. Thank you!
4614,700113,523217848,2019-09-03,245613856,Steffen,"Zentrales, schönes Appartement mit netten Details und einer netten Gastgeberin."
4615,700113,524141029,2019-09-05,247128332,정순,It was greater than i thought.
4616,700113,527503800,2019-09-11,959323,David,Ilona is an amazing host.  The place is super clean and very well supplied.  Just a ten minute walk to Odenplan Station to get the commuter train to Arlanda Airport.
4617,700113,530067584,2019-09-15,159349790,Patricia,"We stayed two nights in Ilona’s Appartement.
The location is really good and central - if you like walking you can reach everything by foot. Also the airport shuttle bus is closed by.
However the interior of the apartment seems to be quite old and it is also quite small. The pictures seem to be taken at another point of time."
4618,708979,3052863,2012-12-09,900875,Robert,"Sam could not have been more helpful! He met me at the station, showed me the apartment, which was even better than described, and kept in contact throughout my stay to make sure I was ok and everything was fine. I can't recommend Sam's place enough. Full of beautiful mid-century furniture in a secure building close to the train line and central Stockholm. DON'T HESITATE TO BOOK WITH SAM! He's great, and so is his place."
4619,708979,68179248,2016-04-02,48768735,Simone,"We liked this flat a lot, it is very nice and comfy. The metro station is very close and you get fast and easy to the city center. The communication was very friendly and we enjoyed our stay. Very recommendable place and host! Thanks a lot! "
4620,708979,89849121,2016-07-30,67438276,Brian,"We stayed in Samuel’s apartment for two weeks. He was very accommodating and did everything possible to assist us during our stay. His apartment is simple and essential but comfortable, well positioned, bright and has a good sized balcony where you can eat, sunbathe or just “sit outside”. The neighbourhood is safe and friendly and is ideal for anyone wanting to stay in a quiet, “green” place away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre but just 20 minutes from it - the metro train station is just a few minutes walk from the apartment. Close by there is a great supermarket as well as a big park. We will certainly return."
4621,708979,174219850,2017-07-25,58287987,Sonja,"We really enjoyed our time in this apartment. It is comfortable, quiet and has a communal playground which my girls loved. It is very family-friendly and my girls really appreciated having their own bedroom with lots of toys. We found the neighbours to be friendly which also made us feel welcome. The location is great - close to a lovely nature reserve, a COOP supermarket and also very close to the metro (its only a short metro trip into the city centre). 

Samuel is a wonderful host. Great communication and very friendly. He met us at the apartment for check-in and provided lots of useful information. He was very willing to answer any questions and was very helpful when we needed advice about finding a Doctor for our daughter. He also left some breakfast supplies which was greatly appreciated after a long day of travel. We definitely recommend this Airbnb."
4622,708979,177046611,2017-08-01,139137073,Sabine,Samuels appartment is very cosy and clean and conveniently close to the city centre. He is a friendly man who tried to answer to all our questions. We had a really good holiday there!
4623,708979,188053733,2017-08-28,137324614,Constantin,"Schöne Unterkunft mit bester Anbindung per U-Bahn ins Zentrum. Nette Kommunikation und ganz wichtig: eine Wohnung, die tatsächlich bewohnt wird und nur temporär vermietet wird, also nicht - nach meinem Eindruck- als Touristenapartment zweckentfremdet wird.
Nice accommodation with best connection by subway to the center. Nice communication and very important: an apartment, which is actually inhabited and only temporarily rented, so is not - according to my impression - as a tourist apartment is misused."
4624,708979,298327212,2018-07-29,29517852,Félix,"Zona tranquila muy cerca de la estación del metro, a pocas paradas del cento, apartamento cómodo y amplio y anfitriones muy amables."
4625,723539,2812292,2012-11-05,749867,Jamil,"Mathias is a great host. Everything was arranged perfectly for our stay. He was even thoughtful enough to leave a guitar for me after reading in my profile that I am a musician!

His home is very nice and cosy. Its location makes it a perfect base for exploring Stockholm and it's a nice and warm place to come back to after a long day out in the chilly weather. 
The only minus is that there is no real access to the Internet at the appartement but that does not prevented us from enjoying our stay.

I would strongly recommend Mathias and his appartement if you're considering spending a few days in Stockholm!"
4626,723539,2940558,2012-11-22,3797529,Dario,"Mathias is selective about his guests, and I would be if I had his apartment. It is a cozy not-so-small penthouse at the very heart of Stockholm, balcony included. It is a warm place, and I felt like at home from the very beginning. Mathias was very thorough in his welcome package, and provided options to adapt to my check-in and check-out circumstances.
Highly recommend staying at his place.
Dario"
4627,723539,3989793,2013-04-01,5537558,Ilham,"I went to Stockholm with 2 friends, none of us knew anything about the city, so we wanted to find a flat in the center, and that's how we ended renting Mathias' flat. 
I have to say, the flat looks exactly like in the picture : very cozy, bright, beautiful flat. It is super well located, right in the city center, where all the bars and clubs are. We didn't even have to take the metro or a cab during our stay. It is also not far from the old city, which is very pleasant to visit during the day.
Mathias was very helpful, he sent us all kind of details and information before we arrived, and was available for all the questions we had. He took us for dinner in an amazing restaurant and gave us tips about how to explore the city.
I definitely would recommand him as a host. "
4628,723539,4037883,2013-04-04,5578979,Bella,"We had a great stay in Mathias' gorgeous flat in the heart of Stockholm. There was a super nice flow in the appartement and it really worked well for our little family. The kitchen got tested! And it could match my demands for every meal! This was the most important part for us, but we also enjoyed all the other bonuses as of the central location, not having to even move our car nor use public transport and still our days were filled with marvels! We found the inside market ""Östermalms Saluhall"" and the nearby health food stores which made us very happy. One afternoon was spent in the old town ""Gamla Stan"" and another at ""Djurgården"" and ""Junibacken"". Other super bonuses were the bathtub, the tidiness and the big balcony. The rest you can find out if you get a chance to rent Mathias' zen haven. He's a great host and we communicated easily from the start, check in- and out- times were customized to our needs and his possibilities, which is very generous! It felt so great to have a private home away from home while traveling and this is the best way I've been to Stockholm ever!  Thank you Mathias' and Airbnb"
4629,723539,4307763,2013-04-26,189962,Joshua,"Great place, great location, close to everything downtown! The place was good for 3 people (two in a bed + one on an extra mattress on the floor). We didn't spend too much time there but the kitchen was great and the bathroom clean. Would definitely stay again!"
4630,723539,4476485,2013-05-07,4212091,Sarah,"Mathias was a great host (even though we actually never got to meet!). He made sure all our needs were met. The apartment was lovely, clean and to a very high standard. The location was perfect and would be happy to stay here again. He happily provided an extra mattress for an impromptu guest - so very accommodating!  "
4631,723539,4587320,2013-05-13,1840967,Andhini,"Mathias apartement is all what the advert said it was. Central location with walking distance to most of the interesting location in Sthlm, super clean and comfy. He's resourceful and gives us few useful tips about Sthlm which quite helpful. I would recommend a short stay at his place."
4632,723539,4730267,2013-05-22,964923,Maxim,"We really enjoyed our stay at Mathias fantastic appartment. First of all it's wonderfully suited in the most fashionable and beautiful part of  of city, called Ostermalm. Even though it's  a rather expensive disctrict, it's still a great place to live, because you can  get to almost every nice and attractive for tourists spot by feet within 30 min. max. The appartment itself  is exactly as it is shown on the pictures. Very clean, nice and cozy. There are fiew nice cafees, and a 24 hour food stores within  2 minutes walk. The only thing that didn't really work was the wifi connection, so you betrer get ready to look for free spots around the city or in the nearby  cafees and restaurants. To say the truth - there are a lot of them all around the city. Mathis is a nice person,  and a great host. I do fully recomment this appartment, it's if definitely worth it's cost."
4633,723539,4861252,2013-05-29,2012723,Dan,"Two of us stayed in Mathias's excellent apartment and it was a great base to explore the beautiful city.  Everything you could want is there (although wifi a bit temperamental - try sitting by the window).  Mathias was very accommodating, we were late to arrive (thanks Heathrow!) and then had a later flight, so were able to leave luggage to pick up later.  Communication with Mathias was first rate, he made us feel welcome and gave good insight into what to make the most of while in the city."
4634,723539,5380487,2013-06-27,2940258,Alan,Mathias is a great host. His apartment is wonderful and in a great location with easy access to anything that you would need.
4635,723539,5907445,2013-07-22,2940258,Alan,Mathias' apartment was a perfect place for me to stay and work while I was in Stockholm. Great apartment and in a superb location!
4636,723539,6363366,2013-08-10,2166409,Eva,"I spent 12 days on Mathias Apartment in August with my partner and child. Stockholm is a wonderful place to visit and we enjoyed a lot our stay in the city. The apartment is perfectly located and you can just walk everywhere in the city. We only had to take a bus one day because it was raining a lot! 
Mathias was very gentile and provided a travel baby cot for our child. 
Generally speaking, the apartment was correct when we entered, but when you have a baby everything needs to be just perfect so we had to spend some time cleaning some parts of the house just after our arrival and we found some perishable food in the fridge that we had to get rid of.  The kitchen was tiny but we managed to prepare everyday meals on it. 
There was no space in any closet to put our clothes and it was not comfortable for us to have all our stuff and the baby’s distributed over the furniture.
We did our best to leave the house perfectly clean as we leave even if we didn’t found any brush and the vacuum machine didn’t work very well. The linen and towels provided were ok for a shorter stay. In our case, we had to wash them because there was no replacement. 
I do recommend this apartment but may be for shorter stays.
"
4637,723539,6623647,2013-08-19,1187337,Jon,"We really enjoyed our stay and Mathias was a great host.  The apartment was attractive, comfortable and clean.  The location can't be beat!  "
4638,723539,7052808,2013-09-04,3071810,Brendan,"Mathias was very kind and helpful, after some tips from him and his illustrations on a map, I was off to see Stockholm. I had never been to Sweden before, so he made sure that I had/knew everything that needed to make it a great stay.

The apartment was very clean, plenty of space and in a great neighborhood. There's a metro station very close by, and Stureplan and Östermalm are right out your door to eat and drink, as are the ferries that can bring you on tours of the archipelago. Couldn't believe how well located this apartment was. 

When I return, I will certainly stay here if it's available! Thanks Mathias! "
4639,723539,7233444,2013-09-11,3137114,Kim,The reservation was canceled 20 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4640,723539,7593314,2013-09-25,8850717,Sarah,"We had a great stay at Mathias' apartment. It is very nice, especially because being on the top floor gives it good light and it has a balcony. Mathias is very organized and everything went smoothly. (Note: there is no internet/wifi...) The location is pretty great, very close to many things."
4641,723539,7723280,2013-09-30,1445064,Nicholas,"beautiful apartment, excellent location in heart of stockholm, very clean, great access to public transport, nice balcony, and the host is very helpful. thank you!"
4642,723539,11173311,2014-03-24,11346408,Patrick,"Mathias was a great host and although I did not meet him in person he was very responsive to my messages. The flat was in a great location in walking distance from popular hot spots as well as the trains and buses. The place itself was very clean and presentable, spacious living room and comfortable bedroom. I only wished there were more towels and pillows. Aside from that the place is a definite recommendation for anyone's stay in Stockholm. "
4643,723539,13734757,2014-06-03,4268571,Merja,"Mathias was at the apartment when I arrived with my mother and her friend. The flat is at a great location, and easy access everywhere. There is no wifi but a cable connection. There were three of us (adults) staying in the apartment, whereas he only had two single blankets and blanket covers. When asked about it the next day and whether extra one could be arranged, we got quite a rude response saying that there aren't any extras, and no one has ever requested for extra duvets, and he has had plenty of guests. As a result, one of us slept under a towel under (we switched each night), two others using the (single!) duvets. 

Otherwise is very nice and clean, but I would not stay there again. This is the first time I've never had even a slightly negative experience renting a flat through Airbnb."
4644,723539,14388015,2014-06-18,12903134,Jan,"We had a very good time in the appartement and everything went very smoothly with Mathias. Mathias was even so kind to organize some extra stuff for our baby. The appartement is well equipped and located very centrally. You can reach many sightseeings by feet and the area around the appartement is vivid and beautiful. There are many stylish shops, bars, restaurants, etc. around. We can recommend to stay in the appartment!"
4645,723539,15110524,2014-07-02,611534,Kate,This apartment is wonderful! Best location in Stockholm!
4646,723539,16546636,2014-07-29,12943761,Kathrin,"Wir hatten eine wunderschöne Ferienwoche in Stockholm. Die Wohnung ist perfekt gelegen und war sehr sauber. Die Abmachungen mit Mathias haben alle geklappt. Da wir 4 Personen sind, war der Platz ziemlich knapp und auch die Schlafsituation mit den Decken war etwas dürftig (2 Duvets). Jedoch spielte dies aufgrund des schönen Wetters keine grosse Rolle. Wir empfehlen diese Wohnung für 2-3 Personen, aber nicht für 4. 
Liebe Grüsse
Katharina & Familie"
4647,723539,19073793,2014-09-06,7849515,Brigitte,"Excellent description how to come to the  apartment (from airport or railway station), everything was organized in a perfect way, the apartment was clean, bright, and very tastefully furnished, with a smart kitchen and a really wonderful balcony. 
mathias   is a very nice and uncomplicated host, offers help,if you need some, it was a pleasure for me to stay there for a whole week, and a pleasure as well to water all the plants.

the apartment is located in östermalm, a few minutes from humlegârden, a beautiful and peaceful place to make a break. therefore also the apartment is very quiet, perfect for a deep sleep after working or exciting city life.
there are many good bars and restaurants around the corner.
I absolutely recommend this apartment, perfect for one or two persons. "
4648,723539,23321223,2014-11-29,4237447,Jason,"Mathias came through on everything that he had specified in the description; clean, comfortable and accommodating apartment. A very seamless check in and the same for the exit. Warm when its cold out, quiet neighbors and it sits on a lovely street. While the weather didn't serve us any favors in terms of the balcony, I can imagine during the summer months you could be on the balcony all day. You are within striking distance to all Ostermalm and central Stockholm have to offer and only a few 100 yds from the Ostermalmstorg metro stop. Brasserie Godot on the corner serves a perfect Old Fashioned for cocktail enthusiast and while a bit pricey serves one of the finest pieces of steak I have had in Stockholm. Overall a great stay and a great location. Thanks for the pad Mathias, Cheers. "
4649,723539,25021797,2015-01-05,12534902,Hans,The apt is indeed very calm and charmy and we felt all the time very comfortable. Although we didn´t meet Mathias in person communication was allways friendly and correct. Thank you Mathias.
4650,723539,29412008,2015-04-07,538817,Danny,Very nice and clean apt in a super central location. Saluhallen and Sture Gallerian right around the corner and only a 5 min walk to the waterfront. Communication and organization worked perfectly. Thank you Mathias for the good accomodation. 
4651,723539,30563053,2015-04-24,4500015,Nina,This apartment is in the best location in Stockholm. Beautiful balcony. Typical Stockholm apartment--not huge but sufficient. Very clean. Host was friendly. Overall a very good 4-day stay. Note: there is no TV or phone in this apartment. Only one pillow on the double bed. Only one set of towels out but I was one person. No coffee maker. Note the 10:00 am checkout.  
4652,723539,31040529,2015-05-01,3819882,Julie,"Mathias' apartment is in an excellent neighborhood in Stockholm. It is a nice mix of residential and commercial within easy walking distance of major sights.  The apartment is as pictured in the photos online; it is cozy and comfortable, and it is very quiet at night.  Mathias provided us with some helpful literature about places to visit in Stockholm as well as recommended a local yoga studio and restaurants.  We thought is was an excellent place to say in Stockholm.

4653,723539,33774925,2015-06-01,27276046,María Jesús,"La casa estaba bien, la ubicación en un lugar tranquilo. El anfitrión bien, hasta el último día, que comunicándonos con el, entendimos que podíamos hacer el check out a las 11:00 (hablando con el a las 21:25, se lo comentamos, cdo nos pregunto la hora que íbamos a irnos. No nos respondió hasta las 8 am del día siguiente diciendo que 10:30, que no pudimos leer pk en la casa no hay wifi). Se presentó a las 10:15 en la casa, enfadadisimo,cuando fue un error de comunicación. Además, al final nos fuimos 10:30, nos lo encontramos en la calle y nos volvió a repetit que si no nos habíamos enterado de la hora del check out. Conclusión anfitrion desagradable por un error en la comunicación. La casa bien aunque falta tener wifi, mas si te comunica cn el anfitrión por whatsup"
4654,723539,35449780,2015-06-19,22487261,Rosemary,"We very much enjoyed our visit to Stockholm and we believe that the location of Mr Nordstöm's apt was one of the best in all of central Stockholm.  The neighborhood was quiet and we felt absolutely safe. It was very convenient to be able to walk from the Metro when we arrived as well as grocery stores, food hall (wonderful selection of seafoods that we prepared in the apartment), harbor, restaurants, museums and various other attractions.  Finding the apartment was easy and the key was available when we arrived.  There was plenty of space and the outside balcony was an excellent bonus."
4655,723539,36135589,2015-06-25,15906849,Qianlin,"Mathias is very helpful and he has provided very detailed information to help us on arrival. He also left is plenty of tour information. The apartment is in a very good location, very easy for us to walk to all attractions. It's also close to the pier so that we can do archipelago tour. It's in a posh area, there are plenty of fancy restaurants and designer shops to check out. Highly recommended for people who want to experience the Stockholm local life."
4656,723539,39127895,2015-07-20,7289006,Joel,"Listing accurate and a great location! I would definitely stay here again - it was great that it had a balcony too. 

Recommended!"
4657,723539,40769803,2015-08-02,17721290,Sonja,"Mathias is a very friendly and helpful host and provided very detailed informations. The apt is calm, comfortable and clean, corresponding to the description, quiet neighborhood and easy to walk to all attractions, public transport,.... It is  perfect  for one or two persons, but to sleep at the couch is not advisable for sensitive ears (aircondition).
Nevertheless I can highly recommend to stay there , it is a good place to relax after exploring Stockholm, thank you Mathias !
"
4658,723539,43966124,2015-08-23,28585892,Courtney,The listing was exactly as described. Mathias keeps a very clean and neat apartment and was very responsive when asked questions about the local life and culture as well. The apartment itself is quite spacious and was more than enough room for me and my 2 friends who stayed there. Thanks very much for the memories!
4659,723539,44909278,2015-08-30,15101008,Marta,"We loved our stay at Mathias apartment, the apartment is even better than it shows in the pictures, it's cosy and has a welcoming atmosphere. Mathias was waiting for us and left us a lot of useful sugestions about things to do in Stockholm. The apartment is very well located, in a quiet residential neighbourhood, but only five minutes away from a central and elegant area of the city. We recommend it. "
4660,723539,47308754,2015-09-17,27993828,Aurélie,"The apartment is very well located, just few steps away from Stureplan - in the surrounding area there are a lot of restaurant and shops.

The flat was very clean and comfortable. I arrived late in the night but the landlord has been quite flexible and he found a way to get me the keys.

There is a nice balcony, but weather doesn’t always allow to use it…

Definitely a great alternative to the hotel of the area, which are very expensive.
"
4661,723539,47752553,2015-09-21,41185069,Sam,"Great location. Super close to metro and walking distance to anything you need.
Great communication throughout entire stay. 
Amazing apartment, clean, comfortable and great sound system.
No wifi unless using a computer but was no issue for us as everything easy to find anyways.

Fully recommend this as a place to stay to see Stockholm properly. 
"
4662,723539,50370892,2015-10-11,44108074,Vanessa,"I stayed at Mathias' with two close friends. As this was the first time using AirBnB I was pretty nervous but it turned out great. Definitely priceworthy. 

The apartment is cozier and more personalized than I feel the pictures and description convey. The cleaning rules might seem rigid, but read once more they are really common sense. I guess Mathias, despite this, has had some negative experienced regarding checking out, hence the rules. 

If you are more than two people you must be okay with sharing beds as there are only one bed and one couch (that you can fold out into a bed). The kitchen is small but felt well planned and well equipped. We never cooked food but found everything we needed for making breakfast and snacks. It might be good to know that you are allowed to use essentials such as tea, coffee, butter, beans etc. If you are unsure just ask Mathias. 

He was reachable by phone and mail the whole stay. Unfortunately we never got the chance to meet but both check in and check out ran smoothly. The day of our arrival he called which was a much appreciated gesture. 

For us the location was perfect: central and quiet with beautiful buildings surrounding us. As an apartment at Östermalm is ridiculously expensive we felt lucky to get to live there, if only for a few days, and felt immediately at home. 

To sum it up: we were all three very happy with our stay and would love staying there again at future visits to Stockholm. "
4663,723539,53843538,2015-11-13,2331566,David,"Mathis apartment is cozy and in a perfect location - close to Stureplan but still on a quiet street. Everything was as expected, the practical details where sorted without hassle. The apartment is a little cold and there is some minor tumbling noise from the roof, but other than that it was perfect for my needs."
4664,723539,56613318,2015-12-15,29549693,Carl,"Exceptional stay and everything as advertised by Mathias in his detailed description and instructions. Apartment was immaculate and well-provisioned. Bathtubs are unusual in Swedish apartments. We needed this to care for a baby during our stay (one of the reasons we chose this specific apartment) and this was a life-saver. Washer and ""drying room"" in the basement also easy and convenient to use once we understood the reservation system. Mostly unused, easy to sign-up. A thoughtful neighbor even came to warn us when he was going to over-run his reserved time! Apartment location was exceptional, we could never afford to live full-time in such a hip, convenient, quiet, mixed resi-shopping-restaurants neighborhood, certainly not in a prosperous city such as Stockholm! Close to subway, bus and ferries. Great supermarkets and a ""Food Hall"" that is a tourist destination in itself. Although we only met Mathias in person once, he had prepared for our stay and the instructions were very thorough. When he needed access to pick-up something, he was very sensitive to our privacy and arranged well in advance. The plants seemed to weather my lack of a green-thumb (our stay was unusually long, about ten days) and provided nice ambiance. The USB Internet worked well once I was able to get a laptop working. I hacked my laptop to make it into a WiFi-repeater to extend The USB Internet so I could use with Smart Phones to avoid the expensive cell company data roaming charges, left Mathias with ideas if he wants to make a more permanent solution for those without USB ports. The kitchen was small but nicely designed and outfitted. A pressure cooker was a bonus and let us quickly prepare fresh organic vegetables from the market. The vacuum cleaner worked well once I learned how to adjust it for the various surfaces. Check-in/check-out went smoothly although the taxi driver from the airport first took us to the wrong address and so the entry keypad code didn't work...his mistake and corrected when he came back to get us! I hesitate to recommend Mathias' apartment only for selfish reasons...I hope to stay there in the future again and wish it to be open!! Seriously, if staying in Stockholm regardless of the season, you can't find a better place for a couple, even with a baby in tow! Didn't try the couch/guest bed, this might even allow for more people."
4665,723539,56975496,2015-12-20,50582633,Stein,"Had a great stay at Mathias' apartment. Mathias was a really nice host, flexible with checking in and out, explained everything we needed to know. The apartment itself has everything you might need. Good beds, good bathroom and even bettet kitchen. 
The USB for internet works pretty good but wifi would make this airbnb even better. Not really a problem though since there's plenty free wifi almost everywhere in Stockholm. If you're going to use the couch as second bed be wary that you can't really blind the window in the livingroom.
Overall Mathias' place is great for a weekend or a week in Stockholm. Almost everything you might wanna visit is in walking distance. Mathias is a nice and flexible host and his apartment was great.

4666,723539,58239038,2016-01-01,13336128,Francisca,"The apartment is great, location is perfect and Mathias is a great host! "
4667,723539,58606962,2016-01-03,4258077,Sophie & Jim,"We had a great few days at Mathias' apartment, great location in Ostermalm close to the centre of town. Although we didn't meet him personally, Mathias communicated everything to us perfectly well about getting the keys. The apartment itself was really nice, great size and great cooking facilities. Would definitely recommend staying here"
4668,723539,72349648,2016-05-02,15853281,Sergey,We have stayed at Matias's apartment this May. Perfect location - walking distance from city center on a quite street. Very close to underground station. Food store and food market nearby. The apartment is very clean and comfortable. The kitchen is well equipped. Mathias had provided us with all necessary things and gave detailed instruction regarding everything. We were fully satisfied with our stay there!
4669,723539,74434428,2016-05-15,5727230,Robert,"Mathias was quick to respond after our arrival at Arlanda. Though he wasn't able to greet us with the keys, he left straightforward instructions for finding them. The apartment is comfortable, and the photos in the listing are accurate. The balcony would especially be enjoyable in the summertime. The place is a short walk to the metro, and there are also interesting bars and restaurants in the area. We especially enjoyed being near the Ostermalm Saluhall. If you don't need wifi, this is overall a good place to stay."
4670,723539,75268055,2016-05-20,22155168,Merlin,Thanks for an enjoyable stay. The apartment is clean and looks as good as in the photos. It also seems to be in a pretty high-class neighbourhood. It is a short walk to the very appetising Saluhall market. Central station and Gamla Stan are also within walking distance.
4671,723539,76811731,2016-05-29,66747732,Christoffer,"Mathias var mycket enkel att ha att göra med, vänlig och tydlig kring detaljerna för vistelsen. Lägenhet var mycket fin och praktisk - med en fantastisk balkong. Skulle inte ha något emot att äga denna lägenhet själv. Toppenbra läge dessutom, lugnt område men mycket nära till restauranger, barer och naturstråk. Tack Mathias för en trevlig vistelse! "
4672,723539,79329963,2016-06-12,2436899,David,"Wonderful apartment. Neat, clean and easy acces. Central area with great restaurants and park in walking distance. Mathias was really helpful and made sure everything was right. Had a great stay. Balcony was just right for those sunny afternoons. "

4675,723539,82552484,2016-06-28,11767427,Gilles,"Mathias flat was lovely... In the heart of the city as everything is more or less walking distance. There are loads of restaurants, bars, and coffee around. The flat is the same we can see on the pictures. The terrace is lovely and Mathias communicated really well. All the instructions were clear.
I strongly recommend Mathias and his flat."

The apartment is quite large by Stockholm standards, with a lovely and balcony.  It's in the posh part of town, near all the nightlife, yet totally noise free.

If available, I look forward to staying there again next summer!"
4681,723539,99406121,2016-09-04,48078653,Sean,"Mathias was an excellent and caring host: he accommodated me arriving earlier than I had planned, and was gracious through our whole stay.  He communicated through this website often enough to stay in touch, and everything went well."

The city center as well as a nice park are withing walking distance. Mathias also offered us complimentary tea and coffee and provided us with the all information regarding sightseeing, groceries, pharmacy etc. Warmly recommended!"

4688,723539,128726067,2017-01-27,101551350,Jeremy,"Mathias's place was great. Very central - walking distance to all the good spots and no more than a 15 minutes by train to other hip parts of town. The place was clean, big, and a great spot to spend 3+ weeks in Stockholm. Mathias was very good with communication. I would recommend this apartment to anyone looking for a great place to stay in Stockholm."
4689,723539,142060378,2017-04-06,1673947,Daniel,"Mathias was an excellent host and communication was swift. Very central apartment on Östermalm, walking distance to all the shops and restaurants on and around Stureplan. Highly recommended."

4691,723539,148683708,2017-05-01,55121244,Reut,"Mathias's apartment is bright, clean and well connected to public transportation. Mathias was easy to communicate with."
4692,723539,149618795,2017-05-05,19355341,Lucía,"Conocimos a Mathias quien muy gentilmente nos permitió hacer el check in antes del horario establecido, nos dio instrucciones muy estrictas respecto del apartamento y del funcionamiento (lo cual es entendible dado que es su vivienda propia).
En lineas generales el apartamento esta bien, es amplio, muy ordenado, y sobre todo muy bien situado en una zona céntrica lo que permite recorrer los puntos mas importantes de la ciudad a pie, rodeada de bares, restaurantes y comercios. 
Como punto negativo encontramos que la cama es pequeña y las almohadas un tanto incomodas y por otro lado las cortinas dejan pasar la luz de la mañana! "
4693,723539,164457644,2017-06-27,13258202,Claudio,"Spacious, luminous and very well located apartment, near the heart of the city without disturbing noises. Ideal for 2 to 3 people. Well equipped ( although there´s no microwave oven or toaster) Wifi is only for laptops. The host was always available for every need we had. He is very strict with his house rules, so be sure to read them before rent the apartment. "
4694,723539,168241327,2017-07-09,88560376,Kristy,Great location. Mathias was a kind host. As it is a private house you are expected to tidy up and clean up when you leave. 
4695,723539,169943969,2017-07-14,28268162,Marini,"His house is very clean, more than 15 minutes walk to reach the beach and more attractions, only about five minutes there are two supermarkets, very convenient"
4696,723539,171338236,2017-07-17,128412940,Geoffrey,Very quiet and comfortable good central location. Would definitely stay there again if in Stockholm. Recommend. 
4697,723539,172581467,2017-07-21,32714850,Crystal,"My family and I enjoyed our stay at Mathias' apartment. The check in and out processes were smooth. The apartment is clean, cozy, and as described (note: no microwave or wifi) - the balcony is nice for summer. It is close to the subway but also within walking distance to many of the major sights."
4698,723539,175495486,2017-07-29,23121829,Donna,Very neat and clean....exactly as pictured.  The apartment was indeed quite.  Note there is no internet which is needed as a traveler but coffee shops can be used easily.  More bath towels are needed....luckly I packed extras.
4699,723539,179194408,2017-08-07,14525028,Kimberley,"I had a wonderful stay at Mathias' place. It was lovely, clean and spacious, the perfect spot to discover Stockholm. 
Lack of wifi was a slight challenge but laptop internet USB is kindly provided. 
The apartment is very bright which is beautiful during the day but I did wake up at 5.30am every morning - so great for early birds!"
4700,723539,185211801,2017-08-21,122031080,Helen,Beautiful flat in a great location in a wonderful city!
4701,723539,187108063,2017-08-26,44404734,Francesca,"Mathias's apartment is just as in the pictures--airy, elegant, well-appointed and super clean. It is also extremely conveniently located, just a short walk up from Ostermalm station and walking distance to the historic centre. Lots of cafes and restaurants around, and also the wonderful food hall."
4702,723539,188735277,2017-08-30,30191599,Jennifer,"The apartment was clean and a good place to stay. We were three girls and had enough space. The location is good. You can walk to the main places and there is a supermarket and some restaurants around.
Mathias was friendly and there were no problems with the comunication. 
Highly recommended."
4703,723539,199137811,2017-10-01,3788977,Anju,"My husband and I traveled with our toddler for 4 nights and would best describe it as a sunny 1 bed flat in a great location (Ostermalm). 

If you're traveling more carefree it's a nice, quirky, plant-filled apartment in a location that is close to lots of things. Those traveling with children should note there isn't a microwave, or toaster and curtains are thin...but we were happily relieved when our daughter managed to go back to sleep after dawn! There is also an absolutely lovely playground only a 5-7 min walk at Humlegarden. 

We had a little hiccup with our check in as Mathias just started using Instant Book and our booking was done the day before, so we got Airbnb to help us, but pretty sure it was a one off as Mathias communicated well with us thereafter and even express posted the USB wifi stick he had forgot to leave at the flat.

Mathias seemed like a friendly guy when he popped around to pick up some items. Something we didn't realise when we booked is it's very much his home in that he lives there the majority of the time and his stuff is there. That meant we could use things like his olive oil etc. and not buy our own, which is great and get a little glimpse into the life of a Stockholm resident!"

4705,723539,214680841,2017-11-26,26817288,Haridos,"Stunning apartment in a great location. Beautifully put together with all the necessary amenities. The only thing missing is an internet connection, but to be honest I don't go to places to spend it inside on my computer, so it wasn't an issue for me, and the access to 4G pretty much everywhere (including the subways!) makes up for it.
Would highly recommend for any trips and would definitely stay again!"
4706,723539,231442542,2018-02-01,116731317,Caroline,"I loved staying at Mathias's place. All of his directions were spot on, making it very easy to get to his place. The location was PERFECT, only one metro stop away from Central Station, easy access to all buses, and in a great, safe neighbourhood. The heated bathroom floors were a nice perk for cold, winter mornings. Mathias was very easy to communicate with and happy to help with any questions or needs. The only downside was no wifi, but it was easy to make do without it as there are many cafes nearby. I highly recommend staying here!!!"
4707,723539,238233256,2018-02-25,166082861,Chantelle,"Mathias was a great host, his place was absolutely fantastic, I loved the balcony and the plants and the heated bathroom floor. Location was perfect and communication with Mathias was great, he was even so nice as to drop off extra toilet paper and let me extend another night. Thanks for your hospitality :)"

4712,723539,260937445,2018-05-05,6185021,Evgeny,"Mathias made our stay in Stockholm very comfortable. The communication with him was fast and efficient. House rules are clear and very reasonable. Sorting out the garbage is even a small quest, which makes you smile sometimes and adds a charm to living in his apartment. Apartment is very well located: 10 minutes by foot to Royal Drama Theatre, which is the beginning of Strandvägen, 13 minutes to Gamla Stan, 15 minutes to Djurgården. We stayed for 5 full days and never used public transportation or taxi, not a small change in Stockholm. In a few minutes by foot there are also have two reasonably priced food stores Coop (more expensive) and Hemköp (less expensive, larger choice). The apartment is definitely a good price/quality ratio for Stockholm. You should only know that probably a family of three is maximum what we would advise as a group, the place is not so large, but very homely. One very small caveat: if you need wifi, you should either buy a local SIM card, either have a generous roaming plan, as mobile modem works perfectly, but only with one device with USB port at a time.  Definitely recommend to grab Mathias's apartment if it is available."
4713,723539,263438975,2018-05-12,10341014,Dan,"Very cozy place with nice location. Great balcony. The beds are a bit on the narrow side, but might not be a problem if one is used to sleeping close"
4714,723539,270828301,2018-05-30,12395248,Léo,Mathias a beaucoup de règles et a passé beaucoup de temps à nous les rappeler ce qui ne nous a pas mis à l'aise. Je garde un souvenir amère de ce voyage même si l'appartement de Mathias est bien (lits petits mais appartement propre) et très bien situé.

The shower and kitchen are a bit tight but very functional.  The bed, a double, was fine for me but might be tight for a couple.  Mathis makes clear in his listing things that are not there, such as TV, microwave, wifi (but a USB is provided for laptop), so no surprises.  I was there for a month and found the apartment to be excellent."
4729,723539,320581030,2018-09-09,13780029,Anna,"The place is great and charming. Location is very convenient, check-in and check-out are easy, the place is equipped with everything necessary and more, a balcony is nice.

Our only concern is that the main bed is smaller than a queen size which is small for our standard. Two persons can fit but it is a bit narrow. Thanks for all Mathias!!!

Many restaurants, bars and important sights are within walking distance (Gamla stan, Norrmalm, Djurgården, Strandvägen where many boat trips start). The appartment is tidy and you find there everything you need. It is perfect for a couple, a couple with kids or for 2-3 friends. Communication with Mathias was great. I highly recommend the spot!"

A lovely clean bathroom with wetroom shower. 
The lounge area is great and wooden floors throughout were lovely to walk on in bare feet.
The ICA supermarket was 5 mins walk opposite the Stadion tube station and sold everything we needed.
We would definitely recommend staying here - the host was very attentive throughout our stay."

The terrace is nice to have breakfast in the mornig, or a glas of wine in the evening..

4750,739726,3010144,2012-12-02,379538,Nicolas,"Sannas apartment is one of those places on AirBnB that you feel lucky to have stayed in once you've been there. It's a nice  space in Södermalm. Steps away from Cafés, very nice stores and a short walk to everything else in the neighborhood. We would stay there again. Sanna was very easy to communicate with before and during the stay. That's always helpful!"

4752,739726,3113569,2012-12-18,4225836,Gaëlle,"Stockholm l'hiver, c'est faire l'expérience d'une nuit qui ne finit jamais ! On a été absolument charmés par la gentillesse des suédois, la beauté et l'énergie de la ville, et les très jolies boutiques du quartier de Sofo.

Idéal pour un week-end, mais on y aurait bien passé une semaine !

D'autant qu'on a été particulièrement bien accueillis par Sanna, qui a un très joli studio en plein cœur de Sofo. Zen, très propre, chaleureux et romantique, idéal pour une personne seule ou un couple, avec toutes ces petites lumières qui font le charme des intérieurs de Suède. Nous recommandons chaleureusement !"

Lägenheten var lagom för vårt behov av övernattning i ett tyst område utan störande trafik och ändå nära till butiker och T-bana."

4757,739726,3593111,2013-02-20,863686,David,"We stayed at Sanna's beautiful apartment for four nights in February 2013 and couldn't have been happier.  Sanna has created a warm, comfortable, stylish home we loved staying in.  The apartment is in the heart of 'Sofo' in Södermalm and is minutes away from a range of excellent, unique restaurants, bars, shops, galleries etc.  It is within walking distance of all the main areas of interest in Stockholm - we only used the train twice in four days!.

Sanna was friendly and responsive from first contact.  She gave us a warm welcome on arrival and made some great recommendations for places to eat and drink.

We can't wait to go back.  Thank you Sanna!"

The apartment itself is spotless , very functional for a couple and equipped will all that you need to make yourself feel at home.
In addition the tasteful decor creates a beautiful ambience and then the Swedish tradition of candles through the house really give it good Zen. Sanna was very welcoming and waiting for us when we arrived in the middle of a snowstorm. Due to the large windows the apartment captures a lot of natural light. Just around the corner are a bakery and several cafes and groovy restaurants. In all the perfect place for a couple."

It's tastefully decorated, spacious enough for two persons, fully equipped and offers everything you need. The bed is very comfortable. The place is in a quiet side street in a great location not too far from the T-bana station in the heart of SoFo, with great shops and restaurants around the corner. Moreover, Sanna was very very nice and helpful. We truly enjoyed our stay in Sanna's place. And if we ever make it back to Stockholm, hopefully Sanna's place will be available again! "

4773,739726,5598369,2013-07-08,4900750,Roberta,"Sanna's place is a charming, comfortable and quiet apartment, very well located in a cool and convenient neighbourhood full of boutiques and cafes, close to transport and even walkable to the city. The apartment had everything we wanted for our stay: a well-equipped kitchen, convivial dining area, spacious loungey living room, super-clean bathroom, and romantic bedroom alcove with decadent, velvety and - most importantly - light-blocking drapes(allowing us the best sleep we had in our Scandinavian summer trip). Tastefully and personally decorated, but not at all cluttered, so one feels right at home. Our host Sanna was a great communicator: prompt and efficient, and that, coupled with easy car access for loading, unloading and night parking, made booking, check-in and check-out smooth as silk. We strongly recommend Sanna's place and would be delighted to stay again."

Closest café (Il Caffé) has good coffee, sticky buns and Wi-Fi - Gilda Café nice but no Wi-Fi.  We found bus no. 76, an easy walk from apt. even with luggage, takes you to Kungstradgarden and on to St. Peters Line ferry terminal. Without luggage, walking to Gamla Stan and beyond very do-able.  Sanna a cheery hostess.  We look forward to having a coffee with you one day in Sydney.  July, 2013 "
4776,739726,6555775,2013-08-17,6397578,G. María,"We had a fantastic stay at Sanna's place. The place is just as welcoming and clean as the pictures show it to be. Sanna greeted us at her place and we were able to chat for a bit. She is a great host and gave us some tips on dining places around her neighborhood. We really liked the area, lots of cafes and bars, and grocery stores. While she does not offer WiFi in her apartment, this was not a big deal, as there are 2 cafes, one right around the corner and also Il Caffe, both of which were ideal. Great breakfast and good coffee. The apartment is larger than we thought and very comfortable. More room than we even needed. We had no problems catching the bus to town (#76 I believe?). We also walked to the water, which is close to her place and took a boat into town. After touring several areas of Stockholm, we were very glad we stay in this neighborhood. Very artsy, with young families everywhere, very few tourists. We loved Stockholm and we would definitely stay here again. Thank you! "
4777,739726,6682848,2013-08-21,337548,Anthony & Matthew,"Sanna's flat in Central Sodermalm is in a great location for Stockholm's groovy cafes and bars, as well as close to transport links.

Location was great. Neighborhood felt very safe and we walked everywhere. Walk to Gamla Stan was about 20 minutes. A really nice walk. 

I would highly recommend this place!

Sanna coordinated to meet us at the apartment and even though we were running a little late it wasn't a problem. The apartment itself was nice and very clean with a quality shower and comfortable bed.  The area around the apartment is within walking distance to good bars and restaurants and close to the downtown/old town area.

Public transport to all other areas and attractions is 5-10 mins away. The apartment itself is more a studio set-up than a separate bedroom but is perfect for a couple and is decorated with real personality - a welcoming, cosy and relaxing space. Sanna was a friendly and helpful host. I highly recommend this as a great place from which to explore beautiful Stockholm. Thanks Sanna!"

During the nights it was quiet and the bath is a big plus when it's cold outside. Sanna's is a great host who's easy to communicate with. All in all: We had a great stay!!

4792,739726,8969111,2013-11-29,5227141,Jaycee,"Sanna's apartment was clean, lovely, homely and beautifully decorated reflecting peace and tranquility. It's in the Södermalm district which has really cool cafes and shops around so one does not have to worry about places to eat. Sanna was really helpful in recommending places to us and showing us the apartment and laundry facilities. The stockholm old town is reachable 20 minutes by foot. Enjoyed the stay in her apartment thoroughly."

4794,739726,12832988,2014-05-12,375383,Vanessa & Thibault,"We stayed in Sanna's appartment 4 nights and enjoyed it very much. Great location, surrounded by many cafés and restaurants. The appartment was clean and comfortable. Sanna is a great host and we recommand her place! "
4795,739726,13212597,2014-05-22,13717687,John,"Sanna is very personable.  When you first meet her, it feels like you have already known her for years.  She clearly, and understandably, loves her city and the neighborhood.  She is very easy to talk to and feel comfortable with, and gave us helpful tips on places nearby we might like to visit, such as restaurants, coffee shops, and grocery stores. Very nice lady.

The listing exceeded our expectations.  Primarily we came as tourists, expecting to do a lot of sight-seeing, while still keeping in mind that we'd like to experience Stockholm from a resident's point of view.  However because of our jet lag, we relied on the apartment more than originally anticipated.  It was clean, organized, comfortable, and functional.  All you need to do is go to ICA (be sure to try the smoked salmon, they can cut for you at the deli).  You will have just about everything you need to be comfortable.
 
This location was perfect because it is the part of town that is only 3 stops from the city center.  We were there for only 3 days and got a 72 hour pass to use the transit system at the airport.  So, we needed to see as much as possible in a very short amount of time.  Although we could have walked to just about everywhere, the pass helped us save time in a few cases.

With our pass, we could travel very easily all over the city.  We particularly like the location because it is a little bit out of the way of old town (and other tourists).  We could walk to the main street for all our basic needs, and even get an idea of how it would feel to live there, since we lived among the locals.  But when we were out being tourists, we had very easy access to all the main points of interest.  If you're planning to rely on the transit system, I highly recommend getting a transit pass. Also if you plan to spend your time in Stockholm, it seems like it would be difficult to navigate using a car.

In late May, there's a lot of daylight.  We're visiting from San Francisco and this neighborhood felt very safe to us.  In Sanna's neighborhood, most of the residents were young professionals.  There are some similarities between San Francisco and Stockholm.  You have to watch out for bicyclists, but they seem more organized than the ones in San Francisco."
4796,739726,13606394,2014-06-01,12956118,Aurore,"Sanna's flat is very nice and cosyn typically swedish style flats. The location is great, near all the cafes and restaurants in the great quarter of Sodermalm. You can walk easily to city center. Very nice person; we are very pleased!!"
4797,739726,13874059,2014-06-07,12884639,Pat,"Sanna is a lovely lady.  I met her at the apartment and chatted with her and immediately felt like I had known her for a long time.  I recently stayed at Sanna's apartment in Sodermalm for 5 nights and it was lovely.  Her apartment was as shown in her profile and within a vibrant neighbourhood.  The location of the apartment is perfectly situated, with lots of little shops and restaurants within a short walking distance.  There are a number of supermarkets nearby (take your pick).  You can also easily walk to Gamla Stan in under 30 minutes, but the metro is very convenient.  Make sure you ask Sanna about the location of the charming cottages in the neighbourhood and the lookout walk at the edge of Sodermalm."
4798,739726,14079557,2014-06-11,13689318,Florian,"We spent 4 nights in Sanna's apartment and had a wonderful time. The apartment is centrally located in a very nice area of Södermalm and can easily be reached by metro; it was very clean, cosy and comfortable and we really liked the very tasteful decoration.

Sanna was a great and very friendly host, although we arrived late in the evening she waited for us and gave us good tips on the best places to go in the neighbourhood. 

We would definitely come back!"

Il quartiere è molto carino, vicino al centro, vivace ma fuori dalle orde di turisti. sembra una zona davvero ""verace"".
Sanna è stata gentilissima e disponibile. Ci ha dato un sacco di informazioni utili ed abbiamo fatto con lei una chiacchierata davvero divertente.
Se torneremo a Stoccolma (e vogliamo davvero tornare presto) saremo felici di tornare ad alloggiare nel suo appartamento."

In a great neighborhood with lots of trendy places to eat and not a lot of tourists.  She does not have wireless, which is stated.  We thought that was the only drawback to this otherwise lovely, clean and cozy place."

The apartment is clean and area is not noisy.
Quite close to subway.
Very good."
4806,739726,19033058,2014-09-05,3473482,Patrick,Thanks Sanna for a great apartment - it was exactly as described - with very clear directions on how to find - wonderfully located and within walking distance of everything - I only used public transport to go to the archipelago. The apartment is beautiful - very quiet even though so well located. I am already planning a return trip.
4807,739726,19363694,2014-09-11,7364554,Courtney,"Sanna was a great host. I didn't have a chance to meet her in person, though my mother did at the end of our stay. That said, Sanna was very accommodating and easy to communicate with via email. Both my mother and I enjoyed the neighbourhood, Södermalm, immensely. There were numerous terrific bars, cafes, and restaurants all within blocks. We were lucky to have great weather and were able to walk all over Stockholm, however the place was very close to a subway stop. The apartment itself was very clean and welcoming. We didn't spend much time at the apartment, but the size seemed just fine for two people. Thanks Sanna! "
4808,739726,19920111,2014-09-21,189636,Bent,"Vielen Dank an Sanna. Sehr nettes, kleines Apartment, die Bilder entsprechen der Realität. Man hat alles, was man braucht. Ruhig und doch sehr zentral gelegen, mitten im nettesten Viertel Stockholms. Gleich um die Ecke jede Menge nette Deli's und Restaurants für morgens und abends. Sanna ist jederzeit bemüht, alles zu regeln. Gerne wieder, wir können es als Unterkunft für 2 Personen sehr empfehlen."
4809,739726,20334336,2014-09-28,17546003,Nicole,"We really loved our stay in Stockholm and staying in Sanna's apartment really made us feel we lived there - and very much enjoyed doing so.  Sanna was a great and generous host right from the first contact, really amenable to any of our requests and providing great directions, as well as emergency contacts.  The area of Soedermalm is fab - lots of great shops and little places to eat everywhere and in very easy reach - especially the wonderful bakery Fabrique just down the road which has the most delicious bread:-) - very important to me, as I am orginally from Austria;-).
Because we didn't have such luck with the weather - it was raining when we arrived and on the next day - it was even better, to be able to stay in in the morning, reading a book in Sanna's serene flat - rather than having to sit awkwardly on a bed in a hotel room.  We would highly recommend Sanna and her lovely home as a place to stay - and she might well see us again, as our 5 days didn't give us nearly enough time to see and do everything we wanted to in this beautiful town."
4810,739726,20789819,2014-10-05,1507323,Phim,"This is a really nice apartment. It was well kept and extremely clean, and in a lovely part of Stockholm. There is a great cafe across the road that does delicious cinnamon buns, and I felt it was a clean and safe. The bedroom is in an alcove off the living room. I made a mistake when booking and didn't see that there was no internet -I really do think this should be in the flat description and not just buried in the list of amenities. Unfortunately the host was not great about responding to my concerns and we didn't get to meet at my scheduled arrival as she had to catch a boat.   Overall a positive experience but I was a little upset about the lack of communication. "
4811,739726,20944547,2014-10-08,5674784,Derek,"Sanna was there right on the agreed time for us to get into the flat. It was a grey few days outside, but there was plenty of good light, including candles in the flat. I liked the decor, reflecting some of the host's travels to Bali. Great wall masks! 
The area is absolutely ideal for local coffee and eats. 
For once, it was lovely not to have wifi. No phone beeping, and we could actually get back to reading, stretching and relaxing. "
4812,739726,21637188,2014-10-20,22436438,Jonas,"Sanna was a great host.
Even though we arrived really late at night she organised the key delivery fabulously.
The apartment's location is excellent, right in the centre of the hip district Södermalm. We also really enjoyed the harmonic Asian touch of her flat, which was very clean and well equipped.
Overall, we can recommend her accomodation without any restrictions!"

It’s really well located in Södermalm and we were pleasantly surprised to find that a lot of the shops/cafes/restaurants recommended online are just around the corners - The English Bookshop literally just downstairs, Grandpa shop 1 mins walk away, as well as Meatball for the People & Bluelight Yokohama etc.  Her room is tastefully decorated with lots of individuality, which we really appreciate.  We didn’t get to meet Sanna in person as she is on holiday abroad but she is very welcoming and responsive via messages. Highly recommend! "
4821,739726,300954006,2018-08-03,102664727,Jerome,"Nous avons passé un super séjour chez Sanna. Nous avons été accueilli par Olle, une de ces connaissances, qui a été très professionnel. L’appartement est parfait (très propre, décoré avec goût, très équipé et fonctionnel) dans une belle résidence très calme. La rue est aussi très calme. Nous avons adoré le quartier : chouettes boutiques, de décoration notamment, restaurant, café... C’est d’ailleurs le quartier que nous avons préféré. 
Bref si je devais retourner à Stockholm j’irai chez Sanna et je le recommanderais à mon entourage ( ce que j’ai déjà d’ailleurs fait hier à mon voisin en lui parlant de mon séjour en Suède).
Merci encore Sanna et bon retour chez vous. "

The communication was immediate and easy check in and out. The apartment is beautiful, very quiet, fully equipped (our children enjoyed the large TV screen) and perfectly located to discover Stockholm. We had a rented car and no problems finding a space to park. Across the street is super market, the area full with nice bars and restaurants."
4834,748847,14362980,2014-06-17,835506,Anthony,"I communicated with Heath over email with great ease - he left clear instructions fir all the basics and in fact we never met him face-to-face. His place was spacious and perfect for 3 friends traveling. The apartment was well appointed and quiet. It is very near all the hot-spots in Sodermalm and we just strolled a few meters to whatever we needed or desired.

This apartment represents extremely good value for money with no hassle whatsoever.

I can highly recommend this listing!"

Location is very quiet even in evenings, but if go just two blocks you will find a plenty of bars, pubs and cafes with all type of cuisine and activities. There is also a 10 minutes walking distance to Gamla stan and the center of Stockholm."
4837,748847,27199464,2015-02-28,24470159,Annika,"Lägenheten var jättefin och hade allt man kan önska sig. Fullt utrustat kök, supers snabbt  Wifi samt en stor tv. Lägenheten ligger i ett lugnt område, men ändå centralt och nära till allt.
Vi bodde där i två och en halv månad, två vuxna och två barn (6 och 8 år) och det fungerade alldeles utmärkt. 
Heath är en perfekt värd, trevlig och hjälpsam. Även om vi aldrig träffade honom, hade vi väldigt smidig kommunikation. Han svarade alltid snabbt på alla våra frågor.
Jag kan verkligen rekommendera Heaths boende till alla som vill besöka Stockholm.
Annika Johansson"

There's nothing like stepping out of the shower unto a heated bathroom floor. He even kindly left my friends and me a bottle of wine. I would certainly recommend this place. Thanks, Heath!"
4839,748847,34814249,2015-06-12,1037156,Helena,"Heath's apartment was lovely! Full of light, very photogenic, walkable to everything you'd wanna do (or bikeable - a rack of city bikes is just a block or two away and you can buy a bike card at the nearby 7/11). The neighborhood is much quieter and with much less traffic than the city center, but still super hip and full of great food and shopping. Would stay again."
4840,748847,37045473,2015-07-04,31362468,Maria,"Thank you Heath for this wonderful experience!
Everything was as described. The house was clean and comfortable.
Location is perfect!"
4841,748847,42295965,2015-08-12,11624599,Kenneth,Absolutely wonderful experience.  Heath's advice for airport transportation were very helpful.  This was our first time in Sweden and our only regret was that we couldn't stay a bit longer. n The apartment was exactly as described and suited our family of three perfectly.  We found all of the cooking necessities and were only a few minutes to a grocery store.  Great location.  Great beds. Great Kitchen.
4842,748847,63880616,2016-02-28,49165549,Tom,"Heath's place was perfect for my stay in Stockholm. A great space, a great location and a great host! He was quick to reply to any questions that I had, and suggested some really good options for places to check out locally. Highly recommend if you're looking for a place to stay in Soder!!"
4843,748847,82832303,2016-06-29,14010127,Chanti,"Communication was very swift and accurate with Heath, before, during and after our stay at his lovely VERY centrally located apartment. The place was great for us as a small family but I am sure it is also great for people who want to discover the nightlife of Sodermam a bit. And having all types of ketchup (!), pickles and chilli powder to use is great to be able to actually cook some meals.

At a stones throw away there is a ICA supermarket that does fresh croissants from 9 in the morning and bigger shops are only down the road too. 

We brought our children with us, the playgrounds in the neighbourhood are really nice and have someone to actually entertain the kids a bit. A new experience to us.

Overall a very good experience to stay at Heaths apartment and would def recommend"
4844,748847,97358030,2016-08-27,13914048,Gonzalo,"Heath was very nice and helpful in everything. From providing all needed thugs for out baby (cradle, high chair...) to guiding us for better transportation.
The apartment if great and the location very very good. Close to the public transport and in a nice and trendy area of the city. There if also a great park for kids close to the apartment. 
The apartment is very nicely furnished and has very thing you need, even Netflix and TIVO, with (real) high speed internet and a large TV.
Highly recommended."
4845,748847,100664780,2016-09-10,5854175,Gilbert,"Heath was awesome!  He gave very clear instructions on how to gain access to the apartment, utilize the appliances, and navigate around town.  Also, his recommendations for sights and experiences were superb.  We have a young family, so he went ahead and placed a high chair in the apartment and rebuilt an IKEA crib for our daughter.  The area ,Sodermalm, was one of the coolest, hippest, and safest places I'd ever been.  He and his apartment were super fantastic.  Definitely book this place for vacation and time with your family in one the most family friendly cities in the world.  Thanks for a great experience, Heath."
4846,748847,129906347,2017-02-03,29767330,Melynda,"Not only does Heath go out of his way to assist you with every enquiry in exceptional time but his stunning apartment is everything and more that is described! 
Location - Central, close to transport, AMAZING neighbourhood, great restaurants lots of nightlife yet quiet and residential all at the same time!

Appearance- Heath's apartment was spotless! 
Well equiped with all modern appliances. 
Lovely plants on all the window ledges, beautiful full length windows and Lots of sunlight. - There are no curtains on the main living area so be aware if you are wandering around half dressed :)  
Bedroom - This was surprisingly larger than expected !
Beds - Very comfortable with lots of clean fresh linnen !

Pär is a very thoughtful host, he was amazingly helpful throughout the whole process and gave us the warmest welcome ever in Stockholm as well as all the informations and advices we needed. He did everything possible to make our stay enjoyable and so it was because it really felt like home! 
Check-in and check-out were simple and communication was always impeccable.

The apartment is brighter and bigger than appears in the photo, equipped with everything needed for a pleasant stay. It is enough for 4 adults. It is located near the train station and the town hall (three stations bus, station is right in front of the building), but about 15 minutes easy walk. The area is beautiful, clean and safe. Right across the apartament is a little food.
Par is a great host, he gave us directions to get to the apartment, he waited us, he introduced the apartment and gave us information about its surroundings and about sightseeing in Stockholm (gave us and maps and brochures with various useful information for tourists).
If I get back in Stockholm, I will definitely stay here again."

The apartment was the perfect size for my wife and I plus two kids.  The location is good as you can easily walk to the Metro or along the water to downtown.  We loved the neighborhood with our kids as there was easy grocery shopping nearby, great city parks with kids play areas, and an easy walk to all metro or boat transportation.  Par was super nice and had lots of info about the area to help.  After doing museums and activities for days which tired out the kids, it was nice to have a great neighborhood with parks and even a little beach nearby plus lots of cafes to just relax.  Having a kitchen were we could cook meals for the family really helped make the trip affordable for us. "

He even had a bottle of champagne for us in the fridge! You should know that this is not an anonymous vacation apartment, but his real home, so we were very grateful that he let us stay in it. The location is very convenient (close to restaurants, shops, buses, and the water) and we felt very safe and at home. We can highly recommend this apartment, and we will try to stay there again next time we are in Stockholm.

4877,755843,109238601,2016-10-20,31966644,Jacob And Kate,"We had an awesome experience staying at Pär's apartment in Stockholm. Pär had excellent communication throughout, provided plenty of useful information regarding our stay in Stockholm and was very welcoming (even had a bottle of champagne waiting for us!). 

The apartment itself was exactly as described and was safe, quiet, clean and comfortable. The location was great for us, about a 15 minute walk from downtown Stockholm, but right next to multiple easy public transport options. The neighborhood was great as well, with plenty of grocery stores, restaurants, etc nearby, plus a lovely stretch of waterfront nearby to relax at. 

Loved staying at Pär's place, would highly recommend and stay there again when in Stockholm."
4878,755843,111448832,2016-10-31,21391771,Françoise,"Pär nous attendait à notre arrivée à l'appartement.
Il nous a donné tous les renseignements dont nous aurions besoin pour le logement, les visites et les déplacements.
L'appartement est confortable, chaleureux nous avons vraiment eu l'impression de ""vivre à la suédoise""
Bus au pied de la porte, arrêt de bus pour Arlanda à deux arrêts.
Séjour très agréable
Merci Pär!"

We had a great stay with 4 people and enjoyed the time in Pärs flat. 2 of us slept in the bed and 2 on the couch. Living room and bedroom are separated by a curtain without a door. The flat is equipped with everything you need for relaxing and cooking. Stockholm is a great city! 
4887,755843,124551575,2017-01-02,33032117,Katalin,"Par was super helpful and accommodating our late arrival and suggested what to do and where to go nearby and in the city that might be of interest.

4892,755843,138725473,2017-03-21,6488011,Kerstin,Lägenheten ligger perfekt för de som vill gärna upptäcka stan. Man kan promenera vid mälaren till centrum/Gamla Stan. Det finns olika busslinjer just rund hörnet. Lägenheten själv är i ett lugnt hus och sängen är verkligen bekväm. Pär är en jättesnäll gästgivare. Han visade runt och hadde mycket information förberedd för oss. Det var trevligt att stanna hos honom. Tack!
4893,755843,141102688,2017-04-02,29052185,Julia,"Pärs bolig was amazing. He waited for us outside his place where he greeted us welcome. He gave us a full tour of the appartment, gave advice on shopping possibilities, where public transportion could be found and so on. Pär was very guestfree and had set a bottle of champagne in the fridge for us and let us use all tea, coffee, ketchup etc. that were om the cabinnets. The appartment was close to the center, public transportation and a beautiful harbor only 1 minute away. The neighboorhood was also very quiet. We would definitely love to come back again! "
4894,755843,142006068,2017-04-06,18952871,Dat,"The house is very cosy and easily commute to virtually anywhere in Stockholm. Par is very friendly and informative, he also quickly replied to any of my enquiries."
4895,755843,143966805,2017-04-14,110181529,Javier,Me and my family had a good time in Pär's apartment. It is comfortable and fully equipped. It is really well located because the bus stopping just at the door carries you to many tourist attractions and the walk from there to the city hall by the lake is really nice. Recommendable!
4896,755843,146891689,2017-04-24,116957491,Lorenzo,"The only regret was that we didn't meet Pär in person, but communication is certainly not lacking with timely responses on (Hidden by Airbnb) and airbnb. The apartment is beautiful and roomy and is located very close to Stockholm's places of interest.
In addition, the apartment is provided with several poster, stock maps with information about the main points of interest of the city.
If I go back to Stockholm I hope I can stay at Pär's apartment again.

Really good and calm location, perfect accessibility by public transport, walk-able distance from downtown even for 9/10 years kids, nice playground within 15 minutes walk. Several supermarkets around the place.
Place to return in Stockholm."

I recommend to everybody. Moreover Par is a good host"
4902,755843,162949489,2017-06-23,95457403,Giuliano,"Nice apartment in a quiet area. The bus stop is just 30 mt from the entrance and reaches the city center in 10 minutes. It takes 5-10 minutes to walk to subway and main stores, but a mini market open till midnight is located just in front of the house. The apartment is composed by a kitchen, a living room, a bedroom and 2 bathrooms (blind). A small terrace gives a view on the street and nearby lake (100 mt).
There is enough space for a family of 4 people, note that the children shall sleep on the couch. The apartment is a real one, so you will find all kind of sauces in the fridge, herbs & dressings. Large screen tv with hundreds of channels, excellent wi-fi.
Pär gave us helpful tips for the public transportation and left the brochures for almost all Stockholm main attractions.
Recommended.

Buying a bus, metro ticket is worthwhile. Available at metro stations or 7 .11. Shops. Will definitely recommend this apartment to friends. Thank you Par for all the information."

4910,755843,183689632,2017-08-18,30053129,Nathalie,Pär à pris le temps de nous présenter l'appartement et ce que l'on pouvait faire à stockholm. Son appartement est agréable et bien placé . A recommander .
4911,755843,185894788,2017-08-23,1609664,Chris,"Location: This is an apartment located about a 20min walk from the central train station. Nearby are supermarkets (a corner store is across the street, too), drugstore, liquor store and restaurants. Although Stockholm can be difficult to see on foot sometimes because of the water barriers we found most places to be within an hour of the apartment and if you're crazy like us you can even walk to Drottningholm Palace to get a sense of the suburbs and take the boat back.

Communication: Upon our arrival in the city, Pär responded quickly on the AirBnB app and was there when we got to the apartment. 

The Residence: If you are an school AirBnB person like us who prefers staying at places that are actually lived in rather than just rented out as income, this a good choice, with his extensive book collection showing his love for travel and mystery novels. He made space for us in his fridge and utensils were available for cooking if we wanted. 

Overall: We were very happy with our stay and would definitely come again."
4912,755843,188008058,2017-08-28,10704795,Suzy,"Apartment: this was our first time staying in an Airbnb that is used as a primary residence. It was like staying in your uncle's bachelor pad. Not a beautiful place to relax and spend time, but a good place to come back to sleep that is safe, comfortable and spacious. A big bedroom and two bathrooms were a plus. It was clean and the pictures were accurate. 

Location: it's not walkable from anywhere unless you really love to walk a lot. Bus was about 10 minutes from the central station, other sites were 20-30+ minutes by bus and tram. This is a residential area and there isn't a lot close by, so this is a quieter neighborhood away from the tourists.

Communication was very easy, and we were pleased with our stay overall."
4913,755843,205538656,2017-10-22,71048082,Farha,"Amazing apartment and location. City center is easily accessible by bus within a few minutes. Apartment is clean, beautifully decorated and spacious. All amenities in place. I have had the most comfortable stay and Par is a wonderful host, ensuring all needs are taken care of."

4917,755843,269213928,2018-05-27,27740380,Alex,"We loved the apartment. The photos did not do it justice, as it was cosy and homely with lots of personal touches, and is lived in by the owner occasionally. So, the books, photos and things in the kitchen added real character. It was also very quiet on the fourth floor, and just off the main road, so quieter.

Par was very hospitable, and checked us in with a warm welcome, with plenty of tips and left us sparkling wine. He also let us leave luggage for the day at the end of the stay, and was very easy to communicate with before the stay. This was only my third Air B and B, and the best yet.

The apartment is very handy (30 seconds walk) to bus routes 3 to the Old Town, 50 and 54 (to Kungstradgarden, where you catch no 7 tram to the Djurgarden attractions) so was excellent for public transport. 10 minutes walk to the City Hall, and 3 minutes to the waterside Malarpaviljorgen floating bar/restauarant). Metro 5 minutes away. Convenience store opposite, or ICA supermarket and several restaurants (we liked French Bergamott) with 5 minutes down a small hill). So, ideally situated, in a local but safe neighbourhood. 

Thanks Par."
4918,755843,275621623,2018-06-11,50740941,Margarita,"Par apparment was very conveniently located. So close to everything. The house has everything you need. I was travelling with my mum and there is an extra bed in the living room which was very comfortable.  I would recommend Par appartment for sure.
El apartamento de Par esta muy bien situado y tiene todo lo que necesitas. Yo viajé con mi madre y tiene una cama extra en el salón muy cómoda.  Sin duda recomiendo  el apartamento  de Par."
4919,755843,281702433,2018-06-25,45516419,Ceil,"Pär is a super host for a very good reason. Not only was the apartment great and exactly as represented in the listing but also he was very helpful on the check-in.  There are a couple of things that aren’t covered in the listing and the reviews which might be good to know. First off, there are some stairs because the apartment is on a “half floor.” Despite the fact that we both use canes, this was not a serious problem especially since Pär helped us in with the luggage. The other thing that was not in the listing was that the building has laundry facilities in the basement. Pär  thoughtfully booked us a time so that we could continue our journey with clean clothes!

We would totally recommend this booking for anyone wanting a nice quiet place to stay in Stockholm with good access to transportation to get just about anywhere you want in the city."

Flexible check-in time, friendly check-in information. Convenience of bus stop right in front of apartment. 
Par's apartment is the apartment where he lives. 
I could not see him. But I guess he will be a kind and generous traveler through his apartment.
Thank you for Par's favour and sparkling wine.^^"

Das dritte Bett ist ein Ausklappbett im Flur , was etwas umständlich ist und eine extrem weiche Matraze hat ! Unser dritter Mann hat auf der Couch geschlafen - das ging gut und war bequem ! 
Leider haben wir erst am letzten Tag entdeckt , dass direkt neben der Unterkunft ein super gemütlicher Laden existiert , wo man fantastisches Frühstück erhält! Wenn ihr also mal keine Lust auf Frühstück machen habt , ist das eine Superadresse!"

4929,755843,350422236,2018-11-19,112164429,Jessica,"This is a great apartment for a stay in Stockholm. Conveniently located, within 10 minutes walking of a train station and close to buses. Having more than one bed was great but keep in mind that there is no door separating the bedroom and lounge room/ kitchen, just a curtain. So if you’re staying with someone who snores or is an early riser, bring ear plugs. There are still some stairs up to the apartment in addition to the lift. Getting the shower to work was a little tricky without some instructions. Maybe Pär usually explains this but unfortunately we couldn’t meet him to check in, and collected the key from a nearby store. 
Overall, a very big and convenient apartment. I would recommend."

В начале был сильный запах сигарет.
В квартире есть камин как и написано в описании.
Фотографии полностью соответствуют действительности.
На кухне есть все необходимое для приготовления пищи и приветственная бутылка шампанского в холодильнике.
В спальне большая кровать и широкий диван в гостиной; два туалета: один с ванной, другой в коридоре.
Хотя хозяин не смог лично нас встретить, но приезд был организован отлично.
В целом все было хорошо, рекомендую."

Pär is a great host, he left us a bottle of champagne as a welcome gift! All in all everything is as described, so we fully recommend visiting his place! :)"

Vi var særligt glade for at der var Chromecast og badekar i lejligheden, da vi ofte kom trætte tilbage til lejligheden. Det skal også nævnes at busforbindelserne lige ved lejligheden er rigtig gode. Vi tilbragte en hel dag på Naturhistorisk museum og på Skansen, for så at komme hjem og slappe af i lejlighedens store sofa. Vi vil klart anbefale lejligheden."

It was close to a bus and metro station but also the main sights were still walk able. He let us check in as soon as we arrived in Stockholm and when we had a late flight the last day - let us leave our bags at his place. All in all a very pleasant stay - thank you!

Kungsholmen area has supermarkets, restaurants, bus stops and metro stations and it's only 10 minutes away from Gamla Stan, the Old City and Norrmalm.  The flat is also really close to the sea for a relaxing walk. Highly recommended! Thanks Pär!"

в которой была бы не модная современная обстановка, а настоящий шведский стиль и домашний уют.
эта квартира полностью оправдала наши ожидания! 
а забота хозяина, сделала пребывание мега комфортным и позволила иначе взглянуть на Стокгольм.
надеюсь вернуться осенью, чтобы насладиться красотой парков и такой изменчивой погоды-)"

Par is very kind and his home is so beautiful, cozy and clean. The position is perfect to visit the city: there's a bus stop (center direction) near the palace and metro station 5minute by walk.

Pär was there to greet us when we arrived and he showed us around the apartment and told us how everything worked from the beds to transportation etc. The apartment was situated in a nice area but it was still close to the center. Altogether, we had a nice visit and would recommend!"
4945,755843,484628347,2019-07-09,28141330,Debra,Pär’s apartment was perfect. It is in a fantastic location - close to public transport but also you can walk everywhere in Stockholm and this apartment is in a prime location. It is also very comfortable. We utilized both the bedroom and the Murphy bed (pull down) and were so comfortable there. Pär was always quick to reply and had everything set up for us when we arrived. Will definitely stay here again in the future!
4946,755843,494338743,2019-07-24,92231369,Damien,"Perfect apartment for a family of 4, we had a nice trip in Stockholm. Really easy to use buses and subway around the flat."

La localisation est top. L’appartement est génial.
Merci Pär pour tout !!!"
4951,755843,523230443,2019-09-03,5332392,Daniela,Pärs appartment is super cozy and perfectly located for discovering Stockholm. Very good and easy communication with Pär and nice welcome drink. I would definitely come back!

4954,757320,4109782,2013-04-10,5392384,Anna,We had a great time staying with Barb.  The room was beautiful and the location was a great place to explore Stockholm from.  Barb was an excellent host!
4955,757320,4432702,2013-05-05,5576597,Irina,"The apartment is great (clean, cosy and comfortable) and Barb is a wonderful host. She is very welcoming and helping, staying in the room at her apartment was a pleasure. There was no problem with checking-in and checking out and guests can follow their own schedule all the time during the stay. The location is perfect and lets you easily get to all the popular districts of the city without using public transportation. At the same time, the subway station is 2 min walk from the place. The area around is nice and suitable for eating, shopping, having a walk, well, basically anything. If I visit Stockholm again, I will definetely try to use this accomodation as this is a great balance of all the advantages and a reasonable price. Barb, thank you much!"
4956,757320,4812549,2013-05-27,6125364,Milena,"Location of the room is perfect for exploring the city either by walking or using public transport. Room is good size and very clean and bright.
Bathroom is just opposite the room and is clean with towels provided.
Check in and check out is flexible which we found very useful.

It was a great stay.
Milena and Raf"
4957,757320,5068713,2013-06-10,1638909,Andrew,"I do not really have any complaints towards Barb. She is a very nice person, and am glad she was kind enough to host me. The main positives are comfortable bed, lift, bathroom close by, good wifi, and cheapest place i found which was close enough to the the city centre. Also has a metro stop close by. Be aware that the bathroom is shared not private, and the room has blinds which do not block the scandinavian 3am sunshine but no issues there. So no complaints really, just make sure your stay dates do not coincide with the stay of a loud-snoring relative hahaha! just kidding. Btw - very safe area! The garden in the image is a block away though."
4958,757320,5613316,2013-07-08,1462425,Pieterjan,"We absolutely loved our stay in Stockholm! We were there for 5 days (4 nights) and didn't even see everything. The appartment had a super location! 2 minutes walking from the best view on Gamla Stan and the rest of Stockholm. It is also a few minutes walking away from a public bike rental stand. The bike is definitely the best way to explore Stockholm, provided it isn't raining of course. A 3-day ticket was160 SEK (around 18€) and there is always a bike available. Just take it and drop it off somewhere else. 
Barb was very friendly and we could use the bathroom, kitchen and fridge without any problem. Everything was clean and bedcovers and towels very provided.
The area of the appartment (Södermalm) is a decent area and a good starting point for your trip in Stockholm.
Definitely approved!"
4959,757320,5815758,2013-07-17,3802707,Valeria,"Barb is a great host, easy-going and helpful. The room is nice, the bathroom is clean and the kitchen is very well-organized: what else you could ask for?? The best thing is the location, in a lively but quiet district, with cool cafè and clubs nearby, and just 2 min by foot from the metro Maria Torget (2-3 stops from the old city Gamla Stan). I definitly recommend it!  "
4960,757320,6221898,2013-08-04,7141818,Claire,We had a great stay at Barb's place. The room is bright and toilet/shower just across which makes it convenient. We didn't spend much time in the flat but Barb was always helpful and the location is great.

4963,757320,6753689,2013-08-24,972051,Cyril,"We had such a great time at Barb's place ! The appartment is very well located (just 10 min walking to Gamla Stan and at the top of the street corner, you'll find a very nice view over the city). The area was laid back and very secure (like everywhere else in Stockholm), close to a lovely park and nice shops and restaurants around. Regarding the appartment itself, although you share it together with Barb, you will feel like having your own privacy. It is very clean and cosy. Access to kitchen and fridge. The bedroom is in a corridor right in front of the bathroom, which is very convenient. The bathroom sharing was not a problem at all, it worked out perfectly. Barb is such a nice person, we really enjoyed chatting with her. If we come to Stockholm again, we'll definitely go back at her place. Very recommanded ! Barb, thank you so much for having us ! All the best :)"

4967,757320,7949033,2013-10-09,453365,Linh,"Barb was a lovely and gracious hostess. Her flat is clean and tidy and the bedroom had just enough room in there for two showgirls and their suitcases. Having the bathroom opposite the bedroom was a plus and there was ample space to get ready. The location of the flat was perfect as it was close to the T-bana if we wanted to take public transit, but it was so close to great bars and restaurants, Gamla Stan, and even the city centre, that we often chose to walk everywhere. Would definitely stay again!"
4968,757320,8054553,2013-10-14,8929680,Vincent,"Barb was nice. You have an acces to the kitchen. The bathroom is near the (Website hidden by Airbnb) appartement is well place, near the center, if you are not afraid to walk, you can avoid the metro. Also near 2 big supermarkets to buy all you need for cooking. The appartment is not very soundproof. But it's ok. "
4969,757320,11843899,2014-04-16,9553746,Vasileios,"Everything perfect!!! The appartment is perfect and clean, and the bed very comfortable . As for the position it is optimal, cause you're real close to the Metro station and in 5-10 min walk you may arrive in the old city. Barbara was very kind and accommodating and provided everything. I surely recommend Barbara!!!!"
4970,757320,12344424,2014-04-29,1450780,Na,The room and bathroom was very clean. The bed was comfortable. The location of the apartment is perfect. We were a little surprised when Barb opened the door to our room one morning without waiting for our response ... we were still in bed .. Otherwise the stay was perfect! Stockholm is a beautiful city!
4971,757320,12919404,2014-05-14,2668332,Quan,The location is perfect for traveller to explore city. Room and bathroom are both big and clean. 
4972,757320,13421201,2014-05-27,3183086,Sophie,"Die Unterkunft war sehr sauber und das Zimmer war ausreichend groß. Die Gastgeberin Barb ist sehr freundlich und lässt einem die notwendigen Freiheiten. Küche inkl. Kühlschrank durfte auch benutzt werden.
Das Viertel insbesondere die Straße, in der sich die Wohnung befindet, war noch besser als wir uns es vorgestellt hatten - sehr jung, hip mit viele Bars und Cafés.
"
4973,757320,13546154,2014-05-30,15254114,Robyn,"Great place to stay at. Barb was very accommodating. My partner was able to join me   for the last of three nights. He had been on tour performing. When I arrived the room was made up beautifully with lots of information pamphlets and she left me  lovely jug of lemon water for the first night after having spent the day and evening helping my partner with his performance. The location of the apartment was superb and if you wanted to walk to most of the major sight seeing areas that was possible. Despite being very busy with work, Barb was always friendly and helpful and obviously enjoys having people to stay. A big thank you to her for having us.
Robyn"
4974,757320,13655196,2014-06-02,5520848,Christian,Barb is very pleasant. the room is well situated (closed to underground and bus station)  and calm. We recommanded this adress.
4975,757320,14077435,2014-06-11,13205787,Tami,Barb was very welcoming and friendly! We had an appropriate amount of privacy and full use of the kitchen. The location was perfect: easy walk to gamla stan and also the rest of stockholm. The only downside is that the window faces a busy street so if you are a light sleeper bring ear plugs. Definitely recommend!
4976,757320,14392056,2014-06-18,13946158,Markus,"Die Lage der Wohnung ist genial: kurze Wege ins Stadtzentrum, netter und lebendiger Stadtteil, gute Kneipen, gute Einkaufsmöglichkeiten incl. Lebensmittel.
Barb ist eine sehr sympathische, freundliche und hilfsbereite Gastgeberin. Sie gibt Tipps zur Stadt und nimmt sich Zeit für Gespräche. 
Das Zimmer in Barbs Wohnung ist sehr gepflegt und sauber. Die Mitbenutzung des Badezimmers und der Küche war kein Problem. Das Zimmer ist sehr ruhig - von der Straße war kaum Lärm zu hören. 
Die Wohnung liegt im 6. Stock und ist mit einem Aufzug gut erreichbar. 
Uns hat es sehr gut gefallen und wir können die Wohnung ohne Einschränkung weiterempfehlen. "
4977,757320,15034286,2014-07-01,12997807,Renee,"Barb was very friendly, even when we arrived with a late flight! The apartment was clean and we could use her facilities like the bathroom and the kitchen. We expected that our private room would be bigger, but it was okay. The location was really perfect, a lot of places to eat, drink, shop and 2 supermarkets close to the apartment."
4978,757320,15905022,2014-07-18,10520872,Brigitte,"Barb war eine freundliche Gastgeberin.
Das Zimmer ist zentral gelegen, alles ist von dort aus gut zu erreichen.
Es gab Zugang zur Küche und ein Fach im Kühlschrank um das Frühstück herzurichten.
Der Raum war sauber und zweckmäßig eingerichtet, jedoch sehr laut, da er zur Hauptstraße hin gelegen ist. 
Um Stockholm zu erkunden ein guter Standort."
4979,757320,16202350,2014-07-23,80513,Lars,"The apartment of Barbara is on Södermalm, maybe a ten minute walk from Gamla Stan and the trendy parts of Södermalm (like Sofo) and some nice cafes around.
It is big and clean (as the room and the shared bathroom are). The room itself is big enough for two,
has a wardrobe, two chairs and a small table and a window, but it´s facing the main street, so it´s noisy (if you open the window), you should be aware of that. Barbara was easy to handle with, always friendly and mostly in the background. If you´re looking for a cheap option in a good (and safe) neighbourhood and you´re ok with some street noise (with open windows) you can go there."
4980,757320,16429487,2014-07-27,17988101,Jens,"Barb was a very welcoming, pleasant and helpful hostess. Stockholm was the last stop of our trip through Sweden and as we travelled by car we had a challenge to park the car for 3 days without a fee because all parking places has to be paid in the city. Fortunately Barb was so kind and helpful and organised for us a parking place from a neighbour in the building. Thanks again!! Her apartment and the bedroom is clean and tidy with comfortable beds and we could also use her kitchen with our own space inside the fridge. The bathroom is opposite the bedroom. Her apartment is perfect located as it is close to the Metro station which is reachable by a 5 minutes walk. Alternatively you could also walk to Gamla Stan or the city centre to discover Stockholm.

My daughter and me we would definitely stay again in Barb's apartment. "

She welcomed us with fresh cold water and towels in our room and gave us some nice suggestions for places to see close to the house. She really cared about us and suprised my friend one morning in our room, while I was taking a shower."

The neighborhood is near from restaurants and shops and there is Manu bus to get to the city center easily .
I would recommand this place !"

The neighbourhood is adorable, with lots of spots to feel a sweedish experience, living in a beautiful but non ultra-touristic place.

Highly recommendable! I'll back sure! :)"
4985,757320,18961981,2014-09-03,17277933,Anna,"Barbs Wohnung liegt direkt auf Södermalm, mit sehr guten Ubahn- Verbindungen und Einkaufsmöglichkeiten. Das Zimmer ist nicht ganz leise, da es direkt an einer relativ großen Strasse liegt, der Lärmpegel nachts ist aber gut erträglich. Wir kamen etwas zu spät an, da unser Zug aufgrund einer Bombendrohung in Stockholm (kein Witz!) öfters liegenblieb. Barb war not amused, anscheinend hatte sie Probleme unsere Sms zu verstehen bzw. zu empfangen (Tipp: Immer anrufen). Im Anschluss daran, versuchte Sie die etwas gedrückte Stimmung aufzulockern, was allerdings durch das Aufstellen einiger sehr bestimmte Wohnungsregeln nur teilweise gelang. Barb ist für Ihr Alter durchaus flexibel, hat aber ihre Eigenheiten. Ansonsten hatten wir während der drei Tage keinen Grund zu klagen, die Wohnung ist wie gesagt sehr hübsch gelegen. Am Abend vor unserer Abreise teilte Sie uns allerdings mit, dass Sie es vorziehen würde wenn wir am nächsten Tag möglichst früh (ca. 9. Uhr) weiterzeihen würden, was wir dann auch gerne taten. 
Alles in Allem war es ok, wir hatten einen etwas frostigen Start mit ihr, aber insgesamt können wir Barb weiterempfehlen (vor allem an Leute Mitte 30 aufwärts).

4986,757320,19284115,2014-09-09,19403893,Elizabeth,Barb was great host Andre even enjoyed a lively dinner with her one night.  Her apartment was in a great part of the city.

Handdoeken en een kan met water stond klaar voor ons. Ze boodt nog aan thee te maken maar dat hoefden we niet. Het bed was groot en sliep heerlijk. Barb had ook nog een stapel flyers van attracties in de stad voor ons klaar gelegd. Haar appartement ligt heel erg centraal in een super leuke wijk. Van daaruit kun je makkelijk overal heen lopen. Barb is erg vriendelijk en rustig. Af en toe maakten we een praatje. We mochten overal gebruik van maken en er werd zelfs ruimte gemaakt in de koelkast voor ons. De enige pech voor ons was dat de lift gemaakt werd gedurende ons verblijf en we iedere keer 6 verdiepingen met de trap moesten. 
We raden Barb zeker aan!"

Está muy bien ubicado en sodermalm, la pieza era cómoda y limpia, y ella tuvo muy buena disposición y fue muy agradable. El ascensor estaba en reparaciones, pero los arreglos iban a estar terminados muy luego.
Me parece que es un muy buen lugar para quedarse, especialmente considerando la excelente ubicación del departamento. "

The room itself is large, warm and comfortable. We had access to the lounge and kitchen but spent all our time out so didn't utilise these facilities. Barb made us breakfast on our last morning and had interesting stories to tell. We also loved her daughter's dog Dolly. "

The room came with everything that I needed, which made packing very easy. It is located in a neighborhood with plenty of grocery stores, shops, and coffee shops to wander through. It is only two blocks away from the subway station. The trains come very often and you'll be minutes away from almost anything. "

Apartment is very close to the underground, only 3 stops to the old town. Did not walk around the local area as I only had 2 days.
If you are a light sleeper or like a dark room, bring an eye mask and ear plugs. The street noise can be a bit loud, nothing my eye mask and ear plugs couldn't fix and shouldn't stop you from staying."

Seul petit bémol : rue un peu bruyante malgré le 6ème étage mais le double vitrage fait très bien son travail !!
Nous recommandons sans réserve ce logement."
5013,757320,44414054,2015-08-26,10894942,Alberto,Barb is a sweet host. We felt at home. Her house is very clean and welcoming. She was kind to us. We recommend her apartment to stay in Stockholm
5014,757320,44807769,2015-08-29,40144928,Maren,"Barb is a very nice host and you will have a nice, cosy and clean room and bathroom. The area is perfect if you want to visit Stockholms young and trendy Södermalm but everything around gamla stan is also in walkable distance. We would visit Barb again if we come back to Stockholm!"
5015,757320,45287174,2015-09-01,39994185,Noujoud,"The room was clean and as the pictures show.
There was only a problem when we arrived. Because some friends showed me the neighbourhood and walked me to Barb’s house, Barb got disturbed and did not provide the key to the appartement. Wich is a pity because I had to text everytime I was going back to the room ! Too bad that I had to give her all my official documents in order to reassure her that I and my friend are not a risk for her. Anyways, it could have stopped at this, but she told me that she had to call the police, which is not a problem for me because i felt secured.
After this little problem, barb was polite and offered us tea and coffee and she let us use the kitchen."
5016,757320,45674329,2015-09-05,21230866,Catherine,"We had a lovely stay at Barb's place in Sodermalm. The location is perfect with lots of cafes, restaurants, bars around. Barb was a helpful host and made us feel at home very quickly. "
5017,757320,47407137,2015-09-18,43349059,Anders,Hur bra som helst. Väldigt tillmötesgående och rum och toa var rent och fräscht. Kan absolut tänka mig att bo där igen.
5018,757320,48750296,2015-09-28,42936215,Hanna,"Barb was so friendly and fun!! My sister and I stayed with her in Stockholm our first part of our trip and she made our experience the best! She would make us soup, dessert and coffee! Such a great host and so generous! Made us feel right at home and everything was extremely clean! Loved the room, bathroom and adorable flat! Will definitely stay with Barb if we return and highly recommend her to anyone traveling! She's hilarious! We love you Barb and can't forget precious Dolly (her daughters tiny dog)!! Xoxo"
5019,757320,49527667,2015-10-04,1861892,Evelyn,"Thanks to Barb's ultra comfy room in the trendiest area of the city, we've enjoyed Stockholm to the most! The bed is so comfortable that we had hard time getting up early. Every main sightseeing, shopping district, ""it"" restaurants are within few minutes walk (or simply downstairs!). Barb is such a friendly and relaxed host who really made us feel at ease. Thank you so much Barb, we'll surely come back and hopefully to your place again! :)  Wish you all the best!"
5020,757320,49920051,2015-10-07,42789015,Felicitas,"A friend and I stayed at Barb's home for 3 nights and we felt really comfortable! The room is nice, you have a bathroom almost of your own and the bed is very cushy. Barb is a friendly host, it was nice to talk to her but she also leaves you on your own.
The neighbourhood is perfect for shopping and exploring Stockholm by foot, like Gamla Stan is in 10 minutes walking distance.
So we had a great stay and would recommend Barb's appartment! :)"
5021,757320,50240171,2015-10-10,4266538,Angel,"I really appriciate our decision to choose Bart's apartment and we had a really warm and cherished moment with her!
Location is super great and 10 minutes walk to the wonderful old town. Subways and buses 5 minutes walk to easily access. Her house is clean and beautiful, and Bart was so kind to make Taco for us, so nice and we miss her so much. We love Stockholm, and one of the main reason is we met Bart:)   "
5022,757320,50811725,2015-10-14,34354886,Matteo,Great location and perfect apartment! We've found exactly what we needed for a weekend visit in Stockholm. Barb was really nice and helpful (she gave us a lot of suggestions for restaurants)! Hope to see you soon Barb!
5023,757320,52342212,2015-10-28,15857108,Ariane,"Barb est très accueillante et son accueil était chaleureux. L'appartement est très bien situé: proche du métro et à 15 minutes à pieds seulement du centre ville. Le quartier de l'appartement est très agréable, il y a des restaurants et le quartier est joli à visiter. Le seul bémol serait peut-être le manque d'espace dans l'appartement (seulement une petite chambre) et le partage de la salle de bain. Mais l'ensemble reste très confortable et agréable. "
5024,757320,56642011,2015-12-15,50833192,Eva,"Barb's apartment is perfectly located in charming Södermalm which is a very hip and cool neighborhood full of nice bars, shops and happy people. The apartment is on the 6th floor near to Mariatorget, where you have the metro. The place is just a few steps from the shopping street of Södermalm and then the charming old town. 
We stayed in Stockholm over the weekend, exploring the beautiful city. We only needed a room to sleep in so Barb's place was very nice for that matter. Very comfy bed, clean sheets, big window and a shower, practically all we needed. The internet unfortunately didn't work for us.  
Barb was nice and welcoming person. "
5025,757320,59150875,2016-01-07,51430046,Pascale,"This is a very nice room in an apartment in the hip Södermalm area of Stockholm. We enjoyes Barb's hospitality. She gave us all the privacy we needed, while at the same time being open and warm towards us. Barb even prepared a special breakfast for us to get to know the Swedish cuisine a little better. That was a very nice experience. It really felt as if we were visiting a distant aunt. All together a great stay."
5026,757320,61781339,2016-02-08,26427068,Megan,"Great location. Great bedroom. Barb left us a pitcher of water with sliced lemon, a variety of fruit to eat, she made us espresso, and provided us with instant coffee for the mornings. This is a perfect apartment for people who need a place to sleep and shower before spending the day sight seeing."
5027,757320,62392532,2016-02-14,55047547,Tracy,"Lovely!  Barb was such a wonderful hostess--very prompt in replying to the booking, so dear in person and she  included excellent directions to get to her flat.  The room is as stated--lovely and quiet and cozy.  The location is great--nearly shopping and coffee and restaurants, and an easy walk to Gamla Stan, the tunnelbana, and SoFo shopping neighborhood.

"
5036,757320,74661492,2016-05-16,1006769,Brigita,"We had a really nice stay at Barbros flat. It was the perfect location. The train station is close to the apartment. Everything we needed was very close. Cafe´s, supermarkets and shops when you stept out the door. Barbro was the perfect host. She was really friendly and let us feel comfortable."
5037,757320,76488887,2016-05-27,28619995,Lola,Lovely appartment with a very confortable bed and a large bathroom. It is also has an excellent location. The neighbourhood is full of bars and restaurants. Barb made me feel at home and was always asking me if I needed anything. Without no doubt I would recommend staying at Barb's.
5038,757320,77959523,2016-06-04,35700887,Michèle,"Bien reçus par Barb qui a tout fait pour que nous nous sentions comme à la maison.
La chambre est coquette, l'armoire assez grande pour un séjour même d'une semaine.
Elle laisse la salle de bains à disposition toute la journée, ne s'en servant que le matin de bonne heure et en toute discrétion, nous ne l'avons jamais entendue....
L'appartement est très bien situé, aucun problème pour aller à pied à Gamla Stan et à l'embarcadère de Slussen.
Merci Barb pour votre souriant accueil .

5040,757320,79173815,2016-06-11,71823556,Nigel,"I did not stay with Barb myself but my parents had a wonderful time. Her apartment is in a nice location close to the metro. She was kind and welcomed us when we arrived. The room was not huge but spacious enough for two older individuals to move with ease. My parents said they enjoyed the room and the amenities included. The only concern that my parents felt was that her room does not have black-out curtains. So going to sleep early or waking up late was complicated by the northern sun hours. Overall, amazing place. "
5041,757320,80795040,2016-06-19,40602792,Martina,"Staying at Barb's apartment was wonderful. The location is in a lovely part of Södermalm and is very simple to get to from Central Station. It is also a short walk to Gamla Stan, as well as many other attractions. Barb was great, very sweet, accommodating, and very helpful. I would certainly stay with her again the next time I'm in Stockholm. :) "
5042,757320,82118885,2016-06-26,30889253,Paul,"We had a great time in Stockholm and at Barb's place. The room is comfortable and Barb is a very discrete and helpful host. The location in Södermalm is great, offering many facilities nearby (shopping, public transport, city bikes, etc.). We also enjoyed the fast internet access. As the room is not darkened overnight, do not forget to bring along sleeping masks, especially during summertime. For the rest I recommend the location without hesitation."
5043,757320,85478750,2016-07-11,33266831,Elsa,"The room is cosy and you will easily find the flat 5min away from the metro. Barb is very nice, she gave us precious advices for our stay at Stockholm. We had access to shared bathroom and kitchen any time we needed. I totally recommend this place."
5044,757320,87407976,2016-07-20,12327058,Sanne,"Clean bedroom and bathroom in Sodermalm, Stockholm. Sodermalm is a very nice and hip area. The apartement is close to Metro stop Mariotorget. Barb was a friendly host. "
5045,757320,88948915,2016-07-26,24369429,Jessie,"I would definitely recommend Barb's lovely room! The space was clean and comfortable, and Barb made the arrival process very easy. She was a friendly and helpful host! I also loved the location - lots of places to eat, two minutes from public transportation, and easily walkable to all places in central Stockholm."
5046,757320,89447453,2016-07-28,59282417,Trude,"Stedet har en flott beliggenhet sentralt i Stockholm, hvor vi spesielt likte gangavstand til severdigheter, spisesteder, metro og bysykler. Verten misforstod vårt ankomsttidspunkt og viste liten forståelse for vår forsinkede ankomst til Stockholm. Dette ga oss til å begynne med en følelse av å ikke være særlig velkomne. Oppholdet de påfølgende dagene var derimot upåklagelige, og vi vil anbefale stedet videre.  "
5047,757320,92113069,2016-08-07,36432020,Rebecca,"Barb's place is great! It's located close to Gamla Stan and several metro stations. It's a reasonable walk to other great sites like the Vasa Museum and the public library. The bed was super comfy and Barb is a very gracious and welcoming host. She has lots of recommendations for things to see and do. Her place is located on a busy street so it's not the best for folks who don't like noise, but that didn't bother me at all. I would definitely stay with Barb again!"

5050,757320,97995654,2016-08-29,15313517,Giulia,Barb is really kind and willing. She waited for us even if our plane landed really late. The room was so cute and clean. I deeply recommend this apartment also for its central position.
5051,757320,100104565,2016-09-07,5524735,Michelle,"Spacious, bright and clean room in an excellent location - in the very hip area of sodermalm, close to trendy cafes, restaurants, bars and shops and within walking distance to major attractions.

5053,757320,102829886,2016-09-19,49258599,Izabella,"Overall we had a bad experience at Barb's house. Before our arrival she was really confused and quite rude to give us directions about her house and when we arrived (it was quite late but we had told her the time of our arrival when we booked the room) she seemed really unhappy to receive us. The other day we asked her if we could use the kitchen as it was announced and her answer was ""a little bit"". Moreover, the wifi did not work really well and the room was quite noisy during the night if the windows weren't shut, since the apartment is located in a big avenue. 
To be entirely fair, she warmed up to us towards the end of our stay. Despite all these facts, the room was clean and the bathroom was good. "
5054,757320,103402872,2016-09-22,46828838,Jieun,Good location and a nice place to stay when you visit Stockholm. Highly recommendable.
5055,757320,104026638,2016-09-25,60322644,Mayumi,"I had a great time in her place. The place is really convenient to go everywhere because it is very close to subway station, to Slussun and  to places in city center. She was so kind and helped me a lot. "
5056,757320,106040489,2016-10-03,17993538,David,"Barb is very friendly and welcoming - she even waited for us until late in the night as our flight was delayed. The room is nice and the Location is just perfect. Metro Station, cafes and restaurants are in 2-3 min walking distance. We can highly recommend it for a sightseeing trip to Stockholm. Thank you, Barb!"
5057,757320,109210334,2016-10-20,18064844,Ly,"You really couldn't ask for a better location- a lovely 20 minute walk to the cute (but more touristy!) old town in Gamla Stan...but close to nice shops, cafes, and grocery stores if you don't feel like venturing too far. The room is cozy and clean, nice old-fashioned decor, and a big bathroom. Barb was super kind- she gave us our space, but we had a great conversations too about our cultures and she even made us tasty beet soup one night :)"
5058,757320,110779211,2016-10-28,10963435,Mountains,A very comfortable place with a big bathroom and well located near the old town and subway station. Barb is a nice host..

5064,757320,120160365,2016-12-08,2016505,Flor,"Barb's house is a great place to stay!
It is in my favourite neighborhood of Stockholm, Södermalm, an area with a lots of design stores, second hand shops and cool bar and restaurants.
It is very centric, you can walk to everywhere and you have different super markets.
The house is big and the room is cozy and clean :)
Barb is a wonderful host! 
She sent me all the information to get to her house and she was very polite. When we arrived she offered also a piece of cake :)
I really recommend to stay at her house !

Her flat is well located just a few minutes away from the metro on a busy street where you can find supermarkets, lovely cafés and restaurants. We are only a few minutes walking distance from the Old town. The room was great and the bed very comfortable especially after long days exploring Stockholm. 

Barb was very kind and helpful, she left some water and fruits in our room as a welcoming present we really appreciated it. On our last day she also gave us some of the traditional Xmas Swedish pastry."

5069,757320,129631710,2017-02-01,1966650,Grace,"Barb's place is located in the lively and eclectic part of Stockholm — Sodermalm. You can find lots of nice restaurants at a reasonable price in the area.

One of the free walking tour —Soder Tour—is also within the same area. Starting point of the tour is just 10min walk away from Barb's place. A massive supermarket is only 5min walk away from her place. 

Barb is a very warm and friendly person. Everything was perfect at her apartment except you can't do laundry there because the laundry service is only available for private use, not for guests in the building. "
5070,757320,130897534,2017-02-09,114342989,Clara,Lovely appartement with lovely host! The appartment is located in the heart of Södermalm and close to the city centre as well as to public transport

5074,757320,147169573,2017-04-25,57032928,Martina,"Siamo stati da Barb durante il ponte del 25 aprile. La posizione è buona, a circa 10 minuti di passeggiata da Gamla Stan, l'isola centrale di Stoccolma. Metro a neanche 5 minuti. La stanza è calda ed accogliente, il bagno pulito, c'è una vasca doccia, un lavandino, niente bidet. Abbiamo solo dormito, non abbiamo fatto colazione o pasti da lei, quindi non sappiamo come si regoli. Palazzina tranquilla, Sesto piano con ascensore. Il costo puo' sembrare alto ma Stoccolma è molto molto costosa, quindi va messo in proporzione. Host e città consigliati (anche se è meglio andare d'estate, durante il nostro Soggiorno ha nevicato parecchio) . "

5076,757320,150475012,2017-05-08,28876718,Jasmin,"Sauberes und ordentliches Zimmer, das zur Hauptstraße liegt. Wer es abends lieber ruhiger mag, muss das Fenster schließen. Die Lage hat aber auch viele Vorteile, da Restaurants, Cafés und Einkaufsmöglichkeiten direkt vor der Tür liegen. In die Altstadt sind es zu Fuß 15 Minuten. Generell liegt das Zimmer sehr zentral, auch nach SoFo nur etwa 15 Gehminuten. Barb ist sehr gastfreundlich und hilfsbereit und hat jederzeit einige Tipps parat. Sie hat eine lockere Einstellung und bringt dir als Gast sehr viel Vertrauen entgegen. Badezimmer und Küche können genutzt werden, morgens kann man sich auch mal einen Kaffee oder Tee machen. Wir würden wiederkommen."

5080,757320,158698741,2017-06-08,40501658,Chelsie,"Barb's apartment is in a great, central area, and it isn't noisy when you're trying to get to sleep. The apartment is very nice and has a well-stocked kitchen, which is not something you get everywhere. Barb was very kind -- she even ironed my clothes for me and my sister, which was far beyond what I would expect. She also gave us some bread she baked and some sweets. It was like staying with family. We would definitely stay there again."
5081,757320,160189317,2017-06-13,62604083,Benedikt,"Barb ist sehr nett und unkompliziert. Das Zimmer ist groß genug und sauber, ebenso das Badezimmer, Mitbenutzung der Küche und des Kühlschranks war kein Problem. 
Die sehr schöne und stilvolle Wohnung liegt perfekt in Södermalm, etwa 15 Minuten fußläufig von Gamla Stan. 
Wir haben unseren Aufenthalt in Stockholm sehr genossen. "

5084,757320,168334460,2017-07-09,26167776,Raphael,"Barb was a wonderful host, very helpful and nice. 
The location of the apartment is very close to the central area of the city. It's just a 10mins walk to old town. 
Bed and bathroom were clean and totally suffient. The room was a little bit light and you could hear some noise from the street, but we didn't have a huge problem with that. I guess only people that are sensible might have some issues with that. 
We felt very comfortable all the time and Barb was also providing us some leftovers for breakfast. 
We had a nice time, thanks again Barb! "
5085,757320,169268276,2017-07-12,33285664,Charlee,"Barb was lovely. I would recommend her place to anyone. Located in a very good part of town with great shops and restaurants. Walking distance to old town
And awesome attractions. Barb was very helpful in assisting us with our day plans and activities. "
5086,757320,171366847,2017-07-17,129059398,Tatiana,"Staying at Barb's place was a good experience overall. The room was clean and comfy, while providing an adequate amount of privacy. The location of the apartment itself was ideal, right on the north end of Sodermaln (quite close to Gamla Stan and T-Centralen). The area around the apartment has a wide variety of restaurants and grocery stores as well. There were some issues with miscommunication that occurred, but were easily resolved. Barb is a genuine and kind person who will do her best to ensure a quality stay. "
5087,757320,173398371,2017-07-23,1255408,Yin,"Barb's place is very neat , beautiful decorations and easier to go to everywhere. She is very friendly and give us great advice for the city. It can be accessed via train station Mariatorget, Slussen or Stockholm sodra. We have took commuter's train 18 from/to airport and stopped at Stockholm sodra and than walked to the apartment. We can also walk  to Gamla Stan it is just 15 min away. Highly recommended. "
5088,757320,176554280,2017-07-31,21606961,Marcelle,"Barb's communication was excellent with us. She always responded quickly and informed me of important things.
Her place is convenient to all transportation and very safe . The flat was clean and comfy just like the pictures on Airbnb.
There are many good restaurants and pubs close-by. Shopping was great too! 
There is a beautiful park Mariatoget near which is nice to stroll at night.
All tourist activities were easy to get to from Sodermalm location by walking, metro, bus or bike.
 City bike rental at park across street too. it was expensive to take taxi fro Arlanda airport, best to take metro or bus."
5089,757320,177971265,2017-08-04,14764684,Livia,"Barb has been an amazing host! The house is really nice and is located in the city centre, in a beautiful area with shops, restaurants and supermarkets. Barb was always available to give me any kind of information about the city.

The flat is clean and located perfectly close to different metro stations and walking distance to restaurants and shops all over. Only about 10 minute walk to the old Town and to the fotografic museum, which is worth a visit! I'd recommend this flat and Barb as a host any time!"
5091,757320,183353996,2017-08-17,68518708,Valerio,"Siamo stati da Barb per 4 notti, l'appartamento si trova in un'ottima posizione per raggiungere il centro sia a piedi che coi mezzi. Cucina ben organizzata e attrezzata. Barb è stata inoltre molto gentile e flessibile per gli orari di check-in e check-out."
5092,757320,185222004,2017-08-21,131301115,Lara,"Das Zimmer war sauber und schön vorbereitet mit Obst und Wasser. Das Bad war ebenfalls schön sauber und geräumig mit Badewanne.
Die einzige Schwierigkeit war, dass Barb direkt vor der Ankunft lieber über SMS oder Telefon kommunizieren wollte als über Airbnb, während ich kein gutes Telefonnetz hatte sondern nur mobiles Internet. Das hat zu ein paar unvollständigen Informationen geführt. Am Ende hat aber doch alles geklappt."

5095,757320,192796691,2017-09-11,20951016,Cameron,"Barb was a wonderful host. She gave us clear instructions about how to get to the apartment and was waiting to open up when we arrived. The room is comfortable and well located in Sodermalm, close to Maria Torget metro. Barb even gave us fruit during our stay. Good value"
5096,757320,194646503,2017-09-17,47523767,Priya,"The Brewery Conference Centre is around the corner from the apartment - 5 minute walk.  Perfect place to stay when attending conferences and then go on to walk around the city.  It's a Bohemian part of the city with great places to eat.  In front of the apartment is Falafelbaren, the side street on which the room faces has the Tehran Grill-great places to eat.  A great coffee house past the metro at Johan & Nystrom.  Lots of shops for groceries and 2 mins from the metro.  Though I hardly used it.  You can walk everywhere.  Even though situated on a busy road, I slept peacefully on all nights. Comfortable room and facilities. A good price in Stockholm in an ideal location."

The appartment is near to metro ( 3 minutes walk) and we had our own bathroom."

En mi caso obtuve un recibimiento muy poco amigable de parte de Barb ( estuve esperando 20 minutos en la puerta, a pesar de que ella estaba en el departamento ). Aparte de eso, el resto fue bien, silencioso y sin problemas."
5119,757320,282057571,2018-06-26,7021652,Kenny,Barb's place is super cozy and very well located. Barb welcomed us generously and gave us the time to check-out as she had no other guests coming.

The host was willing to share her stories to us. She was happy in the morning, but sometimes sad at night. She better be more polite to the guests and not to shout at us."
5128,757320,499205359,2019-07-31,129395241,Joshua,"Der Raum ist sehr klein. Die Koffer unterzubringen war schwer. Die Tür lässt sich nicht abschließen! Obwohl dies im Profil angegeben ist. 

Die Badezimmertür hat nur einen kleinen Mini-Haken zum ""Abschließen"". Das Wasser der Dusche wird (nach Angabe von Barb) erst nach minutenlangem Laufen warm. 5 Minuten reichen wohl nicht, denn danach war das Wasser bei uns noch eiskalt und wir hatten aufgegeben.

Kommunikation lief ziemlich schlecht und zeitverzögert. Pünktlichkeit oder Absprachen-Einhalten war nicht ihre Stärke. 

Die Waschmaschine möchte sie eigentlich ungern benutzt haben, obwohl diese auch als Inventar angegeben war. Wir durften dann doch waschen, doch war sie sichtlich irritiert davon. 

Nach erstem Unbehagen hatten wir allerdings schon das Gefühl, dass sie sich bemühen wollte freundlich zu sein, doch haben wir sie buchstäblich nur für den sehr verspäteten Check-in und am nächsten Morgen gesehen. Danach war sie unterwegs und wieder schlecht zu erreichen."

5131,757320,515488579,2019-08-23,231945643,Lisa,"We really liked to stay at Barb‘s apartment. The location is perfect (close to the old town and in the center of Södermalm which is a very cool part of town). The room was cosy and clean and Barb is a very friendly host. The thing we didn‘t like was that she wanted to communicate by SMS which distegards the Airbnb rules. Communication only worked when using SMS, otherwise we didn’t get a response. But still we enjoyed our stay very much!"
5132,757320,520436020,2019-08-30,20398301,Cesar,"El piso de Barb se encuentra en un barrio a unos 15 minutos caminando del casco antiguo de Estocolmo. 
Está en una calle muy concurrida que, aunque parece segura, resulta  muy bulliciosa y con tráfico continuo las 24 horas.
En el piso puedes hacer uso de la cocina y del baño.
La habitación no es muy espaciosa aunque suficiente para pasar un par de días.
Aunque la ventana no da a la calle principal si se escucha bastante el tráfico, lo que sumado a la claridad por falta de cortinas opacas y a un colchón muy blando no facilita un buen descanso.
El trato con Barb empezó siendo correcto pero  al segundo día tuvimos un desencuentro bastante desagradable que nunca habíamos tenido con ningún anfitrión.
Al llegar al piso nos pidió que cerraramos con llave la puerta cuando salieramos de casa. Pero en una ocasión, estando ella dentro, no lo hicimos precisamente porque nos pareció violento encerrar a una persona dentro.
Esto provocó en ella una enfado desproporcionado en el que mostró su caracter inestable y unos modos muy poco apropiados.
Exigiéndonos, como nueva norma, que la avisáramos cada vez que entrábamos o salíamos de la casa; algo que acostumbramos a hacer por educación pero no por obligación.
Por otra parte, aunque para nosotros no fué un problema, no nos pareció bien que conviviese con un perro y no lo comunicase en las características de la vivienda.
Nuestra experiencia en la casa fué tan desagradable que llegó a afectar nuestras vacaciones en Estocolmo incluso cuando estábamos fuera de la casa.
Por estos motivos, por supuesto NO repetiríamos, y NO recomendamos este alojamiento.


Barb's apartment is located in a neighborhood about 15 minutes walk from Stockholm's old town.
It is in a very busy street that, although it seems safe, is very noisy and with 24-hour continuous traffic.
On the floor you can make use of the kitchen and bathroom.
The room is not very spacious but enough to spend a couple of days.
Although the window does not face the main street you hear enough traffic, which added to the clarity due to lack of blackout curtains and a very soft mattress does not facilitate a good rest.
The deal with Barb began to be correct but on the second day we had a rather unpleasant disagreement that we had never had with any host.
Upon arriving at the apartment she asked us to lock the door when we left home. But on one occasion, while she was inside, we didn't do it precisely because we found it violent to lock a person inside.
This caused in her a disproportionate anger in which she showed her unstable character and very inappropriate ways.
Requiring us, as a new rule, to let her know each time we entered or left the house; something we used to do for education but not for obligation.
On the other hand, although it was not a problem for us, it did not seem right for us to live with a dog and not communicate it in the characteristics of the house.
Our experience at home was so unpleasant that it affected our vacation in Stockholm even when we were away from home.
For these reasons, of course we would NOT repeat, and we DO NOT recommend this accommodation."
5133,757320,523228484,2019-09-03,139715900,Xavier,"The location of the apartment is really great, train very close and 10-15mn walk from Gamla Stan and the center.

The apartment was new and very spacious, also for 4 persons and it was perfectly cleaned and prepared when we arrived. Everything you need (supermarket, bars, restaurants, underground) is very close to the apartment and the city center is just a few minutes away by tube. Gabriella offered her help and assistance at any time and was very flexible with arriving and departure times. I highly recommend this nice place and also Grabriella as a host. "

The flat was clean, very comfortable as it had a large living room with kitchen which we enjoyed relaxing after a long day of site seeing,  2  double bedrooms for myself and friends to stay and a very cute balcony which was handy due to some of us being smokers. 
The flat is beautifully decorated and feel her pictures don't do the size of the place justice as it was a lot bigger than I was expecting. The place had wifi which defiantly came in handy plus fresh Linen and towels.  Gabriella was a very welcoming host and we would defiantly stay here again and highly recommend it to others. Thanks Gabriella :) "

The pictures do not do this amazing apartment justice--it is very large and modern with every comfort of home including an induction cooktop, dishwasher, washing machine, and heated tile floors in the bathroom.  The apartment is conveniently located near great restaurants, grocery stores, and shopping, and just steps away from the subway and buses that will take you to anywhere in Stockholm.  Gabriella thoughtfully filled her fridge with breakfast essentials knowing that my jetlagged children would likely wake up hungry in the middle of the night.  She also left toys for my children to play with.  We could not be more pleased with the entire experience.  "

Bus and metro only about 100 meters away with very good connections anywhere in the city, it is easy to get around. There are also surprisingly good restaurants within a couple minutes of walk. Gabriella gave us generous tips about sights, activities and other practicalities. Simply outstanding experience! Highly recommended!"

There was free parking on the weekends on the street outside and after we'd gotten settled, Gabriella sent us through heaps of great advice about the area.

There was heaps of great food close by, as well as a subway station and the walk to Gamla Stan wasn't long (actually really nice!).

We would definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone :)"

Man fühlt sich gleich wohl. Dass man in Leinenbettwäsche schlafen kann, es ein niedliches kleines Aquarium in einem der Zimmer und z.B. gleich ums Eck ein entzückendes Café gibt, an dem auch Veganer ihre Freude haben, sind nur ein paar der weiteren Pluspunkte. Man kann ohne Weiteres die Altstadt und alle interessanten Viertel zu Fuß erreichen. Die U-Bahn ist auch nur wenige Fußminuten entfernt. 
Gabriella ist ein wunderbare Gastgeberin, sie hat uns schon im Voraus hervorragende Tipps zu Restaurants, Cafés und Bars gegeben, die Kommunikation war durchgehend sehr angenehm. 
Wir würden jederzeit gerne wieder hier unterkommen. "
5166,763407,9699999,2014-01-06,7079716,Mikhail,"Our family had wonderful vacation in Stockholm, and a big part of success was an excellent accommodation. Gabriella is a very nice person, we rented her apartment for 3 days, and it was a pleasure to live in it. This flat is realy close to the metro station, the district is very peaceful and nice. The neighbours are extremely quite, and i am not sure, they are enen exist. Inside of the apartment everything is perfect too. It is very cosy, furniture is good and comfortable, you get all the stuff that you need in the kitchen, beds are very good too, and bathroom doesn`t have any problems. 
In other words, if you are going to Stockholm, don`t miss that apartment.
And a big thanks to Gabriella for her hospitality.
Good luck everyone!

Ensuite, Gabriella a été très flexible sur les horaires de check in et check out. En effet, nous avons dû repartir 24h plus tôt car des grèves sur la compagnie aérienne avait annulé notre vol. Cela n'a posé aucun problème pour le check out.

Sur place, c'était très bien:
- l'appartement est très spacieux et très joli. Tout était impeccablement propre et rangé.
- il y avait déjà du chauffage dans la salle de bain pour notre plus grand confort (le chauffage au sol, c'est top)! Des produits cosmétiques à disposition (gel douche, shampooing etc), et de très grandes serviettes de toilette! (bien plus grandes que celles que les hôtels peuvent fournir!!
- à disposition, de quoi faire un petit déjeuner.
- l'appartement est très calme, aucun bruit de l'extérieur ne nous a gêné.

L'appartement est bien situé, tout près de la station de métro Odenplan. Facile d'accès grâce à l'ascenseur.

The location of the apartment was perfect! Lovely neighbourhood with lots of amentities just around the corner and we explored Stockholm on foot from there! 

The apartment itself was even more cosy and lovely than the pictures show! Such a nice place to relax after a long day of exploring the city! Plenty of hot water, comfy beds and blankets. The living room made for a stylish place to hang out.

Wir durften sogar eine Stunde früher als abgemacht einchequen und Gabriela wollte für uns noch Frühstück kaufen. Sehr flexibel und sehr nett.

5218,763407,195136625,2017-09-18,3449255,Ruzanna,"We could not have picked a better place for stay in Stockholm. It was the perfect size for my two kids and my husband and I. The location is perfectly central to everything but on a nice quiet street. There are restaurants and stores and parks very close by and it was very easy to walk out the door and just go. Gabriella's communication, tips and recommendations were spot on and thus, a perfect host when coming to a new city. We would happily stay here again the next time we come into town and highly suggest it to others for a wonderful stay."
5219,763407,221631926,2017-12-27,76874074,Theodora,"Härligt stilren och charmig lägenhet i ett av Stockholms absolut bästa områden! Centralt men lugn läge. Nära till allt, både restauranger, butiker och buss/tbana. Gabriella är en mycket trevlig, flexibel och gästfri värd. Hennes hem känns personligt men samtidigt luftigt med mycket rymd. Det är tydligt att hon är mån om att man ska känna sig välkommen! En mycket bra Airbnb upplevelse:)"

Calme, a 15 min du cœur de la ville à pied et à côté du métro. Idéal pour les familles. Et il y a un petit square juste derrière pour les jeunes enfants. Accueil très agréable, Gabriella fait tout pour que le séjour se passe au mieux et est très réactive. Merci pour tout !"
5222,763407,285637272,2018-07-04,16822360,Kevin,Many probably pic a more hip neighborhood like Sodermalm... but in all honesty I am so happy we stayed here. The place is great and it exudes Scandanavian design in every corner. Gabriella was great to deal with and she did not disappoint on any element of our vacation. We will stay there again.

Buy a Stockholm pass including public transport! Communication with Gabriella went very smoothly, but there were a few problems since she was not the person to welcome us, but a friend of hers."

Nice, quiet place good for resting and for my group (working/conference). It was easy to hook our phones and lap tops up to sound system to play our music. Location very close to the train and easy walk to walk to central station, waterfront, and shopping. Area around apt. also has a lot to offer in terms of restaurants, bars, night life & cafes. Peter went out of his way to make our group feel welcome, including picking me up at the train and even leaving food & drinks for us. When one of us left something in the apt. he let us know immediately so we can go get it. Excellent stay! "

It is in a great situation, a quiet residential area 15 minutes walk from the old city centre.  It is tastefully decorated and incredibly clean, with a fantastically equipped kitchen, and 3 comfortable bedrooms.  Peter supplied an inflatable mattress at short notice to accommodate an extra guest we had for one night.  There are supermarkets and many restaurants around the corner.  The metro is close by, and the central station (20 minutes on train from Arlanda airport) is only 10 minutes walk away.  Peter met us in person, and gave us helpful advice on the flat, local area, and Stockhom.  He was very flexible on check-in and check-out times to accommcdate our travel arrangements.  Highly recommended!"

Peter's place is in a residential neighborhood just a short walk from the city center, so we were close to pretty much everything. There was even a cool local grocery store right across the street, with others within a few blocks. The apartment was very stylish and clean, and overall a great place to rest and sleep after long days walking around Stockholm. Peter was very communicative, and gave us tips on finding  a cab from the airport to his place, where he met with us to show us around. He also had tips on local restaurants and things to do as well. Check-out was easy, and Peter called to make sure we had a great stay!"

Son appartement est très beau, chaleureux, facile d'accès  et idéalement placé près d'une station de métro ou de lignes de bus . Peter nous a réservé un excellent accueil et a su nous donner les bonnes adresses utiles du quartier ( commerces et restaurant). Nous avons passé un très bon moment chez lui. Le seul petit point négatif que nous aimerions signaler , est la moins bonne qualité du 3ème couchage en canapé lit par rapport aux deux autres lits qui sont des plus confortables. Les nuits ont été plus difficiles pour les amis qui y ont dormi. 
Nous recommandons malgré tout cette très bonne adresse."

5242,776012,38459453,2015-07-15,588038,Jerrod,"As a first timer to Sweden, I could not have picked a better place to stay. The location and the coziness of Majken's place was perfect. The room is on the top floor which provided amazing views and the layout of the flat was very accomodating for two people. Majken and her boyfriend made sure that all questions were answered, everything was running smoothly, and made suggestions of things to do in the area. I highly recommend this flat - an incredible location and flat is paired with a wonderful Airbnb host! "

Majken and Emil are perfect hosts making us feel welcome right away. They are warm, caring and have lots of humor. The apartment is wonderful, still bursting with history in the old part of Gamla Stan. It is the perfect place to start discovering beautiful Stockholm. We can recommend it!"

During the time spent at the apartment we felt a little bit like trendy ""Stockholmers"" :) The location is unbeatable, it is really easy to walk either north or south from it and it is fantastic for evening walks in the old city. The views and light are also really special. 

Overall, I would strongly recommend Majken's lovely apartment and warm welcoming. 
"
5245,776012,41794018,2015-08-09,8094088,Eve,"Majken was a great host and responded very fast to our inquiries. The apartment is charming and ideally located in the old town. The view on Stockholm and the roof tops is stunning. It should be said that the apartment is at the 4th floor and there is no elevator, but it's well worth the effort!  We strongly recommend it and would come back."
5246,776012,42436167,2015-08-13,17080517,Will,"Majken met us in the old town square and showed us up to her gorgeous apartment. She was really easy to deal with before we arrived, always responding to messages quickly and really flexible about our arrival. All in all, excellent. "
5247,776012,45299914,2015-09-01,9067379,Yuval,"Majken's apartment is absolutely amazing!
It is in the heart of the old quarter of Stockholm (Gamlastan), in a quiet picturesque street. The apartment has a cosy atmosphere very warm and welcoming. I felt at home right away and the more I stayed the more I loved it. It has been a true unique and great experience for me to live there for a short while. The view from the windows is also really beautiful view on the rooftops of the old city and beyond. The apartment was fully equipped and met all my needs.
I truly recommend this apartment to anyone wanting to experience living in Stockholm's old quarter in an old yet super-convenient and comfortable apartment. It's a true - one of a kind. You couldn't ask for a more authentic Stockholm living experience.
Since it's located in the heart of Stockholm, you have many restaurants, supermarkets, metro station, all in a very short walking distance. Also, the most beautiful attractions of Stockholm are just minutes away.
Majken and her boyfriend were super friendly and welcomed me when I arrived and have been very flexible and helpful throughout my stay.
Thank you so much Majken and I hope to come back again to your apartment when I'm back in town. It has been one of my most successful Airbnb experiences :-)"

The location could not have been better, the view of the roof tops was interesting the hosts (Majken and Emil) very helpful.  The check in was easy and their place is very well equipped.  It is great for two people.

Literally 200 m from the Nobel Museum, close to the Gamla Stan metro stop and on a very historic street (circa 13 century), it cannot be beat.  We hope to stay again!"

Thank you again !"
5251,776012,74437530,2016-05-15,2495327,Jude,Great location in the Old part of Stockholm. Really near a metro and in walking distance to many of the key sites. It was a great base for our recent trip and we would stay here again.  The steep stairs didn't affect us at all but might for others. Comfortable bed and great hosts who left goodies for us in the kitchen. 
5252,776012,84487204,2016-07-07,27199733,Brian,I stayed in Majken's place for 4 nights in July. The apartment is a lovely cozy one bed at the top of an old building.

Despite the fact that our arriving flight  was delayed by five hours the host made sure that the key exchange was easy and efficient. The apartment is located in a great location for a first time visitor to Stockholm who wants to be based in the medieval city. We found that we could walk to most of the tourist sites. The apartment is clean and functional. On our day of departure we were able to walk to the Central Train Station in less than 15 minutes. We will highly recommend this ideally located apartment to our family and friends.

Majken made check-in and check-out effortless and gave us a long list of tasty restaurant recommendations."

Internet was fast too and romantic location with nice views.  Wonderful stay! "
5264,776012,168787737,2017-07-10,11919978,Angela,Charming and cozy top floor apartment with beautiful views in a historic building on a cobblestone street. We were very relaxed our entire stay. Perfectly romantic.

Il a du cachet, tout comme l'immeuble dans lequel il est situé. Il est au quatrième étage sans ascenseur, c'est à considérer pour les personnes d'une santé fragile. L'appartement est un vrai logement occupé par sa propriétaire une bonne partie de l'année, c'est un point positif supplémentaire."

I would definitely recommend staying here (2 people max). Great trip!"

5272,776012,278047577,2018-06-17,7316404,Francois,"My wife and I spent a week in Majken's apartment, and the first thing we noticed was that is was very clean and tidy. Is is a climb up the stairs but if you are looking for a location in Gamla Stan for 2 people it could not be better: just off the busy commercial streets (nice and quiet in the apartment) but right in the center of things. Five minute walk to the metro station and to a couple of grocery stores. Majken and Emil went out of their way to help us get our bearings around the city, locate restaurants, etc.  I highly recommend this host."
5273,776012,282102538,2018-06-26,859481,Dorothee,"Die hübsche und gemütliche Wohnung von Majken liegt mitten in der Altstadt Stockholms in einem charmanten historischen Haus. Der Blick über die Dächer der Altstadt ist atemberaubend. Trotz ihrer zentralen Lage ist die Wohnung sehr ruhig. Alles war blitzeblank sauer und praktisch eingerichtet. Majken und Emil waren fürsorgliche Gastgeber. Die Kommunikation mit Ihnen war zuverlässig und herzlich.  Für eine Stadterkundung ist die Wohnung ideal gelegen, man kann fußläufig den Bahnhof und alle wichtigen Sehenswürdigkeiten erreichen."

5276,776012,305467977,2018-08-11,4984216,Wolfram,"Ett smultronställe, that means, it is extraordinary! The little apartment in Gamla stan is just charming. It is located on a calm street near the crowded center. Nicely decorated and equipped with everything you need. Majken and Emil are the bests hosts we had, ever, with airbnb. Some advice for those who are in Stockholm for the first time: Sundbergs konditoriet on Järntorget is the nicest café. The fish of ""Nystekt stömming"" with potatismus (on Kornhamnstorg) is delicious. And take some time to walk over to Skeppsholmen and have a beer on the ship Af Chapman by sunset.

I warmly I recommend"
5280,776012,498820963,2019-07-30,347857,Jill,"Majken and Emil's place is in an ideal location, right in the center of the historic district of Stockholm.  It's near the Palace, the main square, restaurants, anything you might want is just steps away.  There's a narrow circular stairway (about 73 steps ; ) leading to the top floor apartment, which has a lovely view over the rooftops of the old town.  Majken and Emil kindly met us when we arrived and showed us around the apartment.  It's absolutely charming!  So authentic and with lots of character.   It was lovely and clean and had everything we needed (although my 6'2"" husband did have to slightly duck going through doorways).  Majken and Emil were perfect hosts and provided a useful list of local restaurants.  We loved walking around Gamla Stan early in the day when the streets were quiet, before the tourists converged.  We used the Slussen ferry to get to neighboring islands.  It ran frequently and was very convenient. We particularly enjoyed the photography and Vasa museums, Skansen and the Palace.  We tried half the restaurants on Majen's list and they were all great!  Although maybe not for everyone, I liked running (well, maybe a fast walk) up the stairs to get my heart rate up - a nice little interval workout. All in all, we had a wonderful week in Stockholm! It's a beautiful city with lots to do.  But my fondest memory will be how incredibly nice everyone was, including our lovely hosts, who made our stay just perfect.  Thank you so much!"

5286,776155,3620242,2013-02-26,475474,Tomas,"We had the pleasure to stay at Ann-Sofie's beautiful apartment for a weekend in February. Ann-Sofie was a great host, very friendly and helpful. The apartment is just as nice as in the pictures, stylish, comfortable and well equipped. The bed was a dream! We really enjoyed the location, very central and close to the subway, nice restaurants and cafés, yet quiet and relaxed. 

We can highly recommend this place, we had a great time and would love to come back someday."
5287,776155,4455831,2013-05-06,1325454,Miguel,"Ann Sofie was just an amazing and excellent host. Even though we didn't see her we got in contact all the time and she helped us with the best info and the best tips of town: 100% recommended. The flat is awesome and comfortable; very well located in a beautiful neighbourhood. We spent a very good time there; I would come back again to her apartment without thinking twice!
"
5288,776155,4645007,2013-05-18,3379130,Julie,"Ann-Sofie's apartment was wonderfully situated in a fantastic walking neighborhood very near to the metro, so we could easily get everywhere we wanted.  It is a very safe and nice neighborhood.  The apartment itself was just beautiful, like a rustic and open penthouse, on the top floor of the building. It was spacious with a really nice outdoor space to enjoy the cool air and just sit and relax.  Ann-Sophie was so lovely and very easy to communicate with both via e-mail prior to our arrival and during via text. The only bummer is that we didn't cross paths at all!  I would rent this apartment again in a heartbeat and recommend it to anyone looking for an airy space to relax, cook themselves a meal and enjoy Stockholm.  Perfection!"
5289,776155,4887009,2013-05-31,5519018,Patrick,"What a perfect place to stay in Stockholm! We absolutely loved this apartment and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a quiet, stylish place in the middle of a great area in the city. The combination of old charm and new style was great, including the old stairway up from the front door. We walked everywhere, including to the Gamla Stan and other touristic sites, and then returned back to this locals neighborhood and had fantastic dinners nearby. On sunny evenings we drank wine on the little deck outside. Ann-Sophie was great at communicating with us and was easily reached when necessary and always helpful.
Thanks Ann-Sophie!"
5290,776155,6987066,2013-09-02,2741024,Tatiana,"The apartment was very clean, cozy, well equipt with all the necessities (I could even bake a cake if I wish!), bright and spacious and in a very covenient location.

The owner was friendly and very communicative and provided an excellent set of instructions for the flat and a nice personal guide for the neighborhood and all of Stockholm. The flat is in a great location and all points are easily accessible. It is well furnished, with a great kitchen area and a lovely terrace for enjoying the late setting sun. All in all, I would rate this experience very highly and would return again if it was available. "

Ann-Sofie met us upon arrival and was very friendly. She showed us where everything was that we'd need and answered all our questions."
5294,776155,21539507,2014-10-19,7941047,Erika,Ann Sofie was a wonderful host. The place was exactly as pictured. She welcomed me with a basket full of breakfast food after asking why I would like. I felt completely at home in her apartment. The location was wonderful and convenient. It was really the perfect stay. 
5295,776155,25051919,2015-01-05,3779995,Joseph,Ann-Sofie has a great flat in Stockholm. It is very clean and we appointed and situated very conveniently with good access via Odenplan. 
5296,776155,27211272,2015-02-28,25057573,Nicole,"I had a fantastic stay at Ann-Sofie's apartment in Stockholm in February.  Ann-Sofie greeted me at the apartment and was very accommodating when my flight was canceled and arrived two days later than scheduled.  Her apartment is lovely, it looks just like the photos provided, and was very clean.  Ann-Sofie asked what I wanted for breakfast and also left many details you don't always get with airbnb apartments - a robe and slippers, toiletries, washing powder, etc.  In fact when I inquired about the washing machine in the apartment and offered to bring my own washing powder she told me not too and to use what she had provided instead.  The apartment is a very short walk to the Odenplan metro stop and there are plenty of grocery stores and restaurants in the area.  It was a very easy experience and I would recommend this apartment to anyone.  Thanks Ann-Sofie!"
5297,776155,30141128,2015-04-18,25057573,Nicole,I had another great stay at Ann-Sofie's in April.  See my previous review for more details.

5299,776155,37132404,2015-07-05,27044670,Sarah,"Everything about Ann-Sofie’s apartment is just perfect and we really enjoyed our 5 night stay there.  It is spacious, beautifully furnished, superbly equipped and has many quirky features that make it feel very unique and special. The apartment is every bit as good as the photos would indicate and was spotlessly clean.
 The weather was hot at the time of our visit but the numerous windows and door to the balcony make it feel airy and also very light. (The bedroom’s blackout blinds were ideal for the light nights!)
The location is quiet and very convenient for the Odenplan metro station and therefore easy and quick to get to locations all over Stockholm.
We did not meet Ann-Sofie but her communications and instructions were prompt, helpful and clear; so consequently there was no problem with anything.
We would unreservedly and highly recommend this apartment; why would you consider a hotel when you could stay somewhere as lovely as this?

It is centrally located and really close to the Odenplan station which made getting around the city very convenient. The communication with Ann-Sofie was really easy and she went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed. She gave us information on the easiest way to get from the airport to the hotel and how much it should cost and she left us a packet of maps, and recommendations for restaurants when we arrived at the apartment. At the end of our stay, she even helped us book a taxi back to the airport. Really wonderful host!"
5303,776155,153611155,2017-05-21,125159628,Edward,"We can't recommend Ann-Sofie's flat enough! We were traveling on business, and the flat is perfectly situated. The neighborhood is very nice--a quiet street in a busy/thriving part of the city. Very walk-able and very close to everything you would need--restaurants, shops, grocery stores/markets, and Metro T stops. It was also very easy to catch a cab or Uber right outside as well. The flat is beautifully-decorated with tasteful, modern furnishings and art--a unique, comfortable space that really makes you feel like you're coming home every day. The kitchen is wonderful, and we loved using the outdoor patio--especially for breakfast. Ann-Sofie was a wonderful, gracious host throughout. She was very communicative, kind, honest, and welcoming. We had a wonderful time, and we can't recommend this flat/experience enough! Thank you."

5308,785218,5782025,2013-07-16,5848834,Sanna,"We spent a week in Fredrik's apartment in Stockholm. The apartment was everything we could hope for: spacious, clean and nicely furnished. The area in Stora Essingen was fairly quiet and it seemed like a nice neighbourhood. There is a play ground and a little wading pool for the kids nearby and crocery store not too far away. Even a beach is within a walking distance. You can reach the city easily by a bus or by a tram/subway."
5309,785218,37575130,2015-07-08,34452164,Caroline,"Wir haben drei Tage in Stockholm verbracht und Fredriks Wohnung war der beste Ausgangspunkt für Stadterkundungen, den man sich wünschen konnte. Die drei Etagen sind sehr beeindruckend und bieten viel Platz. Die gesamte Wohnung ist sehr hell und sehr sauber. Nur wenige Gehminuten entfernt befindet sich eine Bushaltestelle, von der man problemlos in das Stadtzentrum kommt. Fredrik und seine Frau sind unglaublich freundlich und haben schon im Planungsprozess geduldig alle Fragen beantwortet. Dieses Angebot können wir nur weiter empfehlen."

Het huis is ruim genoeg voor 6 personen en alle voorzieningen zijn aanwezig en van prima kwaliteit. Tijdens ons verblijf was het heel warm, door de nabij gelegen snelweg is buiten zitten op het balkon eigenlijk geen optie. Geen probleem, de nabij gelegen zwemgelegenheid is een perfect alternatief."

It is very well located in a very charming neighbourhood in the north of the city. You've got all that you need nearby (park, supermarket, systembolaget, subway, espesso house, bus station...)

There are many cute restaurants and cafes right near the apartment.  And it's very easy to get to all the major Stockholm attractions.

Gustav is an excellent host.  He was in touch before our arrival and greeted us right when we got to the apartment.  He gave us great recommendations for places to visit and restaurants to try.  He also offered us the use of his and his girlfriend's bikes in case we wanted a quicker way to get around the city.  We ended up walking all over the place because we prefer to see the city that way, but it was very nice of Gustav to offer and good to know that the option was there.

Gustav is very responsive to any question I had and even searched the apartment for me afterwards for something I’d left. Plenty of space for two people with all of the amenities you’d need! 
5355,795354,278033660,2018-06-17,44733461,Helen,"The place is located in a great neighbourhood. Shops and bars are near. Transportation is around the corner as well. The bathroom is better than on the pictures. Bed was comfy. Stairs to the apartment can be a bit intimidating, but a good exercise."
5356,795354,305444143,2018-08-11,21091570,Marcela,"Our staying at Gustav apartment was perfect. Gustav was very friendly, his apartment is very nice and perfectly located in the center. If you do not mind to step 4 floors, it is the right choice. Thanks Gustav, see you next time :-)"
5357,795354,331993396,2018-10-04,21132555,Sjoerd,Was in Stockholm for a business trip. The apartment was ideally located and very confortable.
5358,795354,344302441,2018-11-03,221509659,Kristina,Gustav is very accommodating and good st communicating. The apartment is well located. There is no lift so a four storey climb.
5359,795354,454960876,2019-05-19,196116647,Janne,Gustav’s place is greatly located in the center of Stockholm. The place is roomy and stylishly decorated. Highly recommended!
5360,795354,463314971,2019-06-03,102902364,Henrik,Great location and great host!
5361,795354,469326039,2019-06-14,6334523,Roberta,The place is exactly as shown in pictures with stylish touches. Good location to explore the city. I would recommend it.
5362,795354,480670400,2019-07-03,58824927,Jair,"O Gustav foi atencioso comigo desde o momento em que fiz a reserva até a minha saída, já dando uma positiva amostra de como os locais recebem e tratam os turistas. A apartamento é excelente e as fotos correspondem exatamente ao que se vai encontrar quando se está lá. Está bem equipado e com tudo à disposição do hóspede. Apesar de o apartamento não estar localizado no centro antigo (Gamla Stan), é possível ir até lá rapidamente de metrô (há uma estação muito próxima) ou a pé (15 minutos), dependendo da disposição e do preparo físico, aliás também necessário para enfrentar os quatro andares de escadas até chegar ao apartamento (não há elevador). Nas imediações, há bares, restaurantes, cafés e até uma lavanderia (em frente ao metrô Odenplan, que conecta o bairro ao aeroporto de Arlanda). Recomendo muito a hospedagem e voltaria lá com certeza. Deixo aqui um agradecimento ao Gustav."
5363,795354,486289844,2019-07-12,245814606,Nicholas,Very nice place and Gustav was great. Would stay here again.
5364,795354,501994840,2019-08-04,4366715,Kevin,Overall had a great stay and would consider again.  2 blocks to the nearest metro stop (Rådmansgatan) but honestly can walk around everywhere as the neighborhood is very quiet and safe - 15 minute walk to Stureplan and 30 minute walk to Gamla stan.  Green Rabbit is a block away if you want a nice fika.  Grocery store is also 3 blocks away.  His place had great working wi-fi and very clean.  He also left out an iron (I didn't use it) if that is important for people.  No elevator in the building (not a problem for me) but it is a walk up 4 flights if that matters.  Gustav was very responsive and communicative - thanks again!
5365,795354,511358084,2019-08-17,31656469,Teddy,"Gustav's place is a convenient location for exploring Stockholm! Definitely recommend as a spacious value pick.

Pros: Location (2 blocks from metro), clean, spacious, highly communicative host

Cons: Walk-up (5th floor), low on amenities (e.g., no A/C, dryer, older linens, etc.), can be a noisy street at night (if windows are open)"
5366,795354,522557266,2019-09-02,55006467,Yiwei,Comfortable and spacious apartment. Really close to public transportation.
5367,819676,77866976,2016-06-04,52889166,Jack,I was honoured to be their first guest! And what a wonderful privilege it was. 10/10. Vanessa couldn't do enough for me. She even let me leave my bag and come back for it later. The apartment is beautiful in the coolest location. Very quiet. I recommend it whole-heartedly!
5368,819676,79111579,2016-06-11,74825518,Yasmeen,"Very clean. Great location and friendly hostess. Take note that their free breakfast implies that you make something for yourself from their fridge. Great if you are just looking for a place to crash in an excellent location, but I would have rather stayed in a hotel for more privacy/comfort since I did not experience anything unique from my stay."
5369,819676,79311276,2016-06-12,29779903,Liis,"Had a lovely stay at Andy & Vannie's place! The apartment was fairly easy to find, just a minute from underground station Slussen in the heart of hip neighbourhood of Södermalm. Felt very welcome from the moment I arrived. Very nice and cozy room with loft views and own newly renovated bathroom for the guest to use, both just next to the main entrance, so you can have privacy if you wish to. Coffee and tea making facilities in the room. Perfect size for one person, but would fit two as well. Highly recommended!"
5370,819676,80109075,2016-06-16,52850681,Ioanna,"It was a very nice room with perfect bathroom. The location was perfect, just near the metro and walking distance to the old town. I didn't get the chance to talk a lot with the hosts, but in general they were very kind, helpful, and sociable. Recommended "
5371,819676,80287053,2016-06-17,76709108,Sandra,"This was a wonderfully located place to stay at. Very close to absolutely everything, and being a fan of walking I enjoyed this a lot. As I arrived pretty early in the morning they kept me posted if I could check in early (which to my luck I could) and also were super nice to offer the possibility of breakfast at 4 AM.

I do recommend it :)"
5372,819676,80902009,2016-06-20,31285216,Kean,"Andy & Vannie's apartment was amazing! The apartment is newly renovated and everything is new and clean! It is 3 mins away from the metro station Slussen and it was very easy to find. The neighborhood is quiet yet full of boutiques and restaurants. Walking distance to the Old town Gamla Stan. Vannie wasn't here during my stay, but Andy was very friendly, he even offered me umbrella and rain coat on the rainy day. I enjoyed my stay at this apartment a lot! "
5373,819676,81344310,2016-06-22,31365825,Dylan,Excellent location in Söder. Andy was very friendly and accommodating. Perfect set up for exploring Stockholm!

The hosts were very accommodating and easy to communicate with. 

The neighborhood is in the middle of everything you need to experience for the best of Stockholm. 

Wish I had more time to stay longer ! "
5376,819676,83619677,2016-07-03,40624884,Daniela,"Best hosts ever!
Vannie and Andreas did everything to make me feel comfortable and at home. They were so helpful and friendly. They are also very interesting and nice people. 
The apartment and the room are great, it is very nice having your own bathroom. 
I could not think of a better place to stay when you visit Stockholm.
Thanks for everything!"
5377,819676,84593439,2016-07-08,1705584,Jeremy,The space was even better than pictured. So close to everything and comfortable. Andy & Vannie were gracious hosts and were flexible in meeting me at a later time than expected. I would definitely stay with them again on my next visit.
5378,819676,85402072,2016-07-11,49304792,Natalie,"Andy and Vannie were beyond welcoming. From letting me check in super early after my train arrived at ~6am to letting me store my luggage on my last day while I squeezed in my last few hours of sightseeing, helpful suggestions on what to see and foods to eat, to movie nights and making me truly feel at home. The apartment itself is beautiful, renovated, and in a perfect location. I walked everywhere, around Södermalm, Gamla Stan, to Djurgarden. If I'm ever in Stockholm I know where I am staying. Highly recommend!! Thanks again Andy and Vannie!"
5379,819676,86133027,2016-07-15,48507940,Stephanos,"Andy and Vannie's place provides an excellent base for discovering central Stockholm (particularly Gamla Stan and the surrounding areas).
The apartment is ideally located (Slussen metro station is just around the corner!), the place is modern, cozy and comfy, the amenities excellent (great bathroom!) and although I didn't get the chance to meet my hosts in person, they were quick to respond to my queries and flexible enough to allow for accommodating my baggage until after my nominal check out time.
Overall a great experience and I will surely plan a visit at their place again. In fact, I'm looking forward to it; wish I had more days to spend there already!"
5380,819676,86740596,2016-07-17,9404492,Laetitia,"Andy and Vannie were not at home and asked a friend to be there to give me/get back the keys, it was very convenient."
5381,819676,87431593,2016-07-20,40035090,Roberta,"My stay at Andy & Vannie's flat was awesome. The location was perfect - right off the metro and in a neighborhood fairly comparable to Williamsburg (Brooklyn, NY). There was plenty to do on that island (Sodermalm) and a quick walk to other islands. The accommodations were very clean and comfortable. Plenty of amenities and privacy. As a single traveling gal, I'm mindful of my safety, but both the neighborhood and building are very safe. I no concerns or issues there. July was the perfect time of year to visit Stockholm and I'm so glad I found Andy & Vannie's spot to stay. Thanks!"
5382,819676,87945203,2016-07-22,78750486,Makiko,"Je suis passée un merveille séjours au cœur de Stockholm grâce à Andy & Vannie! La situation d'appart est superbe! On peut aller à Gamla stan à pied ( 10 mins ),en plus proche de métro. dans le quartier, il y a plein de boutiques, des supermarchés, des cafés, des restaurants, et bar... il y a tout ! mais l'appartement se situe juste la rue derrière donc la tranquillité est bien garantie.
L'appartement est parfait, très propres, et moderne, surtout plein de charme...! Vannie m'a assuré mon premier voyage à stockholm...ils sont vraiment au TOP!!! "

5385,819676,90391495,2016-08-01,78330753,Richard,"Die Unterkunft befindet sich im gediegenen Södermalm-Stadtteil Stockholms. Auch die Wohnung von Andy und Vannie steht dem Stadtteil in nichts nach. Es ist eine recht stylische Wohnung mit einem zwar kleinen, aber recht gemütlichen Gästezimmer. Das Bad ist direkt gegenüber und wie das Zimmer sehr sauber.
Andy hat mich auf der Straße vor dem Haus begrüßt. Er und seine Frau sind sehr sympathisch und hilfsbereit. Ich kann diese Unterkunft ohne Bedenken weiterempfehlen!"
5386,819676,91434971,2016-08-05,81642558,Violaine,"appartement très pratique. Pleins de petites attentions à l'arrivée: serviettes de toilettes fournies, bouilloire dans la chambre avec thé et café à disposition, un étage réservé dans le frigo avec de quoi faire un petit-déjeuner. Idéal pour une personne seule (chambre un peu petite). Vannie travaille à la maison et donc toujours présente ce qui est pratique en cas de question."
5387,819676,92106671,2016-08-07,58874921,Jonas,Centralt läge. Trevliga och hjälpsamma värdar. Väldigt fint rum och toalett med allt som kan behövas!
5388,819676,93583074,2016-08-13,13002475,Randal,"Andy and Vanessa's place is so good, I stayed there twice :). Located right next to Old Town, you can walk everywhere from their location. It's also close to the subway so you have access to and from central station.  They personally are a lovely couple who want their visitors to have a great time.  I highly recommend their lovely penthouse.  Plus, they live above a pub with great beer. :) "
5389,819676,94500821,2016-08-15,62544693,Alexandra,"Andy and Vannie are so kind, easy-going, and welcoming! They weren't able to meet me at the apartment last minute, so they had a friend come down and check me in to the room; it was very painless and their friend was just as great. The bed was a bit uncomfortable for me (very firm), as it is only a futon/sofa bed, but worked just fine. The apartment is incredibly nice, with an even nicer private bath. Great location and so much to do on the island. Highly recommend! Cheers, guys."
5390,819676,95063763,2016-08-18,726017,Sigurður Ellert,"I loved staying with Andy & Vannie they were really welcoming,  clear in communication before I arrived and we had some lovely talks while I was there. The room was perfect in every way, great bathroom, good bar downstairs and a great neighborhood with very nice old fashioned shops nice cafe's and wonderful atmosphere. "
5391,819676,95256007,2016-08-19,4665710,David,"Amazing penthouse apartment with your own bedroom and bathroom! Andy and Vannie were outstanding hosts - they were really accommodating, friendly, and generous. They made sure that I had everything I needed and they even went so far as to arrange travel for me to the airport when I was struggling to do so on my own (and made sure that I got there ok!). They are really wonderful. "

5394,819676,96975138,2016-08-25,15316642,Octaviano,"Great place. The room was newly remodeled and everything was very clean. The common areas in the apartment are spacious and new as well. 
Andy and Vannie do a great job with finishing touches like a setup to make coffee/tea in the room, etc.
But the most important thing to me is the awesome location. Just a two minute walk to Slussen T station, which means you can get anywhere quickly, and the neighborhood itself is the hip part of Stockholm, on Götsbacken overlooking Sofo."
5395,819676,98462781,2016-08-31,51394030,Vincent,I've been very well received during my stay in Stockholm. The apartment is in a very central and perfect position both for going out and visiting.

Andy made communication and entry simple. Andy is a great host and helped me plan my sightseeing day with great suggestions and directions.  Also  Got to spend an evening chatting with him and had great chat and a couple of beers together.   I would definitely recommend this airbnb when in Stockholm"
5398,819676,100642000,2016-09-10,84263940,Seonji,I really enjoyed staying in Andy & Vannie's house! It's very closed to the Slussen station which only takes 5min from central city and also walkable to the Oldtown. And the house is so cozy and clean and Andy was very helpful for any information. It was so convenient to use the private bathroom that is just in front of the room! I will definitely visit Stockholm again and will stay here again ;)

Jag hade nära till det som jag var intresserad av och dessutom låg det intill en av mina favorit pubar i Stockholm. Om jag är välkommen tillbaka så kommer jag att boka hos dom nästa gång jag kommer till Stockholm.

My room also had its own fridge and a water kettle, which made it easy to be self sufficient in many ways. I think Andy and Vannie were perfect Aribnb hosts.

The location was also very good. It was on a silent street next to the very busy Götgatan - which had wonderful coffee shops. The metro station was just a few steps away, but the Old Town and the city center were also within a walking distance. "

The flat is clean, spacious, and well-decorated in a laid-back modern theme. The shower and bathroom were very nice. The room and bed are a bit small, which is perfect if you're traveling by yourself, but I would be careful if you are extra tall or if you're traveling with another person. That said, the room was perfect for me ;)"
5418,819676,112484051,2016-11-06,28219682,Jennifer,Andy and Vannie went out of their way to make sure I was able to access the apartment in their absence.

Andy was kind enough to walk me to a post office when I needed it and both were welcoming friendly and relaxed. The room was cozy and clean. Perfect for relaxing after a long flight and exploring Stolkholm. The location is EXCELLENT. If you want to be close to Gamla Stan Etc this is perfect. Lots of cafes, restaurants, movies Etc. Perfect blend of touristic and residential. I would be happy to return the next time I visit. "

Two thumbs up and good luck brewing the Christmas beer! Skål!"
5426,819676,116177700,2016-11-28,23636173,Mari,"Close to the subway station, but if you are using US version of (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps, it will be somewhat tricky to find. I'm somewhat new to Airbnb and didn't look in the correct place for Andy & Vannie's last name - you will need this to buzz into the building! The area is convenient to Sodermalm and Gamla Stan areas, and was a good stop for a night in Stockholm."

Excellent location, super easy to/from the airports and city centre. Lots of shops and food options nearby. Would definitely stay again :) tack tack Andy & Vannie! "
5431,819676,120049111,2016-12-07,22119617,Nae,"My stay with Andy and Vannie was absolutely wonderful. I was a bit under the weather my first day so I didn't spend much time socializing, but the room was exactly as listed, clean, and comfortable. Andy met me at their home right after I got into the city to explain the keys and give me a tour which was wonderful to set my backpack down after flying in. On my second day, after wandering all over town and being quite exhausted, I was ready to turn in for the evening, but Andy was so kind and offered to hang out for a while - we went to the bar on the ground floor and then spent a while discussing Swedish vs American tastes in music. All in all, I had an absolutely wonderful time staying with Andy and Vannie and would love to come back again!"
5432,819676,120378942,2016-12-10,1036721,Paul,"Andy and Vannie's place is perfectly located near Slussen tube station, clean, cute, and private. Thanks so much for the stay!"

Andy & Vannie were very communicable and made the arrival process very easy.  The location is really tough to beat, only about a 1 min walk from the subway, and in a very hip part of town.  Would love to stay again when I return to Stockholm! "
5434,819676,121110075,2016-12-14,2170484,Julie,"Perfect location!

5440,819676,124974582,2017-01-03,13262860,Nicole,"Conveniently located, close to the subway (although we pretty much walked everywhere). The room & private bathroom were tidy and neat; the bed was cozy as well, and love the little TV in the room. The room was smaller than expected but the public area and shared kitchen were huge and got pretty much everything we needed. We had a few words with Andy and he was a very friendly and nice host, overall an enjoyable stay and this place is high recommended!"
5441,819676,125694472,2017-01-07,45029502,Solène,"Nice room. Better in real life than  it looks on the pictures. The room and the private bathroom are quite isolated from the main part of the flat, so it's almost like if you had an entire flat, but on the other hand you can easily reach for the hosts if wanted/needed. "
5442,819676,125942944,2017-01-08,90045638,Dailin,It is easy for me to find this house

5446,819676,127315696,2017-01-17,19931329,Shifei,"I've spent 4 days together with Andy & Vannie inside their apartment which is located near Slussen station, with plenty of cafes & restaurant nearby. If living like a local is something you'd like to experience then do not miss this opportunity. While parking could be an issue especially at night (which applies to the whole Stockholm city), you'd better be prepared if you are traveling with a car.

Living with Andy & Vannie is also a great fun. They showed me some hidden restaurants inside this community, even invited me to join their dinner the other night. They just made this city more charming!! Lovely hosts!"
5447,819676,127534329,2017-01-19,109855523,Addie,This was my first experience with Airbnb and Andy & Vannie made it a great one. Their place is a great location when utlizing the metro.

5449,819676,128617404,2017-01-26,3219190,Viktoria,The apartment is beautiful! The room is perfect for one or two people who don't want to stay all day home but explore the city. As it's tiny. But for us it was totally enough. And the private bathroom was really luxurious and so clean everything. Both Andy  and vannie were so nice and welcoming. Gave us advice and answered all our questions. Very helpful! The location is also just perfect. Everything important was in walking distance !  Thanks a lot for the great time! 
5450,819676,129360349,2017-01-30,24297037,Charlie,It's always nice when an airbnb lives up to and exceeds expectations. I had such a nice stay. Check in and check out were  a breeze. I felt this this was a perfect location for a first time Stockholm visitor looking to stay central but not in the middle of the tourist bubble of the old town. Great size for a solo traveler but I think it would have felt cramped if I was traveling with anyone 
5451,819676,129891947,2017-02-03,77691779,Amy,"I had a wonderful stay in Andy & Vannie's place in central Stockholm. They were very responsive, the room was even better than the pictures, and it is in the perfect central Stockholm location near restaurants, shops, and walking distance to tourist sites. Best of all Andy and Vannie are very nice people who will make you feel comfortable staying there. I highly recommend. "
5452,819676,131435484,2017-02-12,17797351,Nina,"Andy and Vannie 's place is perfect, located very centre of city , 2 min from the station , you can go everywhere easily by metro ,buses,ferry or walk . Accurate descriptions and pictures. But most thing I love is Andy and Vannie themselves . I caught a cold and Vannie take good care on me , they are super warm person and I feel
Very Welcome. They invited me to dinner and taco night and we spend some nice time on musics , foods , movie and talks. I had a 8 night long stay comfortably. If you do like privacy it's perfect for you too, I stayed a lot of Airbnbs but first I ever see a inner lock inside the guest room. overall it's the best experience I ever had , recommended !"
5453,819676,132681743,2017-02-19,6681306,Stefanie,We totally enjoyed our stay in Andys and Vannies apartment. It's perfectly located in the middle of everything. Recommendation!
5454,819676,133562607,2017-02-23,109066632,Susy,"Andy and Vannie's place is really well located. You'll find restaurants, bars, shops and nice sightseeing in the area . Really close to the old part of the city at a short walking distance, metro stations around, etc. They're lovely to provide with maps and guides of the city, and give suggestions according to your needs. We had a nice stay in their flat. "

5459,819676,135937749,2017-03-07,37084538,Eric,"Andy was great for our stay, our flights got pushed back and he was so accommodating. When we got there he helped us figure out the lay of the land and some of the things we should do. He was very friendly and I would highly recommend if this is available."

5461,819676,137079462,2017-03-13,35969841,Kerri,"Andy & Vannie's place is in the perfect location to explore Stockholm - in a lively part of town, very close to the subway station and an easy walk to Old Town and the ferry. The room itself was warm and cozy, and the bathroom was spotless. Was also fortunate to spend a little time with the hosts which was great! I'd love to stay here again next time I'm in Stockholm."

Andy&Vannie's place is awesome! There are many good small shops near the flat. Also you can visit Gamla stan, center of the city very easily by walk. I was happy to share a table and have a talk with them! I'll come back again;) Thank you."

5466,819676,140685335,2017-03-31,21735025,Yue,"We stayed for 2 nights here and really enjoyed our stay! Andy was warm, welcoming, and very nice to talk to. Communication was excellent, he always responded to any questions right away. This AirBnB is in an excellent location and very central. Andy allowed us to drop our bags early and made everything so easy. The room is cozy, the penthouse overall is a very clean and beautiful space. Highly recommend and would stay again if we are in Stockholm. "
5467,819676,141151444,2017-04-02,31498372,Karl,"Andy was very attentive and helpful, we had everything we needed and enjoyed our stay as well as the neighbourhood.

5471,819676,146455179,2017-04-23,637645,Catherine,"Andy & Vannie are perfect hosts! They are super friendly, very helpful in finding locations/places especially that I cannot read map so that shows how much patience they have! :-)
House is very upscale and clean and smells very nice! :-)
Room is good for a solo traveler. I got my own toilet/shower although not inside the room but that is ok.
Location - very very good - 10min walk to Gamla Stan; and just around the corner is Slussen station. This Metro line is very good because there are lot of different trains that stops here.
On this same street, Gotgatan and parallel to where Andy & Vannie leaves, there is a lot of boutiques and cafe/bars. Also there is a House of Candy near the station! :-)
Walk further down Gotgatan (away from Gamla), you'll find a street perpendicular to it which also has some restaurants/bars and some supermarkets.
Very hip neighborhood, residential but has a few restaurants and shops too. 
I highly recommend Il Tempo if you are into Italian. This is on the same street as their place. Great pasta!!
At the end of their street, across from the square is a Coop supermarket, which is open until 11pm.
I will definitely stay here again. I like the ambience of this place but most importantly too is I like the hosts! I travelled alone so having friendly hosts made my experience much more wonderful.
Make sure to go to House of Candy -- for chocolates!"
5472,819676,146901942,2017-04-24,637645,Catherine,"If you want to have a taste of Swedish hospitality, stay at Andy's and Vannie's! The location to shops, Metro and being in a hip neighborhood are just a plus, their home is really a home away from home and I will recommend them to my friends! Love my bed (slept well all the time!) and love the shower and toilet! Minimalist design! "
5473,819676,147394960,2017-04-26,48174024,Carina,"Very friendly welcome even though I arrived very late at night. Enjoyed the excellent coffee the next morning. Since I had to work the little desk in the room was a bit to small for me, really appreciated the comfort of the private bathroom. Nice neighbourhood, good restaurants and shops close by. "

She helped us plan our days, told us the best grocery store to go to, and went the extra mile when we needed it. A clean place that is located right next to Gamla Stan, which is where we spent our few days. Thanks for a great stay!"
5477,819676,152710650,2017-05-18,27130711,Laura & Nathan,"Our stay in Stockholm was enhanced by having Andy and Vannie as our hosts. We encountered lost luggage on our flight from Copenhagen to Stockholm and Andy assisted in receiving the suitcase when delivered the following morning. Our stay in Stockholm was split as we took an overnight ferry to Riga, Latvia and Andy coordinated our departure and return perfectly so we were able to capitalize on our time exploring Stockholm. This AirBnB location was perfect in regard to proximity to Gamla Stan. Thanks for a great visit!"

The room was small but adequate.  The neighborhood was centrally located, and we were able to walk to everything from there.  Andy was especially helpful in getting us to our cruise ship when we were unable to get a taxi.  Overall, we were quite satisfied."

Clean and cosy room with a lovely view of the Old Town and a fancy private bathroom. The location was a stones throw from just about all the hippest joints in town. Andy & Vannie were also generous with their time, and gave me great advice on what to do in town. Don't hesitate to stay here-it's perfect for those who want to stay a few nights and catch the highlights of Stockholm. Thank you, I'll be visiting again!"

Vannie welcomed me and showed me my room and bathroom. It was nice and clean. And the apartment is in a quiet street, so I had a good sleep. Around the corner, there is a very nice and hip shopping street. Great location! "
5486,819676,162456802,2017-06-21,63003506,Doug,Incredible location with easy access to the splendors of Stockholm. Gracious hosts. Bedroom is indeed small but the bathroom is spacious and lovely.

5489,819676,164927818,2017-06-29,25228816,Frédéric,"Beautiful flat as shown on the photos and on top floor so very calm also.
It is located north of Solderman right next to a nice pub ""Oliver Twist"".
So everything especially Gamlan Stan area is walking distance from here :-)
Vannie & Andy were great host and I highly recommended this B&B!!
Thank you Andy for bring me to Omnipollo to taste good craft beer & pizza ;-)"

Andy and Vannie both work so they had a colleague on hand to check me in--it was very smooth. My room was simple but very comfortable, complete with a little refrigerator. My private bathroom was also well-equipped. 
I chose this place partly because of location, and was not disappointed. Close to shops, restaurants, and very convenient to public transportation.
All in all, a great first Airbnb experience. I would stay with Andy and Vannie again in a minute."

5495,819676,173814166,2017-07-24,117061507,Tim,"Leider konnten wir unsere Gastgeber nicht persönlich kennenlernen.
Unsere Erwartungen, wir haben airbnb das erste mal genutzt, waren einfach andere.

Das Zimmer ist klein, wir sind beide relativ groß, das Bett ein wenig kurz und unbequem, aber für zwei, drei Nächte ok. 

Der private Kühlschrank neben dem Bett ist gut gemeint, kann nachts aber störend sein."
5496,819676,175075289,2017-07-28,32489403,Lauren,"Andy and Vannie are great and friendly hosts! Andy gave us some bar/ restaurant recommendations, which helped us have a great experience in Stockholmes. He was available to answer our questions when needed. We enjoyed the great location (close to Slussen station, walking distance to Gamla Stan, lots of hip bars and cafes, grocery stores, etc.). Highly recommended!"

5500,819676,188691545,2017-08-30,6155131,Marie,"A wonderful, budget-friendly, and incredibly located place to stay for individuals or couples! The room is quite small — containing a queen-sized bed, a table, a chair, a mini fridge, and a TV on a chest of drawers, with not that much floor space — but enough room and all of the essentials needed to stay for a few days comfortably (we were there for 6 nights). Really appreciated the private bathroom, as we could unpack and store our toiletries without worries of cluttering their space. The apartment is also in a great, central part of the city — within a few minutes' walk to the nearest train station, one stop from Gamla Stan, or you could just walk across the bridge to Gamla Stan within 15 minutes. And plenty of adorable cafes and shopping in their neighborhood. Andy was particularly helpful in giving suggestions for activities and even offered to help us book tickets for the boat to Drottningholm, which was very kind! Overall a lovely, comfortable place to stay, great value, and very friendly, warm, helpful hosts. Highly recommended!"

5505,819676,194595465,2017-09-17,5841967,Lovísa,"This was my first time staying in an airbnb with the apartment owners there as well. I decided to try because of the excellent reviews of Andy's and Vannie's place. It did not disappoint. The room was all I needed and the private bathroom was spotless and very spacious. I loved the little fridge in the room! The location is brilliant, very short walk into Gamla Stan and it's easy to get around from the flat. And finally, Andy and Vannie were very friendly and helpful. Thank you!"

When I walked out of the building, there was so much beauty all around me. Andy was a very hospitable and flexible host; he met me earlier than check in time to make sure I got my keys and was in the building safely. The flat itself is large and beautiful. I had the perfect introduction to my first stay in Stockholm."
5508,819676,199075471,2017-10-01,141933169,Janice,The location is excellent. It was so easy to walk and see the sights. Stockholm is a very interesting city with a cosmopolitan flare.

I would definitely recommend staying there!"
5511,819676,203959090,2017-10-16,4881286,Ivy,"Andy is friendly and communicated well with me throughout the trip. It was great not only to have a private room, but a private bath as well. The room and bathroom were clean and all essentials were provided for. The location is just a short walk from the metro. I am one happy camper. Thank you for a smooth and pleasant stay in Stockholm!"
5512,819676,204487058,2017-10-18,46892728,Hannah,"I unfortunately didn’t get to meet Andy & Vannie, as they were both out of town during my stay. Their friend, Lindsey, checked me in. Regardless, I really enjoyed my stay! Andy checked in on me to make sure everything was okay. Their home is very stylish and in the perfect location. The metro (Slussen Station) is very close by, so I was easily able to go exploring. The room was small, but I didn’t mind it at all. It was more than enough space for me! As a single traveler, I felt very safe walking alone in that part of town regardless of the time of day. Overall, I really enjoyed it! I highly recommend this place!"
5513,819676,205119438,2017-10-21,149987207,Véronique,"Andy and Vannie are great hosts. Their apartment is exactly as described, very well equiped, very clean and with a great location in Stockholm, it's situated in a very quiet building and street.I definitively recommend their apartment."

The apartment, which is very nice and clean, is in a fantastic location in Sodermalm.  Really enjoyed my time in Stockholm and would definitely stay here again!"
5517,819676,210432994,2017-11-09,152632813,David,"The room itself was cozy and just big enough to be what I needed. It had a tv, a small fridge, bottled water, a tea kettle and an amazing bathroom. The bed was a bit alarming with how hard it was, at first, then after I laid on it, I realized it actually form-fitted to me and became incredibly comfortable! If you are staying in the Slussen area, I highly recommend visiting with them!!!"
5518,819676,213633967,2017-11-22,16589765,Zach,Such a great location! Both Andy and Vannie were very helpful in directing me around the town.

5519,819676,217400235,2017-12-09,25957182,Paul,"A great location in a cool neighbourhood in Stockholm, with food and bars nearby.  It's a cute and cosy apartment with nice views.  
If you are a walker (like me) it is about 5-10 minutes to Gamla Stan, and 20 minutes to Kungstradgarden. Metro options also very convenient.
I would stay there again."

As a solo traveler the space was cozy and just the right amount, you even will have your own personal bathroom. I would highly recommend staying here. You are within a 3 minute walk to the metro as well at stop Slussen."
5522,819676,220641338,2017-12-23,27618263,Alejandra,The place is beautiful and in a really good location. The room and bathroom are spacious and spotless.

5527,819676,229379606,2018-01-23,5813349,Milena,"Andy & Vannie's place is in the perfect area to discover Stockholm. Closed from Slussen and the old city center, Sodermalm is the best location to stay in Stockholm.
Andy and Vannie were very welcoming and the apartment and the room as described on the pictures.
All very good! Thank you."
5528,819676,230156075,2018-01-27,31822106,David,"Definitely best location to stay in Stockholm , only minutes to walk into “old town” area and surrounding lively area with shops, food eateries etc. While room is small, has a great comfortable bed,their Unit is large and modern so everyone has space, lovely couple, definitely recommend staying here."

The host was wonderful and We really appreciated the accommodation for a late check in / letting us store our bags on the day we checked out. This room is perfect for exploring Stockholm - located in such a great part of the city (which is very walkable).
5531,819676,232963363,2018-02-07,4475130,Jaakko,Location was perfect and apartment was also nice. Everything was as expected and Vanessa was nice as well. Would definitely stay again.
5532,819676,233568722,2018-02-10,26290555,Cedric,"Expérience lamentable...
Accueil mauvais, j'ai attendu un message du propriétaire pendant 2 bonnes heures après mon arrivée à l'aéroport. Par chance, j'ai réussi à rentrer dans l'immeuble. Une fois au 6e, j'ai sonné et une dame m'a ouvert la porte, visiblement très fâchée, elle m'a montré une chambre à gauche, sans autre accueil, ni information.
La chambre est très petite et se trouve directement à l'entrée de l'appartement. Les sanitaires sont en face ( agréables ). Je dis cela parce que quand le propriétaire ou sa femme rentre le soir, vous serez dérangés. 
La deuxième nuit fut épouvantable, car la femme du propriétaire a fait du trafic toute la nuit et a quitté l'appartement à 5h du matin. Impossible de dormir, malgré mes demandes réitérées de faire un peu de silence.
Ces gens selon moi traversent une mauvaise passe... et n'ont pas de temps à perdre avec vous ni d'égard concernant la tranquillité.
 
Je ne peux que vous recommander à éviter cette location en allant bien vite voir ailleurs."
5533,819676,235331603,2018-02-16,1739787,Belle,"I only got to meet Andy because Vanny was on a business trip. However, Andy was extremely accommodating and touched base with me numerous times prior to my arrival. He was able to give me clear directions and I easily found my way to the apartment. 

He greeted me warmly once I walked in and gave me a quick tour of the apartment along with a “How-to” with the appliances since American kitchen technology is eons behind Europe’s. 

After the tour, I quickly settled into my room and unpacked a bit of my suitcase. The room was very warm and cozy and could definitely accommodate 2 people but no more than 2. The private bathroom was great because I was able to lay out my bathroom products without cluttering up a shared bathroom. 

Overall, my entire stay was extremely lovely and pleasant. Andy and Vanny’s place was spotless, clean and in a very hip neighborhood! If I were to come back to Stockholm, I would definitely reserve Andy and Vanny’s place again. 

Perfect location, perfect atmosphere, perfect hosts, spotlessly clean... what more can you ask for?!"
5534,819676,238245014,2018-02-25,22179904,Sergey,"Andy and Vannie гостеприимные хозяева. У них очень уютная стильная квартира, в которой есть все необходимое для комфортного проживания. Квартира удобно расположена, находится недалеко от центра, но в тоже время в ней тихо."
5535,819676,239059856,2018-02-28,130816494,Michael,This is an amazing apartment close to the main tourist attractions in Stockholm.  It is easy to reach from the airport and central train station.
5536,819676,241025031,2018-03-07,96294352,Tracy,Great location with plenty of food options and really easy to get around from Slussen. Having a private bathroom is certainly a bonus and the bed was the most comfy during my week long stay in Sweden. Vannie is so lovely and helpful and it was a shame I didn't get to meet Andy but will hopefully meet him the next time I'm here!
5537,819676,242027387,2018-03-11,4216030,Frédéric,Everything went very fine at Andy & Vannie's. The apartment's situation is like perfect: very easy to get anywhere by walking or using public transportation. The apartment itself was clean and calm and it's very convenient to have your own bathroom during the stay. Both the room and the bathroom are at the entrance of the apartment so that you feel very independant during your stay. I would also add that both check-in & check-out were convenient as Andy & Vannie let me arrive and leave whenever it suited me best. Thanks!
5538,819676,244233175,2018-03-18,29425928,Laura,"The Apartment was just as described. The communication was really good.
Vannie and Andy Are very uncomplicated, so there were no Problems with Check in or Check out.
the location is absolutly perfect - I did all tours by Foot.
the only Thing to mention is the fridge. It is very useful, but very loud. It just starts making a Sound when you don't expect it. Altogether : highly recommended"
5539,819676,249522875,2018-04-02,909382,Katie,"Wonderful stay! The hosts weren’t there during my stay but it was super easy to check in and use the flat, they are pros who gave very clear instructions. Great location, comfortable bed and private bathroom just across the hallway. Really impressed that they list such a nice apartment on Airbnb- it’s great value. They even left out some snacks and fruit which was really thoughtful. Great location for Sodermalm, highly recommend!"
5540,819676,252867037,2018-04-12,10496400,Elizabeth,"I enjoyed the convenience of the location as well as the proximity to stores, restaurants, bakeries and coffee places. It was just minutes away from everything. Both Andy and Vannie were perfect hosts, pleasant and polite, and always willing to assist in any way. 

Stockholm was beautiful and you complemented that in every way.
Thank you. 

Elizabeth"

5543,819676,256134326,2018-04-22,12800686,Martin,"Really nice apartment, clean, fresh and just as stylish as it looks in the pics.  Central location, cosy Söder / Slussen with bars, restaurants and shops for those who like that, very close to the tube and then only two stops to Stockholm C and T-centralen.

Andy was a great host, made my stay a breeze. Friendly and welcoming, quick to answer any questions. If you travel alone or with your partner, and you're looking for a central place  from which it's easy to get around I heartily recommend you rent this room."

The bathroom is lovely and the bed was super comfortable. Their place is close to public transport, but also within walkable distance to Gamla Stan.

5552,819676,271348171,2018-06-01,13647908,Stephen,"This is an ideal place to stay. The bedroom I stayed in was small but comfortable with access to a private bath with a shower across the hall. Andy made me feel comfortable to use the living room and kitchen which allowed for lots of space.  The check in was well arranged. The place has an elevator and it’s a secure building. The neighbourhood is lively with restaurants and shopping as well as nightlife. It’s close to a metro and only 2 stops from Central Station. Andy gave good recommendations on things to do for a short stay in Stockholm. In spite of its central location, it was quiet in his place. A perfect place to stay."

Andy & Vannie’s place also includes good wifi, a television, a small fridge, tea and coffee making facilities and lots of helpful information.  The apartment is in Södermalm and quite close to Gamla Stan, which was perfect for my visit to Stockholm.  Andy & Vannie were very friendly and provided lots of local tips.  They also went out of their way to enable early check-in so that I didn’t need to find somewhere to store my luggage for the day."
5560,819676,289009298,2018-07-11,39154629,Jane,"Andy was a great host. He even let me borrow the laundry facilities which was very generous. Perfect location and very happening.

5561,819676,290301330,2018-07-14,129563817,Tho,I had a wonderful stay at Andy's flat. Andy is extremely friendly. He let me check in early to leave my bags. He even offered me a glass of wine. The private bathroom across the corridor is extremely convenient. I highly recommend his place.
5562,819676,297006478,2018-07-27,24898378,Diane,"My stay at Andy and Vannie’s penthouse apartment will be remembered as the highlight during my Scandinavian journey! I really appreciated how friendly and welcoming Andy was from the very greeting he did by opening the door. Also, he kindly let me use the laundry machine :) It was also so wonderful to meet his brother’s family.

During the heat wave, Andy thoughtfully put in a rotating fan tower and also the small refrigirator in the private room also helped a lot! The private bathroom right across from the room is so modern and convenient! 

5 stars for being easy to communicate, central location ( Please try Cardamom Bread from Fabrique Bakery. I had that every morning! Soooo gooood!) and comfort of all the things offered at this apartment by this awesome host! Highly recommend!"
5563,819676,308332843,2018-08-16,24370259,Catherine,Lovely hosts. Spotless flat. Central location - in quiet street. Super bedroom with a very nice shower rom. I felt I could be as private - or as convivial as I wished!

Vannie and Andy are the most friendly, kind, caring and helpful people you can imagine and their home is both beautiful and comfortable. I had some trouble getting a phone card to work with my credit card and Vannie actually used her own credit card in order to make it work--that is WAY above and beyond and very much appreciated! I will absolutely stay with them again...they are THE BEST!! : )"
5566,819676,315990608,2018-08-30,131126822,Jessica Jeeyoung,"I usually do not write reviews about air bnb I stayed. However, this place was wonderful in many aspects. First of all, it was very easy to communicate with the host and access to his place. Even though I needed to check-in a bit early, he helped me to check in and bring my luggage in. Secondly, it was only 5 min walk away from Slussen stn., so there was no need to spend lot of energy finding the accommodation. The size of the room was little bit smaller than I expected, but enough for single person, and wonderful view from the room and private toilet explained everything. If you are considering to stay at this place, I definitely recommend it so don't miss it!"
5567,819676,318668418,2018-09-04,7214954,Eve,"I stayed here for 4 nights and had a wonderful visit to Stockholm. This apt. is in a great area of the city, very close to public transportation. The room and bathroom was very clean and felt very private since this is at one end of the apartment. They also offer tea/coffee within the room which is a nice touch and a TV. The bed was comfy and the bathroom was very comfortable with the rain showerhead and warm towel drying rack! Everything was very modern and there is an elevator in the building.

Communication with Andy was always great and easy. I hardly saw my hosts during the time I was there but they seem like lovely and warm people. If I were to visit Stockholm again I would definitely stay here. The neighborhood is really great and different than staying down in the city center. More cozy, quaint with tons of outdoor places to eat. Highly recommend!"

Old town is just across the bridge - walking distance. Hop on buses or boat is also within walking distance. Great location to explore other parts of the city. 

Apart from that, Andy is easy going and friendly, giving recommendations for places to visit or eat."

Vanessa and Andy were even headed away for the weekend and allowed my friend and I to stay in the apartment on our own.  Access to their Guest Netflix was a plus on nights that we ended early.
5575,819676,421961446,2019-03-10,17053067,Lukas,"Very kind and helpful hosts. Always up for a chat and morning coffee, but also respectfull of privacy when you want it.  Location is outstanding. Hip part of town, close to the metro. You can get anywhere in Stockholm in 20 mins or less. Fast wifi, and your own bedroom and bathroom. The shower has glass doors which was nice after staying in some other places in Sweden with ""wet bathrooms"" haha.  Would definitely recommend to others and consider staying there again myself if I ever make it back to Stockholm."
5576,819676,426169228,2019-03-20,28992733,Carolina,"Excellent location and accomodation, Andy is really a great host- I hope to meet Vannie next time too ! It was ideal to me to have some „Peace &Quiet” and also exchange with hosts - GREAT!"

The apartment was clean and nice ! They gave some great local tips and restaurants suggestions! I would def recommend staying here if Visiting for the weekend !
5582,819676,454980965,2019-05-19,92802693,Ahila,"The location is the best part, as it is very close to Slussen tunnelbana. Also, the room and private bathroom are at the entrance of the apartment so you can come in and go out, without disturbing the hosts. Comfortable little room with a great heated bathroom."
5583,819676,458744791,2019-05-26,27039205,Alice,A nice room with high quality facilities. Both hosts are friendly and easy to communicate. Location is very central and is close to public transportation and shopping areas. Highly recommended!

Letto comodo, frigo in stanza, bagno modernissimo, ad uso esclusivo, subito di fronte alla camera. Posizione strategica a breve distanza a piedi da Gamla Stan e a due minuti dalla fermata della metropolitana."
5586,819676,469135790,2019-06-14,22850567,José Antonio,Perfect location. Very clean place. Excelent bathroom. The room is a bit small but enough for those who don't need space to work. The guests are kind and let you confortable without too much interaction. What is perfect to me. I fully recommend.
5587,819676,473676599,2019-06-22,56640293,Shanna,"We couldn’t have asked for a better spot for our first trip to Stockholm. Everything was super easy to get to and the biggest bonus was the apartment is close to the train station so we didn’t have far to go with our luggage. 

Great spots nearby for beer, shopping, coffee and a great view of the midnight sunset on the waterfront - all a quick 5 mins walk from the front door. Andy was a great host, even offered some recommendations for us to watch the US women’s soccer match! Highly recommend if you’re just looking for a place to crash in between exploring."
5588,819676,476842675,2019-06-27,639643,Kristel,"FIVE STARS + VIP
Andy and Vannie´s place is awesome! I give them 5 stars because:
a) Super clean place.
b) Privacy + own shower room. 
c) Outstanding location + safety. 
d) Kind, helpful and respectful hosts.
e) Close to public transportación + bars + restaurants + view. 
f) If you are a solo traveler, like I was this time, then do not hesitate about booking with Andy and Vannie, you won´t regret it. The penthouse is better than a hotel, and you will feel at home, while you are away from your own.
If I get to go back to Sweden, I will look for this place again, no doubts!
=)))))"
5589,819676,487806170,2019-07-14,142578760,Yoko,"Andy & Vannie’s place was great. Close station, there are many nice restaurants and cafeterias, nice location."

Fantastic location close to:  public transportation, coffee shops, bars and city views. The bed was comfortable and had a delightful window view. Would stay again"
5595,819676,520272570,2019-08-30,5795365,Paula,"This is a great flat, and Andy & Vanessa are lovely hosts.  It's a perfect location for the nearby metro stop Stussen, which takes you everywhere you'd ever need to go.  The room is great and having your own bathroom is very convenient. I highly recommend this accomodation"

5598,819676,529206622,2019-09-14,32367847,Julia,"My boyfriend and I stayed at this apartment for three nights. The location is great! Sodermalm is a fun area which also has a good connection to the rest of stockholm via metro. Andy was home during our stay and we spent two evenings chatting with him and getting local tips. The apartment itself is very clean and has a nice interior. The room is small, but perfect for a short stay, and you have your own bathroom. Would definitely recommend this place to my friends! Thanks Andy!"
5599,819749,81679668,2016-06-24,22903689,Kaylee,"Our stay at Carl's was wonderful. The apartment was in walking distance of grocery, restaurants and old town. It was the perfect location to get to know Stockholm from a local perspective. The kitchen was well equipped to cook our own meals. "
5600,822497,3908351,2013-03-26,5044485,Michael,"It was a wonderful stay in Stockholm!
Moa arranged everything just perfect and she was very caring and friendly. Besides her appartment is so nice! And is really not far away from the metro station.
We really enjoyed it a lot ..."

We loved staying there: calm beautiful neighbourhood, lovely and comfortable apartment for 5, close to center, metro during day and bus at night so there was no problem getting there at any time of the day or night. Thanks a lot, Moa, for welcoming us into your home."
5602,822497,4596811,2013-05-14,502490,Iurii,"Me and my friends had exellent stay in this wonderful apartment where everything is made with love. It makes us feel like at home during our stay. Moa is a great host. We had feeling that we are staying at friend's apartment. She met us at metro station (which is really close to apartment), she bought the breakfast for us, she was flexible with check-out. Definitely reccommended! This apartment will have highest priority to stay for my further visits to Stockholm."
5603,822497,4805320,2013-05-27,5705503,Marie,"Thanks Moa.
Nice contact. I always got fast replies to my questions. 
Pretty appartment.
TOP!
The place is close to the station and the city! My advice: With Moa as your host your trip to Stockholm will be great!!
"
5604,822497,5079729,2013-06-11,2022700,Miriam,"My friends and I had a pleasant stay. The communication went well and Moa's apartment was pretty, spacious and clean. We also got some breakfast. For our next stay in Stockholm, we would love to come back."
5605,822497,5606457,2013-07-08,1863479,Christina Ann,"Moa was an excellent host - the communication was swift, precise and welcoming. And she had put out little notes for us as guides to the flat - and had bought us milk, bread and other small stuff, that made us feel at home.
The flat was very practical for us: a family of five. Very neat and clean. Charming with a balcony where we could eat our meals out. 
The area is a southwestern suburb to Stockholm, but the tubestation is just around the corner - and trains are precise and often. It is a quiet neighbourhood - green and with good grocery shopping, cafées and good ethnique take-aways. People are nice and friendly. It didnt take long before our 10 year old son had found a boy in the area that played football and  played with him and his friends at the local school several times.
Thanks Moa - for a wonderful stay. We will be asking to borrow your flat again next time we are going to Stockholm."
5606,822497,6192111,2013-08-03,6286648,Edoardo,"Moa is a very kind person, she let us all we need, her home is fantastic and the city center is not so long. We have a great experience in Stockholm also thanks to her."
5607,822497,6681243,2013-08-21,5350042,Wolfgang,"Everything as described: pretty, clean, spacious and well equipped apartment, quiet surroundings and nearby subway station. 
Moa is very caring, welcomed us (3 persons: parents and son) very friendly and even provided food for us!
In summary: highly recommended! (five stars :))
Thank you Moa for the wonderful stay!"
5608,822497,7035072,2013-09-04,1998719,Sergey,"Spacious and comfortable apartment in quiet place not far from Stockholm Centre. Moa is very cute, pleasant and 	
attentive. If you travel in company of 3-5 in Stockholm I recommend to stay here. Thank you, Moa!
	
"
5609,822497,7277664,2013-09-14,7730099,Malcolm,"Yet another excellent Air BnB pick! Moa was the perfect host. She provided us with clear and concise instructions using public transit to arrive at her apartment where she greeted us warmly. She explained how everything worked and said we could contact her with any questions we might have had. She even left us some breakfast stuff in the fridge! The apartment was as the photos suggested. It was a lovely lived-in, sun-filled, bright, clean, tidy and spacious for two couples, which we were. Above all, although it was located outside the city centre, the metro stop was a two to three-minute walk from the apartment. The journey into and out of the city centre was 15 minutes. Hardly anything at all."
5610,822497,8054243,2013-10-14,3591982,Milly,"We had such a fantastic time in Stockholm, made complete by Moa's perfect apartment! Four friends, staying for three nights, we wanted somewhere not too far from the hustle and bustle, but with space to cook and chill at the apartment, and Moa's place offered just that.
The apartment is clean, stylish and well equipped, just a few minutes stroll from the metro stop which takes you to the Central stockholm in ten mis, or to neighbouring Södermalm a trendy, charming area with lots of bars and restaurants.
Moa was a brilliant host, left us with loads of tips about where to go, and even left us a tasty breakfast. Really couldn't have asked for a more perfect stay. Would definitely recommend her apartment to anyone, and hope we'll be back!"
5611,822497,8542473,2013-11-04,9479863,Christopher,"hat a great time at moas appartement! perfect location, quiet but still close to town, everything you need basically. Nice welcome and support, thanks to you we had a graet time in stockholm, was not the last time!
"
5612,822497,8920546,2013-11-25,3921996,Jeff,"Moa has a lovely apartment in a great neighbourhood that is easy to get to and from. 

She was super helpful by providing lots of maps and ideas of where to spend time in Stockholm and was always available for any questions we had. 

Being a 2 minute walk from the tram (i.e. underground/subway) is really convenient, it takes you everywhere you need to be in the city. 

Stockholm is beautiful and you will absolutely love it. 

If in Stockholm, seriously consider staying at Moa's, it's perfect in every sense of the way. "
5613,822497,9179508,2013-12-11,3291142,Ian,"Excellent apartment and a very friendly and helpful host. Thoroughly recommended.
"
5614,822497,10695512,2014-03-03,12221951,Noemie,"The apartment was exactly as presented on the pictures. It is cozy, clean and warm. We were five people but we could have been more, as it was big enough.
Moa was a really great host. We didn't have the pleasure to meet her, but she arranged everything fine for the exchange of the keys, and her mom even came to pick us up at the metro station on our arrival.
She was really nice and even let us leave the apartment pretty late on our last day, so we could enjoy the city without being weigh down by our luggages.
Thank you again, Moa!"
5615,822497,11091167,2014-03-20,4016485,Jas Xu,"Moa was great, she kept in contact the whole time and gave us recommendations :) the place is nice as well! "
5616,822497,11251050,2014-03-26,12777059,Lex,Mos was very helpful and kind. She gave us step-by-step directions all the way from the airport to her front door. The house is clean and comfortable. 
5617,822497,11429466,2014-04-02,5095781,Jim,"Our family of 5 enjoyed our stay at Moa's--she was so kind to take the time to recommend some ""must-sees"" in Stockholm and give us directions on how to get around. Thanks Moa!"
5618,822497,11867576,2014-04-17,10579788,Vicky,The location is perfect and right next to the metro station. We had a lovely stay for 3 nights. 
5619,822497,12002553,2014-04-21,10833837,Karen,"We had a great stay in Moa's place. So bright and open with lots of space for our family of four - just as in the pics. Close to the metro and easy to get downtown, and also cafes nearby in the neighbourhood. Moa met us, and gave us some help with directions and tips on the city, and left us some coffee/tea and chocolate - just what you need after your journey! "
5620,822497,12293189,2014-04-28,13234320,Hanna,"Moa is a great host, she is supernice and the communication with her was superb.  Her flat was exactly as shown in the pictures. We have been 5 persons and everyone had a real bed to sleep on. She provided us Coffe, tee and, towels and even shampoo. The location of the flat is optimal, its next to a grocery store and a metro station. I would highly recommed Moa :)"
5621,822497,12750970,2014-05-10,5641930,Barb,"Apartment was a excellent choice for  family of four stay in Stockholm.  Convenient location to the subway into town about 15 minutes.  Also street parking was available even at late evening hours.
Our host Moa was very accommodating. Our flight was delayed and we arrived late in the evening. Moa was happily waiting for us and gave us a quick lay of the land and a few tips before leaving us for the night. She was also so kind to have a couple of items stocked in the kitchen (even a little Swedish chocolate!!! This was a first for us and we are frequent airbnb/ (Hidden by Airbnb) users) for the tired travelers that we were.  It was great to not have to search for breakfast(especially) on our first morning. Thanks Moa!"
5622,822497,12815814,2014-05-12,6363732,Anastasiia,"Stayed company of 6 people from 9 to 11 May. District: a wonderful quiet neighborhood near the center of Stockholm. Near the house there is a supermarket. Apartment: Cute and very comfortable apartment. Has everything you need for a comfortable stay and even more. Moa is very hospitable, helpful and friendly. It was very pleasant to chat with her. Staying at Moa`s apartment made our holiday gorgeous!"
5623,822497,13476388,2014-05-28,7777122,Eddine,"We were four friends ans we stayed three nights. It is a very nice flat to stay for the short, for friends and family. The subway is not si for, 5 min and the area is calm.
Moa is friendly and a good adviser.
It was a great stay thanks to Moa and  the weather."
5624,822497,13908580,2014-06-08,11534531,Dina,"Moa's apartment is really amazing! It is comfortable, spacious, bright, warm and equipped with all necessary. Ideal for a company of 5 persons.The place is close to the metro station. The area around the apartment is quiet, peaceful and nice. Grocery store and cafes are close to the apartment.  Moa is hospitable and easy to communicate. We didn't have the pleasure to meet her,but she gave us some help with directions and tips on the city, also left us some coffee/tea and chocolate.
Thanks Moa for a wonderful stay. We would definitely recommend her apartment to anyone, and hope we'll be back!"
5625,822497,14113330,2014-06-12,10278241,Yunji,"Moa's place was very clean, modern, and comfortable. It's situated in a very residential area, about 20 min metro ride from the central station; trains run every 7 minutes during rush hour and less frequently in the evening. The metro station is about 5 mins walk from the place. There's also a bus station right around the corner, which is very convenient if you don't want to go through city center for all your activities. 

Moa left us plenty of space in the closet and refrigerator which helped us feel at home immediately. Check in and check out was very easy and her local shopping and dining recommendations were also helpful. There's a grocery store right next to the place, so we were able to cook up a nice breakfast before heading out each day. 

The only concern for us were her beds. Her beds are all on the soft side, so if you prefer firm beds, it may be uncomfortable. Also, the bed in the small bedroom is not a full double bed (little smaller than a US full size) so it's better for petite adults and children if you wanna have two people stay together. 

All in all it was a very pleasant stay and I would recommend Moa's place to friends who visit Stockholm in the future.  
"
5626,822497,14774623,2014-06-26,13450775,Samantha,"I stayed at Moa's apartment with a some of friends for a couple days and had nothing short of a pleasant experience.  The apartment itself was great, with all the amenities. Moa also went above and beyond, leaving detailed directions on places to go and checked in daily. I would definitely recommend staying here to anyone traveling to Stockholm. You'll most definitely enjoy your stay and you couldn't ask for a more gracious host. "
5627,822497,16016630,2014-07-20,16372787,Tsz Hin,This is really a great apartment for 6 of us. We have two nice days in stockholm with such a good place.
5628,822497,16882317,2014-08-04,11901305,Pascal,L'appartement est parfaitement situé. Il est très agréable et très calme. Pour  nous idéale pour passer quelques jours à Stockholm.
5629,822497,17737371,2014-08-17,12123733,Martine,"La description du logement est conforme et très fonctionnel, le quartier est très agréable et calme.
Il est à proximité du Métro donc très pratique pour se déplacer et visiter Stockholm. Pas besoin de véhicule.
Moa nous a conseillée quelques restaurants et bonnes adresses pour notre séjour que nous avons bien appréciés."
5630,822497,18518916,2014-08-28,9389031,Juan Luis,"We just loved the apartment, the location. It was perfect! We definitely would return, and urge anyone going to Stockholm to stay here. Thank you to Moa, she was very kind and helpful as well. We miss Stockholm already."
5631,822497,437200985,2019-04-14,250668923,Vendula,"The location is 5 minutes from the metro, the flat is so beautiful and comfortable and Moa is very nice person, recommended us some interesting places and she tried to make our trip great. Thanks."
5632,822497,451244350,2019-05-11,253775410,Jan,Everything was fine
5633,822497,457912596,2019-05-25,3681864,Ronni,Nice and clean appartment. Very cosy neighbourhood and perfect with small kids. Perfect communication!!
5634,822497,461350381,2019-05-31,21941114,Pauline,"Moa 's apartment had all we expected: spacious, well decorated, calm area at just 10-15 min from the city with the suburb which is just 5min walking from the apartment. Very easy To find! Moa was very hepfull before and during our stay. We highly recommend this apartment, and my bf 's 7yo daughter does too!  She absolutely loved it! Thank you Moa!"
5635,822497,477899256,2019-06-29,5024674,Lisa,"Moa’s apartment was perfect for our needs.  It is located just a short walk from the subway which easily got us to the center of Stockholm as well as the Central Station for day trips out of town.  There is also a grocery store within walking distance of the apartment.  The kitchen was well stocked with anything we needed and Moa generously encouraged us to use the spices and seasonings.  We also found the main bedroom to be comfortable.  There were just 2 of us, so we can’t comment on the other beds.  However, there was a second smaller bedroom which would allow privacy for additional travelers, and additional sleeping options in the living room.  We’ve had the experience of renting apartments that are cluttered with personal items, bric a brac, toiletries, etc.  However, Moa’s apartment was free of clutter, tastefully decorated, and allowed us to feel like the place was truly our own for our 10 day stay. Overall, we would recommend this apartment and will likely look to rent it again in the future!"
5636,822497,490752209,2019-07-19,39896438,Grace,Take the train. It is not difficult to find the apartment.  Do not take a taxi.  It is very expensive.
5637,822497,498042142,2019-07-29,115547951,Amanika,Moa’s  place is in a great location and she is so so helpful and kind. She’s quick to respond and is always willing to give advice. The place is clean and located close to the subway line ( a 5 min walk). We stayed with three kids in her place and there was plenty of room. Thank you Moa!!
5638,838442,65388220,2016-03-13,8247357,Tom,"Don't be fooled by the fact this place sits within a backpackers - if you're going with a handful of mates for a few days, you won't find a better & cheaper place.
Self-contained and centrally located, we'd happily go again. It's a 15-20min walk into Södermalm and close to the central train & bus station. 
The backpackers itself also has great shared facilities which was an added bonus....although the sauna is sadly shared, not private."
5639,838442,77766766,2016-06-03,60298645,Jerry,"First, the location is great and the people staying at the hostel were very nice.  However, I did not feel good about the experience.  First, the apartment pictured in the ad is not the apartment we received.   Second, the ad said it is a two bedroom apartment.  It was a one bedroom with four bunkbeds.  Third, the clothes washer pictured is not in your apartment.  It is in the basement of the building and accessible to everyone else staying in the building.  This means you can hang out in the basement and guard your clothes or you can skip using the laundry.   Fourth, the ""private sauna"" described and pictured in the ad is not in your apartment.  It is also in the basement of the building and, if I understood the instructions, turned on for one hour a day for men and one hour a day for women.  Fifth, after we were in Norway we received an email which said: ""I just want to be clear beforehand this apartment is part of our hostel ....""  The email then informed us that we would need to rent sheets and towels unless we brought your own.  If you really want to be perfectly clear about something, put that information in the ad before someone rents the place.   Sixth, this is a commercial establishment (hostel) advertising on Airbnb.  There is no host/guest relationship.  We were shown to our apartment by the clerk managing the front desk.  Summary:  Good location but not as advertised.     "
5640,838442,105924654,2016-10-03,25645916,Lieve,"Before our arrival the hostel was very flexible and answered all of my questions. The apartment is a nice size. It can be a little noisier since it's part of a hostel, but when you keep the window closed, it won't bother you. The atmosphere of the hostel is really nice, and the breakfast you can buy was great. Location is amazing, within 5-10 minutes (walking) you're in the busiest shoppingstreets of Stockholm. Lastly, as the other reviews said, the sauna and laundry room aren't part of the apartment, but don't let that deter you from renting this space. Me and my colleagues loved our stay here. "
5641,838442,114399248,2016-11-18,27102803,Karen,"My family and I greatly enjoyed staying at the apartment! The kitchen is equipped with all the necessary and is  well organized. The bunk beds are very practical and save lots of space. The adjacent hostel is a very welcoming structure, there is also a computer room where it is possible to print. My only complaint is that I was told the apartment was the one with sauna but it wasn't."

5650,838442,167801412,2017-07-08,108931898,Tim,"Great location, I liked the patio that was shared with a bar.  Note it is loud until 2300, which was fine by me but some people might not like it."

5657,838442,246414379,2018-03-25,47790408,Blandine,"The apartment is located inside a hostel but has its own private access. It was basic but clean and has confortable bunk beds. We were 5 and had enough space. The only issue is that the toilets are in the bathroom. Very centrally located, next to shops, restaurants and public transportation and within walking distance to all the main sightseeing spots in the city. Very welcoming staff."

The pub crawl was awesome! Thanks

The hostal provided us with free coffee and tea during the day and pasta, which was very nice. The atmosphere is pretty chill, and we felt very comfortable during our stay."

5669,838442,448386960,2019-05-05,113205162,Alessia,"Appartamento in centro in una posizione davvero ottima, dotato di sauna privata e tutto l'essenziale (lenzuola e salviette si noleggiano lì per 2/3€). Ospitalità ineccepibile e apprezzatissimo servizio di caffè, tè ed acqua gratuiti per gli ospiti dell'ostello (di cui l'appartamento fa parte). Molto carino anche il cortile comunitario dotato di lampade riscaldanti e coperte. Consigliatissimo!!"
5670,838442,457099529,2019-05-23,262438308,Jyon,Great place to stay. Staff is nice. You do have to pay for sheets and towels but very small amount.

5673,838442,469716993,2019-06-15,122038339,Tanja,Great place in Stockholm. Great location and great if you want to stay longer due to the kitchen in the apartment.
5674,838442,471309467,2019-06-17,60666325,Simon,Great hostel for group travel. Very pleasant and convenient.
5675,838442,473754401,2019-06-22,234680758,M.,"Eine sehr zentral gelegene Wohnung- die Altstadt ist ebenso fussläufig erreichbar wie der Hauptbahnhof (und via Alanda Express damit auch der Airport).
Wohnung hat individuellen Charme, da im Innenhof des Gebäudes gelegen, wo ein Restaurant betrieben wird- so hat man quasi vor der Haustür eine nette Kneipe (Laustärke war kein Problem).
Die Doppelstockbetten waren etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig, aber ok.
Hat Spass gemacht!"

The location is good, 6 min walk to the metro station and supermarkets. I recommend Michael's place."
5681,845365,33623264,2015-05-30,5241471,Amanda,"Had a great stay with Michael! The room and apartment are comfortable and cozy. A few minute walk from the train station. Michael was very nice, helpful, and easy to talk to! Not mention an overall cool guy. :)"
5682,845365,35669611,2015-06-21,23186307,Stevie,"My first time in Sweden, and I spent it here. Ideal location not far from metro or bus. I found this place to be full of hospitality, friendliness, and life. The only aspect that bummed me out was leaving! I recommend it."
5683,845365,36541542,2015-06-29,33173503,Bobby,"Michael was a very hospitable host. He was friendly and welcoming and gave us great tips on the hot spots in Sweden. The room itself was cosy and the location of the apartment is in close proximity to the metro. All-in-all, a great experience! Thanks Michael :)"
5684,845365,45589657,2015-09-04,5993119,Kimberly,"Michael was an incredible host!  He went out of his way to make sure we knew how to get to his place, and then graciously provided us with two bikes with which we were able to explore Stockholm (and avoid paying for public transit or crazy expensive bike rentals in the city!). 

Michael let us use his kitchen, and even offered us some delicious homemade soup.  He so sweetly offered to take us to his laundry room so we could do laundry.  Annnnd he entertained us the entire stay with us interesting banter.  Coolest host ever!"
5685,845365,47110038,2015-09-15,43323955,Sarah,"Micheal was an incredible host and made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived. He went above and beyond to accommodate our complicated travel arrangements (we'd both arrived from different places in europe and didn't get to the flat until late at night). The sleeping space was perfect and he even bought separate beds to replace the double especially for us! Other than that the house was what we described as 'beautifully busy' which so much fascinating installations and trinkets! He also has the BEST cups for tea and coffee fans! He went above and beyond to make sure our stay in Stockholm was as interesting as possible and even took us on walks around the local area to show us some of the best spots! Staying with him was like staying with family and we really feel like we've found a home away from home. We will most definitely be back!

Sarah & Faye"
5686,845365,47836408,2015-09-21,33675479,Ross,"Michael was an excellent host, friendly, welcoming and knowledgable about the area. An interesting guy with a cosy flat in a great location...."
5687,845365,48248824,2015-09-24,272852,Dan,"Michael was a fantastic host, more like visiting a friend than staying with a stranger. Plenty of power outlets, too, which was a nice change from many of the places I stay when traveling.

From pancakes the night I arrived to a quick tour of the local area to get myself oriented, Michael was incredibly accommodating and helpful. We also had a series of fantastic conversations on myriad topics over the course of my stay.

The room was cosy — great for one person, two if a couple, but might be a bit tight for three... I slept comfortably so no complaints :)

Be sure to check out the boat ride from a nearby stop, and the cafe with views over the water a 5-10 minute walk away."
5688,845365,48779895,2015-09-28,1864121,Charlotte,"Michael is a gracious host! He showed us around when we got there and we enjoyed tea and conversation with him. He is an eccentric and very friendly guy who enjoys talking. The room is comfortable, he has a unique plant and fish ecosystem going in the kitchen area. It is near the metro station, about half an hour from Stockholm. Metro tickets are expensive so he loans guests bikes which is nice!"
5689,845365,54853007,2015-11-25,42707078,Billy,i was 10 days at Michael home! i feel like i was in my home .! he was friendly and help full ! i dont have any bad comments ! i recommend to everybody :) !
5690,845365,55421285,2015-12-01,46453874,Sabrina,We had a very nice and relaxed stay at Michaels home. The room was comfy and quiet – the perfect place to relax if you come back from sightseeing. Michael was always attentive and helpful and open for a chat. He also gave as bikes to drive into the city! :)
5691,845365,57240355,2015-12-23,50261675,Erjalda,"Michael was a great host. Very helpful and patient with my many requests. He really made me and my pregnant wife specially welcome. I have never been so well taken of as by Michael. Thank you, Michael. You are the best!"
5692,845365,58980311,2016-01-05,25598155,Alexander,"Michael is a great host! We are happy that met such a kind and intelligent person in our trip! His flat is very creative and it looks like concept design museum with million simple things that are in perfect order.

Good transport communication to the center. Two big supermarkets 5 minutes far from the house. Wonderful forest 5 minutes from the house.

Highly recommended!"
5693,845365,59553400,2016-01-11,45373357,Nacho,"Michael really saved my day! He answered really quick, and everything was perfect. He has been always asking me if everything is OK, and offering himself for everything. Without a doubt, one of the better host that I ever had!

Michael me salvó el día! Respondió muy rápido y todo estaba perfecto. Siempre se ha interesado en que todo estuviese bien y se ofrecía siempre para ayudarme. Sin duda, uno de los mejores anfitriones que he tenido!"
5694,845365,60064576,2016-01-18,51586492,Matthew,"Michael is easy to get along with and talk to. He does his utmost to make your stay comfortable, even through his busy lifestyle. The house is well equipped and the room is spacious. So much so, in fact, that I would say the room is the most spacious place in the house! 
The house is the 4 large apartment buildings away from the train station - about 5 minute walk. It is also a 15 minute walk from the Lake. Fantastic Area. Enjoyable stay. Would definitely return when I'm back in Sweden. I recommend him to the point where I have already arranged for friends to also stay with him."
5695,845365,67921332,2016-04-01,39002805,Akshay,I stayed in Michael's apartment for one month. Michael and his wife were very friendly and helping. On my day of arrival Michael's wife Aleza picked me up from the metro station in her car and gave me nice snacks and tea. I enjoyed talking to Michael about various things. He is a very nice and gentle person.  Apartment was very comfortable and well equipped.  It is very nearby to the Bredäng metro station and ICA grocery store (roughly 500 meters).  I used to cook my own food and i have no difficulty.  Over all It was a great experience to stay there.
5696,845365,69664409,2016-04-12,21037483,Wim,Michael is really a great host ... Staying there is then also more like staying at a friend ... Very relaxed and easy going ;-)
5697,845365,70940437,2016-04-22,21889842,Piers,"Michael was quite nice and interesting to talk to. It's a good spot as there are multiple supermarkets nearby and the metro station is very close making getting into the city very easy. 
It is mentioned in the description but note the room does not look like that in the picture. Overall it was a good place to stay, my only issue being it was cluttered. The apartment was packed to overflowing with stuff which you don't see in the photos."
5698,845365,71695543,2016-04-27,36563422,Zouhair,"Très bon accueil... correspond à la description... situation idéale
Très bon rapport qualité/prix 
A recommander"
5699,845365,75426617,2016-05-21,65441018,Elise,"Michael's place is a metro ride away from the city, very convenient and easy to navigate after you've done it once! The apartment is small and sound travels throughout, but there is plenty of room in the bedroom (with a very comfortable bed as a bonus). We also enjoyed the natural area and Thai restaurant across the way when we were too tired to go back into Stockholm.  "
5700,845365,123874295,2016-12-31,100256379,Feng,Nice people. Easy contact:). Friendly. The place is very warm to the heart !

Michael made sure I was as comfortable as I could be, always checking up on me and making sure I was alright.  he is very well learned and knowledgeable a person and it is interesting listening to him speak. Thanks again Michael!! "
5704,845365,266047062,2018-05-19,53854340,Samet,"Michael is a very welcoming friendly person and really a super host. The room was clean and comfortable. There were all the tools and machines for cooking, so I felt like I was in my home. The bathroom and the toilet were clean and servicing.
Thank you, Michael !"
5705,845365,271752244,2018-06-02,128019882,Jim,"Michael had recently returned from travelling and was busy and my booking was short notice. Even so, he was a very accommodating and helpful host. His tip to take go to take the bus to the airport from Liljeholmen station, rather than return to central station, was spot on. There's a small restaurant near his apartment open late serving things like pizza and kebab - really nice when I returned late (late just being around 12:00 or 1:00 in this case) and hungry. "
5706,845365,288236565,2018-07-09,122251162,James,"Michael’s delightfully Bohemian & a bit eccentric, which is what makes AirBnB so much fun!  You get to interact with real people in the local community, not corporate facades. He was quite helpful & an excellent conversationalist. The room is fairly small but comfortable & in easy proximity to a train station and bike paths. Good stay overall!"
5707,854975,3407026,2013-01-24,4544381,Henrik,"Sergej and his friend Michael provided me with a great stay in Stockholm. Nice flat, clean, great location, very nice furnitures/TV and equipment in the flat not to mention the really good communication with Sergej and Michael. Do I need to say I really recommend Sergej's falt for anyone who's considering a visit to Stockholm.

Overall - outstanding accommodation!!

Enjoy,
Henrik"
5708,854975,4456534,2013-05-06,4690301,Eric,Sergej's apartment is very nice with easy access to the bus from the airport and the Odenplan T-Bana station (although it is a short walk into the center of town).  Sergej was very attentive and was always available in case we had issues.  He even left us with a little guide to the apartment as well as Stockholm hotspots.  Would stay there again next time in Stockholm!
5709,854975,4526284,2013-05-10,235496,Paola & Isak,Excellent host and apartment! We warmly recommend him to the AirBnB community!
5710,854975,4574871,2013-05-13,5889935,Stéphanie,"Sergej's apartment is very nice, clean and well located in Stockholm. Very close to the bus station to Airport and the subway.
The balcony is great to enjoy the breakfast under the morning sun :)
The communication with Sergej was perfect before and during our travel.
We highly recommend Sergej's apartment to all those who want to spend good time in Stockholm!
"
5711,854975,4764689,2013-05-24,4113472,Dave,"This is a fantastic apartment in a great part of Stockholm.  Very accessible with the metro only two blocks away.  The apartment is clean and quiet.  

Sergej is a wonderful host, very detailed and helpful with any needs.  Highly recommend"
5712,854975,4988344,2013-06-05,6567767,Loïc,"Sergej nous a loué un appart situé dans le quartier d'Odenplan et très bien desservi par les transports en commun, à quelques blocs de la gare centrale.
Si vous devez loger à 3, n'hésitez pas à lui demander un matelas supplémentaire (conseil d'ami ;)).
Stockholm est une ville très agréable à taille humaine qui se visite en 3-4 jours. Aussi, n'hésitez pas à bouger vers Malmö par exemple..."
5713,854975,5167439,2013-06-16,6652628,Paola,"The apt was clean and comfortable, easy to the city center (only 2 km walking and 5 min with the tube). Sited in a very quite area, no traffic or neighbors noises. Sergej was very friendly and helpful, but also very discreet. I recommend this apt to people wishing to visit Stockholm or people like me who went to Stockholm for work and did not find place in the hotel. Only one remark, the bed is not huge so if you are not quite thin it could be a bit uncomfortable for two people (no problem for one p), on the other hand the sofa is very huge so I think you can sort it out. definetely, I recommend this apt!"
5714,854975,5800285,2013-07-16,7393301,David,"Sergej is a great host! It was our first time using Airbnb and we had an amazing time. Sergej had also provided us with a list of things to see and do in stockholm which was great and helped us out. He was also there to answer any questions we had during our stay. 

Apartment was clean, comfortable and only a short walk to the city or transport. As per the description it would fit 2 people comfortably (we had 3 and it was still fine).

Most importantly, Sergej accepted us on extremely late notice (we contacted him a few hours before we were due to arrive)

I'd recommend this apartment to anyone =)"
5715,854975,6669208,2013-08-20,1428601,Ted,Apartment was awesome! Close to metro and Odenplan.
5716,854975,6992677,2013-09-02,7823735,Juan,"Great experience! Sergej took great care of me even though I arrived and left at obnoxious hours. The wifi was *fast* which is essential for me, and the bed was comfy. And sitting outside on the beanbags was awesome. They are partly covered by the balcony above so I was able to sit there even in light rain.

Anyway, this was my first time using AirBnB and it was so good to have a real apartment, with fridge, kitchen, etc, instead of a hotel.

The location is excellent, with much of Stockholm accessible by walk. Loved exploring from here."
5717,854975,7654228,2013-09-28,1266253,Alessandro,"Sergej's apartment is lovely, clean and in a great location. I spent two weeks in the apartment and I almost felt like at home.

Sergej is a super friendly guy, he was always available and immensely helpful in those two weeks. Definitely recommend staying at his place."
5718,854975,8261878,2013-10-22,3984005,Eric,"Sergej has been a great host! Right after our arrival, he already got in touch with us and provided us with really helpful information on how to get from the airport to the apartment. On our arrival, he showed us the basics of his apartment and also had a guest manual with some recommendations for exploring Stockholm. The communication with him has always been very friendly, uncomplicated & clear.

The apartment itself is located about 5 minutes walking distance from the Odenplan. It is fully furnished, has a nice balcony and everything you need for a Stockholm trip.

We enjoyed it a lot and will definitely come back again! Thank you for an unforgettable stay!"

Very comfortable to rest after a day of visit. Clean and practical.
Don't have a lots of more comments to do, I would simply recommend it !"
5720,854975,13215058,2014-05-22,14068949,Pierre,"Nous avons passé 6 jours à Stockholm, et c’était notre première expérience avec airbnb. Nous en revenons enchantés. L'appartement de Sergej correspond exactement à la description: très confortable pour deux personnes, très calme, dans un quartier agréable à 15mn à pied du centre. Avec les cartes citybike mises à la disposition par notre hôte, nous avons pu profiter des vélos (station tout proche).
Sergej a depuis le début de notre inscription répondu rapidement et efficacement à toutes nos questions. A notre arrivée, n'étant pas lui même à Stockholm, tout était prévu pour nous rassurer: Sergej était en contact avec nous par sms et pour l'entrée dans l'appartement: un ami à lui était présent. Des rafraichissement, le petit déjeuner, le linge de toilette et la literie étaient prévus pour notre confort.
Un grand merci à Sergej, notre seul regret étant de ne pas avoir eu la chance de le rencontrer. Peut être une autre fois!"
5721,854975,13572413,2014-05-31,7074272,Mike,"Sergej's apartment really made for a wonderful stay in Stockholm. The apartment is tidy and has a fully equipped kitchen, shower with great water pressure, black out blinds for the summer sun, and a comfy bed. The bed was a little small for two people so we ended up taking turns sleeping on the couch instead but there are extra blankets and pillows for you to do so. Sergej left us a welcome packet with tips for exploring the city and where to find everything in the apartment and even bought us milk, orange juice, and knackebrod (a typical Swedish breakfast) to make us feel at home. Moreover, the apartment is only 5 minutes walk from the Odenplan metro station and the city bike cards he left for us were a huge plus! I would fully recommend Sergej's place."
5722,854975,13811715,2014-06-05,12108665,John,"lovely flat - comfortable, everything worked properly, and a powerful shower!

We were met by a friend of Sergej and found a fully equipped and clean apartment. The bike passes were a real treat! Absolutely recommendable and we'll definitely be back!"
5724,854975,18451029,2014-08-26,1518514,Collin,"I was in a real pinch in Copenhagen and was looking for very last minute accommodations in Stockholm. Sergej was the only guy willing to help me out and I really appreciated it.

Sergej was a great host. He was super accommodating and helpful, especially considering how short-notice the trip was. He left some good suggestions for places to go and things to see and do, which was very considerate and helpful if you don't know someone who lives in the city.

Place was great. Close to transport and some nightlife spots. It's quiet, comfortable, clean, and looks just like the photos. Everything a single traveller could ask for."
5725,854975,19470638,2014-09-13,3351558,Mikhail,"I was visiting Stockholm for a conference at the Karolinska Institute and Sergej's apartment proved to be a real treat. In a great part and well-connected part of town, in a beautiful building with a courtyard and a sunny balcony.  Sergej himself was very welcoming and accommodating, always quick to respond to my text messages and happy for me to check out rather late on my last day. Will look no further whenever I need to be back!"
5726,854975,20881138,2014-10-06,10622642,Douglas,he was extremely helpful and accommodating. We arrived at a very late hour (just after midnight) and he still was able to let out his place.  
5727,854975,21844861,2014-10-25,22272337,Carlos,"Sergej was such a pleasure to work with. I asked to him for an iron and a table iron,  and he made arrangement to get it. He was very welcoming, when I arrived he even get me the breakfast for the next day, maps, information, cards for metro,bus and bike, even simcards. He really went above and beyond to accommodate me. 
Thanks for everything. "
5728,854975,23870461,2014-12-13,22272337,Carlos,"This is the third time I have been in their apartment and for sure, If I came back to Stockholm again, I will reserve it again. This winter it was a little cold so he has an extra electric radiator that works perfect for this season.  The location is perfect and close to the bus stop 69 that takes you around the city."
5729,854975,520593830,2019-08-30,178128946,Daria,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

Definitely a happy choice for staying in Stockholm."

The room was spacious and the bathroom well appointed.  The location is in an elegant neighborhood of quiet streets and parks and restaurants scattered about.  It was about three blocks from the metro and easy to get around the  city.  I also used the laundry facility in the basement.

This airb&b is situated in the best part of the town, ostermalm. You get offered a spacy place where you can easily be at yourself organised with very good facilities.
It is definitely a place where you find hospitality and a warm welcome.
Go there and enjoy! - Stef"

She has basic house rules of common sense. Follow those and you will enjoy her hospitality to the maximum extent. Wi-fi connection is fast and stable. The neighbourhood is nice and close to public transportation. The room (and the flat) is clean and well lit. The bed is comfortable. During my stay, I felt like I was at home. Recommended without any hesitation. "

5741,858902,26450312,2015-02-13,2060397,Christiane,"The communication before my visit with Lotta was very easy and clear. I was very warmly welcomed by her daughter Beatrice and her adorable dog Lola. The room looks just like the pictures and was - like the rest of the appartment - very clean. It had a big build-in wardrobe and closet, so lots of space to store my cloths. I found the plastic box very convenient to store my hygiene products and carry them to the shower.

Lotta provided me a area in the fridge, where I could leave my food. The Wifi is very fast and absolutely stable. Several bus and subway stations are just around the corner - the location couldn't be any better. I highly recommend this room - especially when you prefer privacy and quitness."

Lottas Appartement ist in einer sehr schönen ruhigen Gegend, das Stadtzentrum ist zu Fuß in 15 Minuten zu erreichen. Das Appartement ist sehr sauber und schön eingerichtet. Das Zimmer ist ebenso schön und angenehm eingerichtet. Leider hat das W-Lan im Zimmer nicht sehr gut funktioniert. Dennoch ein toller Aufenthalt!"

She provided me with every information to get easy to her apartment. When I arrived, Lotta welcomed me very warm and had a lot of advices for sightseeings, do's and don't do's (how to avoid all the big tourist groups :-)) and restaurants for me. So that I didn't feel like a tourist. The room is very cosy, clean and after a day full of sightseeing you can feel very comfortable.

Would definitely come back :)"

We had a great time at Arne's place. Though we never met him in person,  the communication was excellent before and during our stay.
The house is clean and cosy and has a charming garden.
The kitchen is very well equipped and the parking situation in front of the house is relaxed.
We would highly recommend Arne's place to anyone!"
5767,862528,6560698,2013-08-17,1221090,Thomas,"Arne and Katinka gave us a warm welcome and some helpful tips for our stay. They organized a crib and a high chair for our friend's baby.
The house is located in a really nice neighbourhood with a supermarket, subway station and a huge playground (for small and big kids) just around the corner. The motorway is near so you're in Stockholm in about 20-25 minutes.
The house is great, but the main bedroom has no doors to the living room downstairs and is a walk through room to the second bedroom/nursery. That might be no problem for one family with kids, but for two couples it's not ideal. Anyways we had a great time at Arne's and Katinka's place and really enjoyed our stay!

Thanks,
Thomas"
5768,862528,15452319,2014-07-09,5704038,Annu,"This Villa is beautiful in green and quiet recidental area with good connection to The centre of Stockholm. Next corner there is nice park for kids, supermarket, restaurant, beach and tunnelbana station are near. Free parking for car. Big terraces to eat outside and enjoy the Swedish summer. The owner is flexible and nice. We got all the gears for the baby and found lots of toys to play. The house was a bit messy especially the kitchen. There was not much space to hang clothes or keep our things. In the bedroom there is lot of light because of the roof window. It was difficult to get sleep. Bed is very comfortable. After all  we stayed well and enjoyed our Holliday."

The house is fine for a family and Arne fixed a bed in the small room designed for a small children for one of our teens.
We didn’t meet Arne, but it was very easy to communicate with him if needed.
We go quite often to Stockholm and in Sweden and we willingly keep the spot for a next trip (winter is a nice season to visit the city but we couldn’t appreciate the terraces to eat, sunbathing and rest!)"

Spacious living room, bed room and outside garden was all making a fantastic stay for 2 families with 2 young kids. Arne kept everything in a convenient place, with an excellent welcome note explaining things about the house and the neighborhood. We had a wonderful barbeque & cycling session too in the backyard. Would love to have such apartments and hosts wherever we travel. 7 star host & the apartment."

Nach Stockholm kann man bequem mit der Metro fahren. Der Kontakt zu Arne war sehr gut (via SMS/Mail), die Schlüsselübergabe funktionierte bestens. Wir fühlten uns sehr willkommen, vielen Dank!!!"

The house is well-located for a journey in Stockholm area, 15mn from the city by car and close to a metro station direct to the centre. Arne was hère to welcome us and showed us kindly and quickly all what to know about the house.
The house is extremely pleasant, nicely decorated  and very convenient for à Family with its garden and its two terraces, a large living-room and opened cuisine, the 3.bedrooms and bathrooms... Arne arranged us a crib and a high chair. The Nespresso machine, the Netflix access were nice bonus. Everything went extremely well, except maybe the unconfortable king-size bed (too soft for us)... We highly recommand Arne and his house for your future stay in Stockholm!!

We didn't expect that. The house was very comfortable, we really liked the interior and the veranda as the weather was super for sitting outside. Our children were happy with the WiFi ;-). Communication with Arne is excellent. He quickly replied on all your questions. Very helpful host."

Sauber und geschmackvoll eingerichtet.
Sonnige Terrassen zum Ausruhen nach langen Tagen in der Stadt, in 5 Mintuen zu Fuß bei der T- Bana und immer ein freier Parkplatz vor der eigenen Haustür.
Nette, schnelle und zuverlässige Kommunikation mit Arne.
Wir würden Arnes Haus wieder mieten, wenn wir nach Stockholm zurückkommen!  "

Eingerichtet in einem lässigen skandinavischen Stil haben wir uns total wohl gefühlt. Das Viertel ist eine ruhige Siedlung mit hübschen Holzhäusern, ein paar Minuten von der U-Bahn entfernt, von dort aus ist man in 15 min in Gamla Stan. Gleich um die Ecke ist ein schöner Spielplatz, zum Wasser mit Bademöglichkeiten läuft man knapp 20 min. Im Haus war alles, was man brauchte, bei Fragen antwortete Arne immer prompt und unkompliziert. Wir haben die Woche in Arnes Haus sehr genossen und können es sehr empfehlen!"

5781,862868,17667804,2014-08-16,9074557,Joshua,"Pernilla was an extraordinary host, both responsive and welcoming.

The apartment was spotless and fully-furnished, and was home to an impressive personal library (including a few on Stockholm). Great lighting throughout, and in the rear of the building lies a private, tree-lined courtyard. 

The building is surrounded by array of shops, restaurants and cafes—with an Espresso House around the corner, opening soon! The tunnelbana is directly across the street, and T-Centralen only a stop away.

This was my first experience with AirBnB, and couldn't have been happier. I'd recommend Pernilla's apartment without hesitation.
"
5782,862868,43032553,2015-08-17,30902159,Jason,"I never actually met Pernilla, but our communication was excellent prior to my stay. I arrived and received the keys with no issues whatsoever. The location of the apartment is perfect, literally right outside of a subway station and with major bus routes 1 or 2 minutes away. This area of Kungsholmen became my favorite part of Stockholm, in the city but with a more neighborhood feel.

As for the apartment itself...absolutely perfect. It's a studio, so it's small of course, but there was an amazing ""a place for everything and everything in its place"" vibe. I stayed for 4 weeks but never had to contact Pernilla as everything I possibly could have needed was there, and her written instructions for things like laundry and garbage/recycling were spot on. It was a wonderful AirBnB stay, and I definitely would have stayed longer if the place had been available."
5783,862868,56417394,2015-12-13,49871373,René,"Nice and cozy appartment right in the center of town. If you like walking, quite everything is within walking distance! We actually never used the public transport, exept to and from the airport.

Supermarkets and several restaurants within 3 minutes.
Arriving very late on a saturday evening we appreciated very much that next-morning's breakfast had been made available in the fridge.

René and Wilma."
5784,862868,64197376,2016-03-01,3000168,Lauren,"I stayed in Pernilla's apartment for one month, while in Stockholm for work. Prior to arrival, Pernilla was easy to communicate with and quick to respond. My arrival date was a few days before she was scheduled to leave but she accommodated my stay anyway so I could come straight to the apartment from the airport, which was very helpful so I did not have to find a second place for those few days. 
Upon arrival she showed me around the apartment and the building, suggested some highlights of the neighborhood, and let me know she had left some breakfast food and tea in the kitchen to get me started. However, even if she had not been there to show me around, there were detailed written instructions left on the counter.
The apartment itself was perfect for me. It is ideal for one person with everything needed for a long stay like mine. The kitchen is equipped with dishes, pots/pans, utensils, etc. and has a dishwasher but no microwave, so food must be heated in the oven. Everything worked properly and was easy to use.  The apartment is setup in a functional way so that, even if it appears small at first, all the spaces are utilized well giving the sense of a larger apartment. Also, there was space cleared in the closet and bathroom so I could store my things.
The building has an elevator, however, the apartment is on the top floor and the elevator arrives one floor below with stairs that lead to the apartment one flight up. This was not a problem for me, but maybe good to know if you have a lot of luggage or trouble with stairs. I also did not have problems scheduling and using the laundry room which is in another building. 
The location was also perfect. It is directly across the street from a metro entrance, only one stop from Stockholm Central Station where it is possible to transfer to any other train line. There is also a full grocery store on the same block that is open late and very convenient. Although there are shops, restaurants, banks, etc. nearby, the apartment is not too far from the waterfront where there is a trail for walking along the water (and Stockholm is beautiful any time of year). "
5785,866768,100900730,2016-09-11,17142087,Lena,"Our trip to Stockholm was amazing!
Sally was really nice, she hosted us very spontaneous, because we wrote her a day before we arrived. But it was no problem. And she was waiting for us a long time, because our train was delayed. She was really friendly! Her apartment is also very cozy.

The location is good, a safe place and you can walk to Södermalm in 20 minutes. To walk to the old town or downtown it's too far. But you can easily take the metro, it's very close! 

For the location and the apartment the price is perfect! I can really recommend Sally's apartment."
5786,866768,102531456,2016-09-18,69707180,Jordan,Sally was incredibly helpful and hospitable. an excellent host!

The apartment is clean, cozy and in great condition and was just a 7 minute walk to the nearst tube. Very accessible by public transport and with a supermarket very close, the apartment is in a quiet lovely area with trees right outside. Perfect for a working week away for me.  Would definitely come back! Thanks so much. "
5788,866768,110254131,2016-10-25,94684379,Francois,"Sally was very kind and sweet on arrival and departure, totally flexible to accommodate your schedule; her flat is truly cosy, very comfortable and very nicely decorated, about 10mn on foot from the nearest subway stop, on a line that takes you directly to the heart of Stockholm and its transport hub in 10mn, and with a bus stop less than 1mn walk from the apartment to take you to the subway if you don't want to walk . Highly recommended!"
5789,866768,157673510,2017-06-04,45381107,Chevy,I enjoyed staying at Sally's place. It is close to public transportation. 
5790,866768,188033613,2017-08-28,11674168,Ari,Sally's apt was in a great location for accessing all the tourist spots in Stockholm. It was actually bigger than it looks in the photos---very cool place. She was a kind and helpful host and gave me some great suggestions for seeing the city.

5796,871262,5755579,2013-07-15,2085916,Ece,"Lotta's home is fantastically located in a residential area if you want a quiet base close to all the visit-worthy sites in Stockholm (museums, parks/gardens, shopping, really good restaurants) . It takes not more than 5mins walk to Saluhall for breakfast/lunch, 10mins leisurely walk to Djurgardens and 6-7mins leisurely walk to boats/ferries to explore the other islands. Other forms of public transportation are all within 4-5mins of a pleasant walk amongst mostly residential buildings. 
Lotta herself is a lovely lady who was barely around, but a pleasure to talk to when our schedules crossed. Helpful, welcoming and easy-going were my impressions.
The flat itself was warm, clean and cozy- exactly what one is looking for a city exploration trip. I would truly recommend it to anyone. I really had a fantastic time in Stockholm- mostly because of Lotta's flat.  "
5797,871262,6309623,2013-08-07,7565272,Fezeh,"Lotta's place was just a perfect choice to live in, and Lotta in herself is a very cheerful lady. The grocery stores and restaurants were just a couple of minutes walk away and so are the tunnel bana and bus stations. The room is  nice and cozy equipped with all the necessary things. A very pleasent experience to stay with her. "

5807,871262,14690382,2014-06-24,2897470,Francois,Great place in Ostermalm which is the wealthier part of Stockholm. Very short walk to the metro which gives you access to the rest of the city. The apartment itself was very clean and looked just like the description. Lotta was very accommodating and even helped me settle in and suggest plenty of things to do around the city. Would definitetly look into staying here again the next time I am in Stockholm.
5808,871262,15464158,2014-07-09,14335087,Anne,"A pretty room in a beautiful appartment, located in a quiet upper class district of Stockholm. Some essential rules about noise and privacy to respect, which seems logical to anyone who share one's home. The adress is at few minutes from metro, shops and 20mn by walk from the main sites of the city (Gamla Stan, Soder', Central Station, Djurgarden...) And as you want to be as healthy as swedish people, you walk!
Lotta has been adorable, very helpful, and answering any of my questions, giving essential advices and good adresses when I came.
A really nice stay for me, who was working and visiting. Thanks for everything."
5809,871262,16174456,2014-07-22,17297647,Oliver,"Lotta is a great hostess. She has so many information and tips about Stockholm and also areas further away. You should definitely make use of her guidance.
The 'small' room is absolutely ok, everything is clean, neat and as described.
The same time as me another airbnb guest stayed in the huge flat but I didn't hear anything of him, we only met twice in the hallway.
As I was there on a weekend, I could easily park my car in front of the house."

The area is very nice, with old beautiful buildings. The flat is on the 4th floor, and give you much light and view of the streets. The room I lived in was very nice, useful furnitures and a comfortable bed. 

I can really recommend this place when visiting Stockholm."
5814,871262,42934427,2015-08-16,31976676,Stefan,"I agree with those who say good things about Lotta and
her place, the location, the room, the bed etc.  However, I did not push the More+
link in the amenities part of Lotta’s Airbnb page online before I booked (my mistake)
and therefore I did not see that there is no kitchen access. I see this as a drawback when you are staying for ten days, as I did."
5815,871262,44456949,2015-08-26,2701624,Christine,"L'appartement de Lotta est vaste et chaleureux, on s'y sent totalement indépendant et libre d'aller et venir.

The room is very nice as well, having your own key and being able to come and go gave me the flexibility to see the city and take breaks as need be. The shared shower was handled very well (Lotta gives a small plastic container for your shower stuff, so the shower is not crowded and you don't forget anything). Towels were provided as well!"
5818,871262,74899276,2016-05-17,45377724,Naghmeh,I had a lovely time staying at Lotta's apartment. She was very welcoming and accommodating.

Nice location, close to centre, with bars and restaurants nearby. Lotta is an excellent and welcoming host who keeps to herself but makes the stay very pleasant. Just be sure you're okay with the rules: no check-in after 10 pm, no showers after 10 pm (for noise reasons). If you're happy with those rules, it's an excellent choice, highly recommended!"
5822,871262,100089783,2016-09-07,82217918,Sydney,"Lotta has a wonderful apartment in an amazing part of Stockholm. Her instructions of how to get to/in her building didn't get to me the first time around so I had some troubles finding her initially. Her apartment is very clean, quiet and comfortable. If you want a quiet stay with little interaction from your host then you should book here. If you want a bit more going on, then maybe look into something else. I do wish she allowed me use of her kitchen (even just to store perishables and not cook) or laundry (ONE laundromat in all of Stockholm).   "
5823,871262,105846853,2016-10-03,19792591,Pernilla,"Lotta made me feel very welcome, we had good contact beforehand about my time of arrival which was nice. I came for work but Lotta gave supplied a lot of flyers and booklets about Stockholm which were very fun to read during the evenings. Also, she drew interesting places for me to visit on a map. Then there were even clan towels on the bed. The bed was very comfortable and from the room you have  a great view of the street. The apartment is located in a beautiful building and is decorated nicely and makes you feel at home.  In the neighbourhood there is a 7eleven and a coop for groceries. It's very close to the waterside wehere the Grand Hotel is, and about 10 minutes walk to either City/ Castle / Skepsholmen.  Although I came for work, I had a very pleasant stay that felt like a holiday. "

The room and the rest of the apartment were very clean. Lotta is a very nice host. She gave me a lot of interesting information about the city in the beginning and was always avaible when I had questions. I can really recommend this room.

Extremely nice and available to help you with anything. The room is big and sunny, only 5 minutes walk from Hagsätra station where there are some convenient shops open till late.

Isabelle gave clear directions to the house, showed to me everything I need, we chatted in the evening a bit )

It will take you 45 minutes to get from the Arlanda Airport by bus to T-Centralen and then to Isabelle's house by metro. 
From the centre of Stokholm this is 20 minutes by metro. 

A nice place to stay if you find the altrenative to the expensive Sweden hotels and crowded hostels). "

The apartment was clean, and comfortably furnished. There were two points of access to public transportation (tunnelbana and bus), both about 5-8 minutes walk from the apartment, as well as a few restaurants and grocery stores.

I would definitely recommend staying with her for anybody thinking about visiting Stockholm."
5841,873383,43489118,2015-08-20,34197256,Anthony,"Isabelle et Dan ont été des hôtes fantastique, voir l'hôte parfait. Je suis partit seul en vacances à Stockholm pendant 12 jours. Isabelle a toujours été là pour me conseiller:
-quelles activités je pouvais faire 
-quels lieux à visiter. 
Dès que je posait une question elle s'empressait de se renseigner si le lieu était ouvert, si oui combien était l'entrer etc. etc.

De plus, elle m'a proposer de l'accompagner à plusieurs reprise afin de prendre un ""Fika"" (""apéro"") avec ces amis. 

L'appartement, en plus d'être très propre et bien équipés (TV, wifi, netflix etc..) il est aussi très bien situé, à une centaine de mètre de la station de métro. Il faut compter environ 15-20 min jusqu'au centre de Stockholm. Chaque matin Isabelle proposait un copieux déjeuner, selon les envies que je pouvais avoir. 

Je ne peux que recommander Isabelle si vous souhaitez avoir un séjour à Stockholm. C'est l'hôte idéal qui fait tout pour que l'on se sente à l'aise et chez soit :)"

Ich wurde vom Bahnhof abgeholt und bei der Abreise bis zum Zug begleitet, habe Info-Materialien und tolle Tips für Stockholm bekommen, wurde einigen Freunden vorgestellt und zu Aktivitäten / Festivitäten mitgenommen - so konnte ich das alltägliche Stockholm erleben, was mir sehr gut gefallen hat. Das Zimmer ist schön groß, sauber und grenzt an den Wald, was eine schöne Abwechslung ist zur Stadt tagsüber. Auch war Isabelle sehr interessiert an meinen positiven Erfahrungen und Entdeckungen, um sie an zukünftige Gäste weitergeben zu können. Ich habe mich sehr wohl gefühlt (auch die Nachbarschaft ist ruhig und angenehm) und kann Jedem nur empfehlen, hier zu übernachten! "

5849,873383,66013671,2016-03-18,5138598,Maddie,Isabelle was a great host. She was quick to respond to my last min request and was able to meet me in town on her way home. Her apartment is well located with a very short walk to the metro. The room was a good size with a comfortable bed. Isabelle was great about any questions I had and I enjoyed getting to know her and her cats over the few days I was in Stockholm.

The apartment was clean and cosy and she is a very easy going person. We hope that we didnt cause much inconvenience to her. We would recommend her place to those who wish to explore stockholm!"
5853,873383,77436243,2016-05-31,69160412,Lucia,"Isabelle is a great host, she is responsive and helpful. She helped us with everything (including the arrival from the airport to the City and her flat, she advised us the places that we should see in the city, etc.). Her appartment is very clean as you can see in the pictures. Isabelle is an easy-going person and I definitely recommend to stay at her appartment if you want to go to Stockholm and if you want to feel like you are at home. :) "
5854,873383,78491949,2016-06-07,73954287,Eileen,"Isabelle is a kind and generous host.  She is very communicative and will make you feel very welcome during your stay.   Her apartment was very colorful and well-decorated, and very clean.  It's a quick, quiet walk to the T station, and it takes less than half an hour to central Stockholm.  
And Isabelle has two really amazing cats.
I would highly recommend to anybody visiting Stockholm."

The apartment is located far from Stockholm, but public transportation makes the trip easy. 
If you are attending an event at Stockholmsmässen, then the room is perfect as you can follow a calm, quiet path to arrive at the venue."
5858,873383,91133763,2016-08-04,54818319,蓓蓓,"Hi firstly, I should attend to express my apologizes to Isabelle for my late arrival the first night.Because after we arrive the airport,we are looking for the place saling Stockholm card in airport and waiting for buses to metro.We thought the card could include metro but actually it is not.We continued to search where we can buy metro card,it waste a lot of time for we have no cash but credit card.So when we arrive Isabella home,it is late she had already fallen asleep.We would like all the hosts inNorth Europe to know,for our Chinese,the expense in your country is so expensive for us,even we had a not bad salary inChina,especially for transportation and foods,so we must make calculations and comprision,choose a economic route to save money so that we can have more time and chance to look around your country while it would waste much time at first.That might be called culture (Website hidden by Airbnb) I extend my apologies to Isabella to postpone her time and I will grasp my time and give proper time to the host.Please understand us too.Thank you!Isabelle home is in the south area of Stockholm,about ten minutes metro time to the central area.It is convinient.She is patient and would like answer all my questions.Thank her host in Stockholm and wish her a good life!"
5859,873383,94849130,2016-08-17,32917285,Robert,"Peaceful and quiet environment, not far from the metro station.

He makes a fight for you of ""their five minutes"" caressing, scratching, loud will thank you and then fell asleep."

The pictures are only a glimpse of the beauty and comfort her place offers. She made me feel right at home from the first day through her willingness to share. The location was beautiful and perfect in distance from the city center. 

As this was a business trip Isabelle was really helpful. Sharing insights on Stockholm and its culture, along with events and introductions to people. I'm happy to say that I have a new friend in Sweden
"
5865,873383,112881564,2016-11-08,2354743,Sabine & Jan,I can highly recommend staying with Isabelle and her funny cat. The apartment is cozy and the neighborhood is quiet and friendly. She also has good tips where to go and what to do in Stockholm. The subway is a short walk away and and connects you to the city conveniently.

5868,873383,131712294,2017-02-13,63567959,Valentina,"The apartment is cosy, the mattress is heaven and there are nice details everywhere. As cats live on the property, cuddles are expected but bring a roller along :)"

The home has everything you need and it's also creative and inspiring. Would stay there again!"
5870,873383,145183938,2017-04-17,9881270,Nicole,Isabelle took such great care of me when I visited Stockholm. She invited me to a fun afternoon out with her friends so I got to experience Stockholm like a real local. Her apartment was clean and easy to access by public transportation. She's also part of Stockholm's cool start-up scene and has some interesting projects in the works. 
5871,873383,156403363,2017-05-30,39917421,Arnaud,"I stayed during one month at Isabelle's place. She was a fantastic host, very friendly and easy going. She gave me many advices and invited me multiple times to join her and her friends. I was in stockholm to work at karolinska institutet. The place is well located with quick access to metro in a very calm neighborhood. She has two lovely cats. I highly recommend Isabelle's place for your stay."
5872,873383,158127174,2017-06-05,66190193,JongWon,"Her room is very lovely. It makes me comfortable like my home. It is calm and peaceful. Living room(apple tv 4 generation) and kitchen are spacious and available. Your room is also spacious and have lots of storage space. There is multi tab. Her house is full of beautiful plants and pictures. When you wake up or come to home, cute cat will say hello to you. She helped me out quickly when I have questions.
Tip 1. Go to Sigtuna if you are interested in history and runic stones.
Tip 2. When I stayed, there was food festival on garden of king. If you join local festival, it will make your trip more wonderful. "
5873,873383,159196281,2017-06-10,12208589,Su Huat,Isabelle is so friendly and helpful and we enjoyed our stay in her apartment before heading home. The apartment is slightly further from city but it is near to the metro station that make our stay very convenient and comfortable.

5876,873383,185348396,2017-08-21,80479092,Bryan,"The apartment and room are peaceful, but on a great line that takes you to many central places in the city. About 30 minutes to walk and ride that line to old town. The bed was comfortable, and Isabelle was super helpful answering questions. She invited me to the Outdoor Cinema, and I went two nights. A great way to meet the people who actually live in the area. Very comfortable and convenient place to stay and I highly recommend."
5877,873383,187164957,2017-08-26,82322730,Kim,"Jag skrev till Isabelle dagen innan jag skulle komma men fick inget svar, inte via telefon eller airbnb. Under resdagen fick jag heller inge svar trots många försök, tillslut var jag helt enkelt tvungen att åka. När jag väl kommer fram så svarar hon inte, jag lyckas komma in i trapphuset tack vare en granne, det lyser i lägenheten men ingen öppnar eller svarar på något sätt. Jag kom fram i Stockholm kl 19.15. Jag ringde och smsade och tog till alla medel för att få tag i Isabelle men jag fick traska tillbaka till bilen med all packning. Min pappa ringde han också och tog till alla medel för att få tag i Isabelle, jag visste inte vad jag nu skulle göra och jag hade åkt en bra bit och det började bli kväll. Kl 20.04 fick pappa tag i hennes arbetskollega på något vis, de var på kräftskiva/fest och Isabelle hade glömt att jag skulle komma den dagen, hon trodde att jag skulle komma dagen efter. hennes telefon var på lagning. tillslut lyckas isabelle ringa mig via hennes arbetskollega. Det skulle ta 1 timma för henne att komma, hon skulle bara göra en sak för en vän först. jag satt i bilen fortfarande men isabelle erbjöd att grannarna kunde ta mig in sålänge, de kommer säkert bjuda på vodka sa hon, men jag sa nej för ärligt så kände jag mig inte bekväm, jag var trött men hade en god ton, tänkte att 1 timma kunde jag väl stå ut. Det tog 3 timmar. kl 21.50 skrev hon på air bnb att jag kunde börja gå mot henne. Dåligt. På fredagen skulle hon åka på semester och det var min sista natt, då kom en kille som ""soffsurfar"" och sov där. Det gick jag inte med på från början när jag ville sova hos henne. anledningen till att jag inte bytte hem var för att jag helt enkelt inte vågade med mera krångel, jag skulle jobba på mässan och skulle ändå inte vara hemma. Riktigt dåligt. Värst var de 3 timmar som jag fick  vänta i bilen."
5878,873383,200643268,2017-10-06,13931463,Ellie,Isabelle is very nice host! She helped me alot.

I want to highlight that this place has two lovely cats!!! They are soooo adorable. Especially for the huge male farmer's cat ""monster"", he will always gently purring to you and want to get  a bully scratch-pretty rare for a cat :)"

5889,873383,312841754,2018-08-24,207948029,Eline,"I liked staying in Isabelle's colorful and cozy apartment. Although the apartment is not located in the very city of Stockholm, the public transport connections are really excellent. In addition, the quiet area of the apartment is ideal for those wishing to escape the noisy and lively city center while staying close to it. Isabelle was a very helpful host. The two pretty cats are a big plus too :-)"

5893,875505,5153522,2013-06-15,4101627,Iain,"Well located and nicely kept small apartment. Can barely be more central. Was just here for a couple of days for work. 

Make sure you get the code for the door, can be a bit confusing without. 

Although Electra wasn't there when I was in Stockholm her friends were great for dropping off and collecting keys. 

Recommend it. "
5894,875505,6137101,2013-07-31,7476681,Daniel,Nice and clean apartment in the centre of Stockholm. Everything is on walking distance.

Very clean and everything was walking distance.  Electra was a great host and checked up on us to make sure we did not need anything.  If this apt is available on my next visit to Stockholm, will definitely be booking again. Thank you Electra!:)"

5899,875505,14195077,2014-06-14,15600735,Ash,"Electra is super chill,  very personable and has a sweet flat.
Everything you need is here including super fast fibre internet. Which is a god send for me. 

I'm business, so need certain amenities more than a tourist, and hotels have a habit of having super slow web, so it make a nice change to be able to watch some Netflix. Being able to clean my clothes (Washer and Dryer here), cook for myself and have a fridge is also a nice change.

The flat is also mega clean, the bed is nice and comfy (definite must), and she has an airbed, or pull out mattress for extra people.

And if you have any questions, Electra is willing to help out. 

Oh and the location is smack bang in the middle of it all. Been enjoying the short walk home from the local nightlife. And the T-Bana underground line is less than 5 minutes walk away, at which point all of Stockholm is at your fingertips.

And if you should miss the last tram home, well, you're never to far from Electra's flat it seems.

So I can't really say much more positive, I think I've covered it all, Electra and her flat are awesome, and how all on Airbnb should be. And good price too. (Search up the hotels in this area and you'll know what I mean)

:)"
5900,875505,22393468,2014-11-05,15797323,Fabian,"Electra really was a super relaxed host and everything went perfectly smooth. She also was extremely caring and helpful during my 2-month-stay at her appartement. 

The appartement itself really has all you need and the location could not be any better. Not only Stockholm's biggest clubs are within a minute's walk, but also several shops, cinemas, parks, bars, public transport and lots of restaurants. 

It feels like you're living right in Stockhholms heart! :)
I can highly recommend staying with Electra! "
5901,875505,22894728,2014-11-17,4691550,Josh,"Had a great stay at Electra's flat. The space was bright, clean and cozy. The location was fantastic for exploring the city on foot and close to the metro. Would highly recommend this place and Electra was a perfect host."

Electra met me upon my arrival (which was late) and she was extremely nice and accommodating. The apartment is very nice and the pictures are accurate, though she has upgraded the bed to a sleeper/sofa that is very comfortable and converts to a chaise lounge when not a bed. As Electra mentions, it's extremely quiet for it being so centrally located as it's on a smaller side street. 

I highly recommend this apartment and Electra as a host!"
5905,875505,47514587,2015-09-19,42734352,Sylvain,"Electra's appartment was the perfect fit for a couple on a city discovering tour. It was nice, cozy, clean and sober. The location was amazing. In the citycenter and close to everything (shopping, restaurants, metro and train station) but non the less perfectly quiet. 

Electra was a very kind and helping host.

We were very happy to stay there for a week and would highly recommand this place to anyone who wants to discover the beautiful city of Stockholm."

Apartment was located inside a clean building on the 6th floor, elevator access was available which was wonderful with all of our luggage. Lots of great restaurants nearby! Apartment was clean and comfortable, had the essentials. Bathroom was a great size (much improved over some of our other European apartments with tiny bathrooms) Electra met us to check in and was a great host and easily reachable via messaging. We loved our stay."

It's in a great location just a 15 minute walk from the station and the old town and harbours with many shops, restaurants, bars and supermarkets nearby. "

It's also very well located in the heart of Stockholm. The one negative is that the duvet provided for the sofa bed is quite small for two people who are sharing but this could be easily fixed and overall it was a great stay.

Her place is very spacious and covers all your travelling necessities without feeling too convoluted or overly furnished which helps a great deal in making the flat feel like your home in a very short time. It was super clean and has a very spacious bathroom too. Electra herself was very accommodating and carefully explained everything which I really appreciated. Last but not least, the flat is conveniently situated literally in the heart of the city. It truly doesn't get any better than that. Irrespective of if you want to do some shopping, discover good restaurants and cafés, go for a walk at Djurgården, visit the museeums or make a boat trip, you find everything at a stone's throw distance."

5924,875505,276195927,2018-06-13,95040789,Hz,"It is a spacious studio, centrally located and quiet at the same time.

5931,875505,317010804,2018-09-01,179424341,Natalya,"Great experience, prehaps the best appartment i rented through Airbnb, although it's not cheap. Location is ideal, space is more than enough for two people (in great contrast to hotels of the same price), there is a coffee machine and minimum kitchen equipment so that you can do breakfast or quick lunch, there's a washing machine and dishwasher, making the trip even more relaxed, and overall: it's very cosy, yet spacious and simple, just what you would expect in your perfect accomodation.:)  And the owner, Electra, is very welcoming and easy-going."
5932,875505,329553919,2018-09-29,31873511,Barbara,"The flat was very clean, in the kitchen you can find all what you may need. The bed is a sofa bed, but enough wide for a couple.
Very well located and very close to two metro stations.
Freja is very accurate host, she waited for us till late in the evening and she always replies quickly.
Really raccomended!"
5933,875505,352444061,2018-11-25,45054440,Reza,"Freja's place is a really great, centrally located place in Stockholm. It's super central; but on a nice quiet street. Best of both worlds of easy access to everything, but being able to get rest when you need it.

The apt is nice and sunny, while the building is new and in good shape. There are a million great coffee shops nearby, and the subway stops are super close too.

Freja, herself, is very knowledgeable about the city, and a great communicator. In short, I highly recommend this place!"
5934,875505,357920289,2018-12-12,12053525,Anna,Freja is a very nice and well organized host. I really liked the flat which was nice and clean. I would absolutely choose to come back.

5936,875505,451822037,2019-05-12,5206941,Stefano,"Freja’s place is perfect from every point of view. Location is very central and the building is amazingly quiet, but once out on the street everything Stockholm can offer as nightlife, restaurants, clubs and bars is there. The flat is perfect for 2
People,  provided with everything you need, bright light-wise and stylish furniture-wise. Easy communication with Freja and flexible check-in and out."
5937,875505,453593996,2019-05-16,253813183,Paulina,"Freja's place is in an amazing location. I stayed there for a work conference, which was taking place downtown. It was so easy and lovely to walk to the office downtown, and I loved the pedestrian street just one block away full of restaurants and shops. Her place is light and sunny and spacious, and she has charming little bits of decor."
5938,875505,458459296,2019-05-26,249347483,Rossella,"Freja is the perfect host. She is a very nice, kind, lovely person and her welcome fantastic. I felt at home. The flat is located in the best position you can have in Stockholm and you find there everything you need for a very comfortable stay. The description of the flat matches perfectly with reality. I truly recommend this place, you cannot find anything better. Thank you Freja!"

5942,875505,519379446,2019-08-28,7038297,Jeremy,"While the place may seem bare, it is actually serene and and calm. There are no frills or fuss at all. A functional kitchen for nights in (it can get expensive eating out in Stockholm). A spacious bathroom, with a washer/dryer. An amazing view of the sunrise/sunset over the expansive city. The best part though... the prime location, surrounded by shopping centers, green parks for relaxing, metro stop within close distance, and countless of sightseeing areas to explore. If you are flying in from the airport, there's an express train taking you straight to Central Station - a 10 minute walk from the flat!

I'll shut up now. Just know you're getting a good deal with this lovely home."
5943,875505,525833720,2019-09-08,143550936,Garazi,"Very good location, very clean and nice. Freja welcomed us very kindly and recommended several vegan places to eat. The only thing that was a bit awkward for us was that the quilt was a bit small for two people, but we told her about it and I'm sure she will consider it."
5944,875505,532619723,2019-09-20,57982978,Zoran,"Lovely place and host, good location and close to Metro stations. Easy communication with Freja."

There is a bus stop in the front of the apartment which takes within 10 min from Linneholmen, and it was very convenience when we had much stuff or carried a baby car.
We hope to stay there again next time, too.

5946,897584,3909051,2013-03-26,4081447,Severine,"Viveka's home is just a peaceful charming and so Swedish little place. My family and I had a great stay there, everything is lovely and comfortable. Viveka is a great host, she came to get us at the metro station, she had some food prepared for us and she had gatered a lot of information to make our holiday so easy... the place was so clean, and charming, and close to the center but still : in the middle of the forest. Definitely the place to be !!! I will book it again if I go back to Sweden ! tack Viveka !

Although she was traveling at the time of our visit and wasn't around to meet us, she was very helpful via text messaging and email (whenever we had a question she would reply straight away with an answer). Her flat is situated 5 min walk from Ornsberg metro station and about one minute from a bus stop that takes you to Liljeholmen (red line), it took us about 20 minutes to get to Galma Stan. We Will defo come back again to stay at Vivekas - we recommend her place to everyone !"

There are paths behind her apartment that lead to Vinterviken, a stunning little bay with plenty of ducks and boats. We had a very nice and quiet time."
5953,897584,6365704,2013-08-10,5835715,Neus,"Fuimos con dos niños a Estocolmo y el apartamento de Viveka fue perfecto! Es pequeño pero amplio, con todo lo necesario, tanto para dormir como para comer. Además, está exquisitamente decorado, lo que lo hace especialmente acogedor! Tiene una terraza preciosa que da a un pequeño bosque en el que vimos un cervatillo. 
Tiene una parada de bus delante mismo. Para ir en metro, está un poco más lejos, pero lo bueno es que al lado tiene un supermercado que abre hasta las 23h, ideal para comprar la cena y el desayuno del día siguiente. 
Viveka es muy atenta: nos vino a recoger en la parada de metro para enseñarnos cómo llegar en autobús a casa. Nos ofreció incluso comida que tenía en la despensa. 
Un 10. "

It is perfectly located, reaching the city center within 15 minutes and yet very calm and quiet.

Her apartment was very clean and comfortable and she did a lot of effort to arrange everything we needed.

Her home is very close to Stockholm center (approx. 15 min. by metro), quiet countryside. Home is new renovated – all furniture is new!!! Kitchen is fully equipped! Wi-Fi signal is strong. I think that ratio price / quality is excellent! HIGHLY RECOMENDED! Don't hesitate :)))"

We were given towels and coffee and tee, which was a nice gesture. Viveka is the perfect hostess! She met us at the train station and gave us the key, and let us keep our luggage in the apartment until we left for the airport Sunday evening. She also checked in on us by sms during our stay to see if we needed something.
The apartment is a 5 minutes walk from the subway station, and it takes about 8 minutes to Södermalm and 13 minutes to Gamla Stan. So it's not super central, but not far away either. I would have like to stay a little closer to the city center, but we had a great stay, and would absolutely recommend Viveka's apartment. "

Even though we booked at the last minute, he was very responsive, gave us everything we needed, including showing us how to use the laundry downstairs and giving us some good suggestions as to things currently going on in the city.   The apartment is even better than the photos: bright and spacious, decorated with an obviously well developed aesthetic sensibility, and a nice view towards the river.  It is calm and quiet.  It was also perfectly located for our needs, right in the middle of things, but in a quiet area.   Metro is only a couple of blocks away.   The main bed was extremely comfortable, and I tend to be picky.  The couch in the living room is also comfortable when used as a bed.  Kitchen has everything one could need, including an espresso machine and a dishwasher. In short, I could not recommend it more highly. "
5990,897730,98317416,2016-08-30,41197240,Melina,"We had a really good stay in Mats apartment. The location was perfect for us: in the culturally diverse and vibrant district ""Södermalm"", but in a nice and quiet, though still central residential area with good connections to public transport. Also, having the balcony with an amazing view was really nice and we found everything well equipped, clean and ready for us (towels, bedlinen etc.). The apartment has its own charms with an artsy / bohemian ambience and nice wooden floortiles. The bathroom is really small and not new standard, but as it is an old house, we didn't expect otherwise. 
Communicating with Mats was really nice and he was approachable for us before and during ou stay. He couldn't meet us personally, but his friendly son was there when we arrived, showed us around and explained everything to us. 
I would definitely recommend this place and if I come back to Stockholm I would like to stay here again. Thank you, Mats!"
5991,897730,184631331,2017-08-20,7509427,Maximilian,"Mats is a great and helpful guy! The appartement was very clean and is perfect equipped. The Metro is very close, so you can get to every place quick. If you travel by car there are a lot of parking possibilities (Monday - Friday about 80 SEK per day). All in all we had a very good time in Stockholm.

Thanks to Mats"
5992,897730,186299295,2017-08-24,28063729,Josef,"Mats's place is extremely clean and well kept.  The view from the balcony on a clear day is stunning.

The location is very convenient with 5min access to the metro and 2min to the nearest bus stop.

Mats was friendly, helpful and flexible."
5993,897730,190046353,2017-09-03,120201963,Jenna,"This beautiful apartment sits in a quiet and safe neighborhood. Just about 4 blocks walking distance to nearest train station -Hornstull. Hosts Garp and Astrid are very friendly and provided prompt communication. They helped us with navigating through the city and great places to visit. The apartment decor is very unique and ecclectic. There is one sleeping bedroom with double bed, galley kitchen with all appliances, and two sofas -one in living room and another in hallway. The balcony is comfortable and has amazing views. A place you won't regret staying."
5994,897730,192461358,2017-09-10,23678606,Alicia,We had an amazing time in Stockholm. The flat is beautiful and well placed. It's close from the metro station and the city center. The flat has everything you need.

Sehr netter Host.
Sehr stilvolle Wohnung.
Alles perfekt!"
5996,897730,196852426,2017-09-24,29950808,Liz,Garp and Astrid's home is one of my favourite Airbnb's I've stayed. The location is excellent and the apartment itself is beautifully decorated with lots of space. Garp was very helpful and accommodating  of our travel plans. Both he and Astrid have wonderful tips of what to see and do in the area. I would highly recommend staying here!
5997,897730,198132348,2017-09-28,96906770,Nina,"We had a great time at Garp's. It exceeded our expectation. The location was excellent, very close to bus stops and the subway. 
The apartment was spotless. Would definitely stay here again. Really comfy bed, a great space for 2 people."
5998,897730,199193558,2017-10-01,29773649,Svetla,"The apartment is very well situated, near the metro station, so we could get easily to all the places that we wanted to visit. The neighbourhood is calm. The apartment is nice, clean, bright and having all the necessary equipment. There was coffee, tea, bread for the breakfast and shampoo, towels etc. in the bathroom). Garp is very kind and he had a good communication with him; he gave us a map and some tips for restaurants, sightseeing, etc. We can strongly recommend his place. Thanks a lot, Garp!"

Der er en fantastisk udsigt over fjorden og byen fra altan og køkken. Gennemført og velholdt bygning, nem og hurtig kontakt. En virkelig god base for et Stockholmbesøg."
6002,900043,49841999,2015-10-06,27854744,Robert,"This is a lovely flat and exactly as described and photographed by the host. The flat was tidy, clean, practical and felt very homely. We didn't meet the host personally, but the handing over of keys worked perfectly and all communiction before and throughout the stay was friendly and very quick. "
6003,900043,51351425,2015-10-19,5331365,Ali,I did the booking on behalf of my parents. They arrived to the place with no problem. Their experience was good.
6004,900043,52189756,2015-10-26,20250804,Fredrik,Allt funkade smidigt och lätt och mottagningen var städad och madrassen på golvet var bekväm
6005,900043,53545168,2015-11-09,13869743,Claudia,"We never met Annelie but she left us the key under the mat and left us very clear instructions on how to find the building and get into the apartment. The main room was as described although there was not a sitting table by the kitchen as it appears to be in the picture. Everything is pretty much in the same room, beds and the sitting table. The apartment was perfect though for us two, and the location was  excellent! Close to supermarkets, bars and a 2 minute walk from the subway station. I would definitely recommend!"
6006,900043,54765800,2015-11-23,12800686,Martin,"I never met Anneli but she provided easy instructions for getting to the apartment, where to pick up the key etc. It was all very quick and easy, no complaints at all. 

The apartment looks just like in the pics. Small, older place with a warm and cosy feel to it. Perfect for a couple or two friends. It was clean and the amenities did their job. The bathroom was fresh. 

The area is kind of semi urban. Not very happening but you'll find a few bars, stores and so on. Quite calm. The very nearby subway station and bus stop makes travel and commute a breeze, it only takes a few minutes by subway to get to livelier areas, the central station and so on."
6007,900043,56131870,2015-12-09,7031172,Sari,Perfect location close to everything! The flat is very clean and nice.

6009,900043,62736719,2016-02-16,44843237,Alexia,"Our stay at Annelie's flat was great - the directions were spot on and the location was superb!! Right next to the water, near bars/supermarkets/tube lines - all super. The flat was exactly as described which is always nice. One warning is that if you open the kitchen/dining table - be very careful to pull out the corner 'leg' as our plates fell off the table and smashed on the floor :( Annelie was very kind and accepted our plate replacements. Overall it was a perfect place for a weekend in Stockholm - highly recommend !"
6010,900043,64115708,2016-02-29,57433505,Miranda,Great apartment close to the underground.  Annelie gave clear directions and was quick to respond to questions via text or email.  Towels were provided
6011,900043,65591496,2016-03-15,15122936,Alison,Annelie's apartment was a great base from which to explore Stockholm. The location of the apartment is really good - just next to the metro and a couple of nice bars.  Her communication was great and it was all very easy. Thank you!
6012,900043,66415007,2016-03-22,25789972,Betty,"Annelie was very nice and helpful. The apartment was the same as what it's described. The location is perfect, just 5 mins away from the stations of MTR and airport coach, shopping mall,super market, restaurant etc. We really enjoyed our stay :) Highly recommend."
6013,900043,67338755,2016-03-28,64218030,Fabien,"We really enjoyed our stay in Annelie's flat. The location is very good, close to the metro which brings you everywhere in a short period of time. Good communication, fair listing, I recommend."
6014,900043,69485960,2016-04-11,56160115,Yanming,"Not meet the landlord in person, but she is easily reached by phone. The place is accurately described by the pic, and it is more spacious that I expect. Generally it is suitable for 1-2 person."
6015,900043,70379930,2016-04-17,32775392,Daniel,"I had a great time there. The flat was clean and very close to the metro, Hornstull. She was very kind too. I strongly reccommend this opportunity for everyone."
6016,900043,72443224,2016-05-02,7548640,George,"The apartment is cozy, clean and as pictured, the location is great, near the metro station and with restaurants, cafes, shops all around. Annelie answered any question we had and made us feel welcome."
6017,900043,73390074,2016-05-08,7020655,Nassima,Overall good experience. Good location very close to the metro station and to a pub. Cosy flat small but enough for 2 friend like us. Points for improvement; needs Internet connexion and a TV
6018,900043,74230163,2016-05-14,49912379,Janne,"Lejligheden er præcis som på billederne. Der var rent og hyggeligt, og der var lagt sengetøj og håndklæder frem. Ligeledes var der en fin guide til at finde skraldespande og vaskemuligheder i kælderen.
Køkkenet er lille, men der er alt hvad man skal bruge.
Udlevering og aflevering af nøgle foregik nemt og bekvemt.
Selve beliggenheden var helt perfekt. Lige ved siden af en T-bana-station med shoppingcenter og supermarked og stoppested for bussen til lufthavnen. Jeg vil helt klart anbefale denne lejlighed til andre :)"
6019,900043,74954053,2016-05-17,37211526,Christina,"We didn't get to meet Annelie. Nevertheless, the apartment was welcoming and just as described. It is a very good location, since the apartment is right by a shopping mall, tram station, and stop for the airport bus. Very convenient! 
We really enjoyed our stay. Thank you!"
6020,900043,76094232,2016-05-24,37426585,Pierandrea,"We never met Annalie, the only think she told us to so was to leave the flat till 9 a.m. as we did. When I arrived I found the flat durty in particular the bathroom and the wc (but alao the rest of the flat was full of dust and woman hairs). We were 3 people and we had 2 blankets to sleep. There were a few pens, so you cannot cook anything at home and you are obliged to go out for dinner (and the city is super expensive). The flat is close to the center and we visited everything wolking (we never catched the metro)."
6021,900043,77410740,2016-05-31,18601,Richard,"Great little apartment in Hornstull, Close to lots of good restaurants and the T-bana. Annelie was helpful and very friendly.  Her apartment has a great feel, open for being small.  I would recommend this place.  "
6022,900043,79881357,2016-06-14,5050778,Alina,"It was very easy to communicate with Annelie before and during my stay. The flat was clean and exactly as described.  It is a 1-2 minute walk from a Tunnelbana station, which was very convenient.  The neighborhood is safe and only a couple stops away from the heart of Södermalm. There are also plenty of bars and restaurants within a short walk.  

I did not cook, so I cannot comment on the kitchen.  

For guests visiting during the summer, you may want to bring an eye mask since the curtains are sheer and there is light through the window at all times.  Also, take special note the listing does not have wifi.   

I would stay here again! "
6023,900043,81346305,2016-06-22,66153910,Dave,Great place to stay at in Stockholm. On the smaller side but perfect for a solo traveler. Great neighborhood and easy to get around anywhere in Stockholm. Highly recommended!
6024,900043,98306966,2016-08-30,15656211,Reuben,"Annelie's flat is very cool. Great location and nice space. The only drawbacks are the lack of wifi and the noise from the street, but it's definitely worth the price, and the noise from the street is probably unavoidable in such a central location."
6025,900043,99446997,2016-09-04,65931243,Lewis,"Great location, superb little flat if you are on a budget! Really enjoyed our stay, the host was very kind and responsive and collecting the key was very easy. "

I felt like home :) Annelie was very helpfull, I had no problem in getting to the apartament and she was always anwsering my questions very fast. 
Thank you very much for letting me be your guest! 
Best place to stay in Stockholm!"
6030,900043,111388884,2016-10-31,54474868,Folkert,"The room was in a nice neighbourhood. We walked a couple of times to the centre of Stockholm, but if you don't want to, you could easily take the subway that was just 1 minute away. The room is okay if you don't want to spend too much time in the room. It had a little kitchen, a nice bathroom with shower, but unfortunately no bed (only a mattress on the floor) or wifi. But we especially liked the location. Quiet, but within a small distance of for example SoFo or the centre. "
6031,900043,114021027,2016-11-15,2360454,Daniel,Everything great! Enjoyed it immensely!
6032,900043,117287022,2016-12-06,86682869,Celine,"Le rapport qualité-prix est bon, la situation de l’appartement est très pratique (très proche de la station de métro Hornstull, petits restaurants autour la place)/ Nous n'avons pas rencontré Annelie. Mais elle nous a laissé des cartes de Stockholm et des dépliants sur les endroits à voir. Quelques inconvénients : matelas sur le sol, vieux appareils de cuisine et pas d’ouverture de fenêtre possible. "

Pour les sexagénaires le lit est un matelas posé par terre donc bas !appartement bien chauffé et 2 fauteuils confortables pas de wifi  bon rapport qualité prix pour stockholm. 
6035,900043,123196689,2016-12-28,47729793,Miguel,"Apesar de nunca termos conhecido  a dona da casa pessoalmente, correu tudo bem com o check in/out . 
O apartamento está bem localizado , a 5  minutos ha o metro e autocarros que te levam a qualquer lugar da cidade.
Não haver televisão tudo bem mas hoje em dia penso que ter internet disponível ė essencial .
Na nossa opinião o apartamento ė bom para uma pessoa que viage sozinha , pois para um casal aquele colchão de 1.20 m ė terrível, as mantas e os lençóis que nos foram dados eram de cama de solteiro e os meus estavam um bocado rasgados .
Além de apertados aquecíamos demasiado pois duas mantas de aquecimento num espaço pequeno escusado será dizer que aqueçe bem.
Não, não  dava para usar só uma manta porque eram demasiado pequenas para duas pessoas.
Sendo inverno tivemos algumas questões com a janela da sala que tem uma pequena abertura que faz corrente de ar , tivemos de mudar o colchão de sítio ,a temperatura do apartamento não dava para regular bem pois tem um sistema bastante velho só permite ajustar os aquecedores.
Ha algum ruído vindo da rua , não nos incomodou muito , para quem está habituado a dormir com tudo escuro terá alguns problemas pois não há uma cortina que escureça um bocado.
Eu pessoalmente dormi muito mal a minha namorada um bocado melhor, é pena pois com um bocado de melhorias seria um apartamento óptimo mesmo para casais."
6036,900043,125319529,2017-01-05,36506405,Carolina,"The apartment is placed near very dynamic streets, close to supermarkets and many means of transportation. Definetly a great place for young couples and friends who want to be in the centre of Stockholm most charming area"
6037,900043,127948785,2017-01-22,18085376,Eszter,"Nice and cosy place with an interesting ezoteric aura, good location to the underground. Unfortunalety the discription does not say that there is no wifi or internet, only crossed off from the extras, was not evident for me... But we had a really good time there, the bed is really comfortable, all is fine for a romantic weekend.
"
6038,900043,130209747,2017-02-05,52916983,Ingrid,"Good basic place, cheap and good location both for public transport and for walking. Would be good if it was stated more clearly that there's no wifi. We missed being able to open the window, but would definitely recommend this place. "
6039,900043,136716283,2017-03-12,47879242,Gulfer,The house was very pretty. Especially the location is excellent. Great for both the city center and the airport. Christian planned everything and responded quickly to all my messages. I highly recommend to all guests.
6040,900043,141715324,2017-04-04,17596969,Andreas,"Christins Appartment liegt am quirligen Hornstull mit netten Cafés, Läden und Supermärkten. Es ist durch die Tunnelbahn sehr gut angebunden. Das Appartment selbst ist einfach aber funktional eingerichtet - die alten Möbel versprühen den Charme vergangener Zeiten. Obwohl das Appartment an einer stark befahrenen Straße liegt, ist es erstaunlich ruhig (solange man die Fenster geschlossen hält). Der Check-In war  absolut problemlos und Christin hat alle unsere Fragen rasch beantwortet. Alles in allem haben wir ein paar wirklich schöne Tage in Stockholm verbracht."
6041,900043,144967538,2017-04-17,42681754,Attilio,"Veldig bra forholdet, nær ved sjøen og kollektiv. Christin var tilgjengelig og hjalp oss med tingene vi trengte. Vi anbefaler stedet!"

The location is perfect: super nice neighbourhood full of restaurants and bars and close to the metro which takes you everywhere. I had the best time, thanks again!! "

6045,900043,158315274,2017-06-06,22254796,Katrin,"Kleines Appartment an einer Hauptverkehrsstraße gelegen, die Betten bestehen aus Matratzen, Kommunikation mit der Gastgeberin war unkompliziert und freundlich. Die Fotos gegen genau wieder, wie es im Appartment aussieht, leider hat die Küche und das Badezimmer kein Fenster oder Lüftungsmöglichkeit und die Sauberkeit lies zu wünschen übrig. Die Anbindung an die Stadt ist per U-Bahn sehr gut, zu Fuß dauert es ca. 20 Minuten."
6046,900043,159501713,2017-06-11,4187633,Ali,"We stayed over a long weekend and the experience was great. The communication went very smooth and everything was set perfectly. Great location, close to a splendid neighborhood and easy to reach with the metro. "
6047,900043,169999712,2017-07-14,89485922,Maor,"We had a lovely stay, everything needed seems to be in perfect order:
- The location is great - just cross the street to the Metro. 10min to Central Station.
- The 2 beds were comfortable for 2 persons - (The 2nd bed, the sofa bed, we didn't use. Rather, we put mattress on the floor, and the Sofa bed mattress on top of it. It was very comfortable, and you don't have to worry about it) 
- The shower worked great, and we had a fully equipped kitchen and bathroom.
- The response time was quick and efficient.
- Everything was clean.

One thing to note:
- No Wifi (it's in the description, no complains), though you can get around with wifi around the coffee shops and such. It's also possible (We learned at the end of the trip), to get a Sim Card and charge it, it's supposed to be really cheap."
6048,900043,175151871,2017-07-28,16461474,Sofia,"The house was pleasant and corresponded to the uploaded pictures and description. It is in a very calm and tranquil neighborhood, next to a nice island where you can walk or swim, slightly out of the city center, but practically in front of the Hornstull subway station, from where you can reach the center in 20 minutes. A longer way of getting there is by walking for a good 40/50 min on the beautiful walk on the sea. In any case, the house is a good solution for a good price, but the fact that the kitchen is small and not fully equipped – perhaps just for us needy Italians! – and that it is, after all, a very simple accommodation make this house a more suited place for a short visit – 2/3 days – rather than for a long one – a week, like we did."
6049,900043,182285145,2017-08-14,28662523,Jean Francois,"L'appart a l'inconvénient de ses avantages: situé proche de nombreux points d'intérêts, il est plutôt bruyant"

Evitez les longs sejours, vous en aurez marre."
6051,900043,258973479,2018-04-30,107154625,Brittany,"What an amazing place. Small, but very cozy. Decorated nicely. Had tea and a kettle so we enjoyed nice cuppas in the mornings. Christin was a lovely host and communicated with us so well. We loved the location of this place. It was a 3 minute walk to the subway station which led us to everywhere in Stockholm we wanted to go to. Gamla Stan was a total gem. Absolutely loved it there!! Christin recommended eating at Ramblas Tapas, which was a very short walk from her Air B&B. What an AMAZING restaurant. We loved Sweden, and for our first time visiting, it couldn’t have been any more perfect. Special thanks to Christin with her lovely flat! "
6052,900043,440737965,2019-04-21,7038748,Shiri,"Perfect location for exploring Stockholm, with most areas walkable from the apartment. Christin was a great host and made everything easy for us. The apartment was nice and comfortable."

6055,900043,467418048,2019-06-10,45427918,Rob,"Christin is very responsive and welcoming. Instructions for check-in and check-out were clear and flexible (late arrival was no problem at all). 
The apartment itself has everything we needed; different places to sit and have a drink (coffee/tea/refrigerated drinks were available), a French balcony also for fresh air, superb location close to the metro, nice bars, the park. The bathroom is not large, but the strong shower was great.
We felt welcome and would certainly recommend."

Check in and check out went very smoothly. Would definitely stay here again when back in Stockholm. Thank you Christin."
6057,903577,74421675,2016-05-15,20124341,Viktor,"Now, I am not sure whether Jeanette will rent out her room again in the future - and probably not at Eurovision rates :) - but I will still take the chance to be the first one ever to leave a review!     

It was a wonderful stay without any problems - Jeanette is a really nice person, friendly and helpful; and her home is a cosy place.
We both happened to be involved into the Eurovision Festival that week, and have had some very nice conversations together.     

The room is part of an apartment on the ground-floor of a big house, in a residential community. It has got everything it needs: a very comfortable bed, enough light, a big commode to store our  things. The apartment itself is big, neat and well-equipped - a proper family home.     

The location, even though slightly off the centre, is actually ideal - it is just next to a city-train station, on the central line. So, it takes 20 min door-to-door to get from the house to the city-centre. And it is a lovely, calm area, with a park and a supermarket.
If you attend any event/concert in one of the Globe Arenas - they are walking distance (15 min) from the house. Then, no better position than this one.     

I say - Tack, Jeanette!  for making my stay at this festival an enjoyable one!  Will get in touch if I come around Stockholm again!

He left towels and sheets for me and my guest, and even told me to help myself to his kitchen! While I did not get a chance to meet Menaf in person, he was communicative throughout the stay and was always available to answer any questions.  The apartment itself was in a great location-- close to the metro and airport shuttle stop and in a hip little neighborhood. I would highly recommend his place for anyone visiting stockholm!"
6065,904739,14368776,2014-06-17,3855961,Philipp,"Menaf is the nicest host ever. He welcomed us in a cool apartment designed in fancy 1970's style with everything a traveler needs: food in the fridge, romantic bed, nice window-view and large TV-room full with gadgets (if you need some). We found ourselves in the hip part of hip Sodermalm with an island-park, riverside bars and a beach five minutes' walk from the door. Highly recommended! "
6066,904739,15118366,2014-07-02,9999268,Kyla,Manaf was a fantastic host. He responded graciously to all of my questions before and after arrival. He went above and beyond leaving wine and other kitchen goods for our use (never fun to have to buy things like olive oil and S&P for a short stay). The apartment was as bright and lovely as it looks in the pictures (and the couch was very comfy). Thanks Menaf!
6067,904739,17859041,2014-08-18,18334608,Joe,Menaf met me when I arrived and was extremely helpful. His apartment was larger than expected for a studio and was extremely clean. It's located in a perfect area just minutes from local coffee shops and the T. His street is very quiet but minutes from the center of the nightlife.I wanted to stay longer but he was returning from a vacation. LOVED this place. Highly recommend staying here.
6068,904739,18756817,2014-08-31,5343519,Nicholas,Menaf was an extraordinary host going out of his way to make us feel at home.  The apartment's couch and bed are both very comfortable and the location is really well situated.

6070,904739,21256688,2014-10-13,4607270,Lucia,"Menaf's place is amazing! The apartment is comfortable and cozy and the location is grate.
Besides Menaf leave as some food on the refrigerator, which was grate because we arrive very late at night and everything was closed.
We had a wonderful weekend in Stockholm, thanks Menaf!"
6071,904739,23183808,2014-11-24,23655812,Orlando,"The apartment is great and Menaf took care of everything so we can enjoy our stay. The apartment was clean and full equipped. It has big windows which make the apartment very bright even in cloudy days :)

As we stay in November when days starting to be chilly, the heaters and isolation works perfectly to keep us warm after our long walks through Stockholm.

I fully recommend stay at Menaf apartment when you visit Stockholm.

"
6072,904739,23508295,2014-12-02,3257811,Hendel,"Great Communication! Menaf was very kind during my stay and helped us to do an smooth check in.

I did not meet Menaf, but he was very easy to communicate with and had one of his friends meet me at the flat.  Menaf was very accommodating and made sure I had everything I needed.  Definitely recommend this place!"
6074,904739,25833695,2015-01-26,22067091,Zac,"Such an awesome apartment!  Even better than described, very spacious with absolutely everything you need to have a comfortable stay.  Menaf was a pleasure to deal with, easy to contact / stay in touch with, and super friendly.  

The neighborhood is super cool, great bars, cafes, and the subway all within a 10 minute walk.  

I would recommend this apartment to anyone looking for a rad place to stay while in Stockholm and would stay here again in a heart beat!!

Thank you Menaf!

6075,904739,25946155,2015-01-30,19042138,Arve,"While the apartment is by no means luxurious, although quite spacious, Menaf was an extremely prompt and accommodating host. The location is pretty much perfect, situated in Stockholm's lively Södermalm district."
6076,904739,26068283,2015-02-02,4526174,Stan,"Menaf's home was beautiful, well-kept, spacious, cozy, well-stocked, and very conveniently located. My travel partner and I were thrilled from the moment we walked in the door, and coming back home each day was a pleasure knowing we were returning to such a wonderful spot.

The apartment was better than imagined, more than was advertised. Cozy furniture, all the appliances necessary for basic cuisining, fast WiFi, a coffeeshop next door, spare towels and sheets; honestly all of our needs were anticipated and met.

Speaking of which, Menaf was an indescribably warm and thoughtful host. Fresh fruit in the fridge for us, very clear instructions of how to get to and in the apartment, checkins to make sure everything was going smoothly. If I ever become an AirBnB host, Menaf will be my role model!"
6077,904739,26268742,2015-02-08,2912002,Jose Luis,"La casa es tal como se ve en la foto, muy acogedora y con todos los detalles. No falta de nada. La calefaccion y el agua caliente van perfectamente... Se estaba tan agusto alli que no queria salir a la calle, mientras nevaba.
Hay un autobus desde El aeropuerto de Arlanda que te deja a 5 minutos andando de la casa, tambien el metro, supermercados, tiendas, restaurantes, bares...
Estocolmo es una ciudad fantastica y cuando vuelva, espero poder volver a alojarme en la casa de Menaf, no lo conocí personalmente, pero estuvo pendiente siempre de ayudarme con todo, a traves del (Hidden by Airbnb) . 
100x100 recomendable."

6080,904739,29232663,2015-04-05,15847152,Daniel,"We didn't get to meet Menaf in person, though we wish we had. From start to finish he was helpful and generous and made sure our stay was as delightful as possible. We found the apartment to be very cozy and easy to get to. It is located in a really nice part of the city, with a great Mexican restaurant down the street, a lovely café not far from that and a short walk to the nearest metro station. 

One concern we had, travelling with a small child, was about accessibility - but it wasn't a problem, since the apartment building has an elevator. The apartment is also quite child-friendly and safe."
6081,904739,30235722,2015-04-19,11495484,Mike,"The stay was great! Menaf was incredibly accommodating, answered all of my questions, and was a great host. Thanks again Menaf!"

For Stockholm, this is definitely the best price/quality deal you will find. "
6083,904739,35611206,2015-06-20,8607384,Bengt,Menafs apartment is bright and spacy and I could not ask for better hospitality. Everything was fine. And a good price!
6084,904739,37325362,2015-07-06,22132463,Inga,"Menaf was a very friendly and very helpful host. His apartment is perfectly located in Södermalm - a very hip part of the city. The apartement is fully equipped, bright and clean. Métro and a lot of nice restaurants and cafés are nearby. You can park right in front of the door. We had a super nice stay - totally recommendable. "
6085,904739,39195237,2015-07-21,25086647,Yidan,"Menaf is a really nice host to me! He's in London when I arrived Stockholm, although I've not read the house manual carefully so I met some troubles, Menaf still very patient to tell me about the house. The house is cozy and tidy, really proper for tourists which are 1 or 2 persons. Briefly, I strongly recommend Menaf's house."
6086,904739,40507367,2015-07-31,30858880,Mayra,My stay at Menaf's place was very enjoyable. The studio was clean and the location was perfect. Menaf was very helpful and responsive during my stay. His directions from the airport where very detailed which made finding the unit without gps possible and easy for me. I landed in Stockholm early Monday morning and he was kind enough to let me check in early at no cost.  I would highly recommend his place to anyone visiting Stockholm. 
6087,904739,43040615,2015-08-17,4234440,Robert,"Mean's place is situated in a great neighborhood near shops, bars and restaurants. It's just a short bicycle ride to the city center (Gamla Stan/ Radhuset, etc). The street is very quiet.
The apartment itself was really clean and comfortable, especially for one person (because of the small bed)...But like Menaf says, the couch is also very comfortable. 
Contact with Menaf was quite easy. Before I entered the building, I knew everything I had to know for my stay.
An early check in was no problem, which was excellent!
Stockholm is a very beautiful city and I hope to come back soon and be able to stay at Menaf's place again! I can recommend it."
6088,904739,44729842,2015-08-28,41890410,Mien,"Menaf's place is located in a nice neighbourhood in western Södermalm and offers anything you need! We discovered some very nice bars just 2 blocks away. Besides, our last-minute request was responded immediately. Briefly, a perfect host!"

L'appartement est très bien situé, à à peine 5 minutes à pied du métro, le logement très bien aménagé et cosy, bref, rien à redire, c'était super !"
6091,904739,45864739,2015-09-06,32268033,Erica,We just got back from a weekend in Stockolm.  Menaf's place is a great homebase that is close to everything.  Even getting though we landed at midnight we were still able to find the place without a problem thanks to Menaf's great directions.   The location is right in Soldermalm only about a 2-3min walk from the train station and about a 1-2 min walk from the nearest cycle station.    We would really recommend getting the 3 day pass for the city bikes and riding around the city.  Can't wait until we get back to Stockholm soon...definitely will try to stay at Menaf's again.
6092,904739,47657832,2015-09-21,38011677,Georg,"Hei.  I really enjoyed my stay at Menafs apartment. Everything was as Menafs described. It's starts with which bus I should take from the airport to the apartment, the way to the apartment until where the keys were.  The house/neighborhood is very quiet (haven't heard anyone).  Near the apartment is a nice area to take a walk along the river.  The public transport (metro) is just 5-10 min away and takes ca 10-15 min to Gamla Stan (old city). There are good restaurants and bars just a few min from the apartment.  Menaf is a really good host. The apartment has everything you need for a stay.  The bed and the sofa is really comfortable.  Everything was clean.  Thanks for this Menaf   Anytime again"

It is a stylish, airy, comfortable space and Menaf made everything so easy for us with clear instructions (for example about using local transport), quick responses to any questions, and equipping the flat with everything we needed (such as drinks, shampoo, etc).

Check in was very easy and Menaf left very thorough instructions. The bed was comfortable and the area of town very quiet and on the water. Very close to running trails around Södermalm. Overall very close to everything we wanted to see by way of the metro close by. Couldn’t have asked for more from an Airbnb! Many thanks

And it's located very near a beautiful lake. Only 8 minutes walk to the subway station, and 20 minutes to Stockholm. Highly recommanded. "
6132,916806,4616550,2013-05-15,6089299,Simon,"Mansour and Julia offered us a perfect place to live during our visit to Stockholm. The appartement was clean and comfortable. Mansour and Julia were friendly, helpful and uncomplicated hosts. Thank you very much!"
6133,916806,4730653,2013-05-22,5862936,Elisabeth,"We had a great stay in Stockholm! Mansour was a great host and a really nice person. The apartment was very clean and matched our expectations however, we were a little bit disappointed to see that the panoramic view promised wasn't here. We thought we'll see the forest and river right through our window but thanks the weather that wasn't so bad we could enjoy it by walking outside on a few meters. "
6134,916806,4814511,2013-05-27,6248836,Anna,"The spacious, clean, bright and very well equipped appartment where we enjoyed our Stockhom getaway weekend! If you are looking for some solitude, romance and privacy - that is definitely the right place to stay! The surrounding nature, the proximity to the beautiful park and the spectacular view made our stay unforgettable. Travelling to the city centre is easy as long as you are prepared to spend half on hour for this. We haven't met Mansour, but Julia appeared to be a nice young lady, very welcoming and flexible in terms of check-in/check-out. The hosts stay in the same house on top floor which makes it easy to communicate if necessary.
Highly recommend this appartment to young couples who love to travel but want to feel like home in Stockholm.
Thank you, Julia and Mansour! "
6135,916806,5080784,2013-06-11,5597268,(Email hidden by Airbnb),"Herr Mansour ist ein sehr sympathischer und freundlicher Gastgeber, der uns alle Freiheiten gelassen hat.
Das Appartment war schön und modern eingerichtet mit einem wunderschönen Blick auf den naheliegenden See. Das Appartment  hätte nur ein bischen besser geputzt sein können bei unserer Anreise. Ansonsten war es ein sehr schöner Aufenthalt. "
6136,916806,5116439,2013-06-13,5327958,Mikhail,"We was very glad to stay at Mansour and Julia's place in Stockholm.    The appartement was clean, modern and comfortable. Mansour is very friendly host. The appartement is situated in a very quiet and beautifull place close to national park.  It's not a problem to go to the centre of the city by car (15 km).  Thank you very much!"
6137,916806,5161344,2013-06-16,1878867,Jens,"Mansour offers an apartment in a quiet suburb of Stockholm. It is on the level of a usual airbnb accommodation - nothing more nor less. Worth the price for Stockholm. Positive: Very modern and lately renovated; Mansour replies fast and is very helpful. Negative: Kitchen could be equipped better (e.g. cutting board, corkscrew); Image with panoramic view is misleading (you won´t see this from the apartment and only little of the lake from your terrace). However, I recommend the place to people not having very high requirements concerning cleanliness and cooking."
6138,916806,5229570,2013-06-19,2906816,Nira,"The flat is very good, very clean, everything is brand new. Mansour was fantastic as a host, collected us and took us back to metro station on arrival and departure with his car, because of our luggage.
The only problem is the distance, the flat is very far from the center, and 10 minutes walk from the metro station, which is not clear in airbnb page. "
6139,916806,5447709,2013-07-01,3880659,Vera,"We had a great time at Mansour's and Julia's place. Everything was as described. The couple was really friendly, all the time available and gave us useful recommendations for restaurants and places to shop. The apartment was clean, modern, well-equipped and really nice. Thanks a lot again :-)"
6140,916806,5841563,2013-07-19,5680786,Julie,"We had a great stay at Mansour and Julia's  cosy apartment in Stockholm. They were incredibly generous  and kind hosts who were helpful in so many ways regarding anything that we needed in the apartment and by giving us tips and information about sightseeing in and around Stockholm.The apartment was clean, spacious and new with a modern well equipped kitchen, eating bench with four stools and a comfortable living space separate to the sleeping area. It is in a rustic area on the edge of a national park so at night we got glimpses of local wildlife such as hares and deer. It is fully self contained so we has our own sunny deck to eat outdoors and enjoy the sunshine and views. It is easy to get to public transport with a bus that runs to the station or a pleasant walk thru the park and there is plenty of parking if you have a car.    I would highly recommend their accommodation and we would stay there again. Thank you for making our holiday in Stockholm such a happy experience."
6141,916806,6004915,2013-07-26,6748823,Astrid,"We had a wonderful stay at Mansour's Apartment. We liked the Location because it was very calm and we had the possibility to have the meals outside on the terrace, that was great. We thought the little ""manual"" how to handle everything (recycling, how to find the bus stop, etc.) very helpful. 
If you are looking for more than ""just"" a City trip, we can recommend this place very much."
6142,916806,6170711,2013-08-02,3701510,Stephan,"The apartment of Mansour is very modern and clean with good beds. It is a good place to stay when you want to explore Stockholm while nature is at your doorstep. We've even seen deers in the backyard! It was easy to communicate with Mansour even though he was on holiday. For immediate questions we could contact a close friend or their very friendly neighbour.

The panoramic view is there but only at the other side of the house where Mansour lives. We really had to get used to the fact the sewer couldn't handle toilet paper.

Please keep in mind that if you use the sheets (and towels) you have to pay for them as the bed is already made when you arrive.

We really would recommend this place!"
6143,916806,6362304,2013-08-10,5463343,Marcel,"Very nice apartment with a really big terrace. Everything was clean and comfortable. The kitchen has everything you need to prepare a breakfast and dinner. The apartment is about 10min far from the metro station (by foot), where you can also find a lot of supermarkets. from the metro station is takes about 20min to the city center of Stockholm. I would recommend the apartment to other guest. It is very quiet with a lot of nature nearby and it isn't quite far to the city center."
6144,916806,6506814,2013-08-15,1616780,Clarisse,Nous avons passé un agréable séjour à Stockholm dans le magnifique appartement de Mansour. Les hôtes sont adorables et prévenants. Il faut compter environ 20 mn pour rejoindre le centre-ville mais le quartier est agréable.
6145,916806,6661711,2013-08-20,3098599,Galina,"Замечательная квартира с очень гостеприимными хозяевами. Описание полностью соответствует действительности. Чистая, уютная, со всем необходимым для жилья. удобная парковка для арендованной машины. А какие окрестности! Релакс после московской суеты :) 
Дорогие Юлия и Мансур! Отдельное огромное Вам спасибо за Вашу помощь. Ваша поддержка в ситуации, когда у меня украли паспорт за 12 часов до нашего вылета из Стокгольма, была для нас неоценима. 
Very clean and modern apartment with everything you need. We liked cozy terrace. About 20 minutes to the city centre by rented car. Mansour and Julia were very hospitable and helpful with us. Dear Mansour and Julia! Thank you very much for your help! "
6146,916806,6960988,2013-09-01,7231133,Serena,"Very nice apartment in a residential area, 10 minutes from Skharolmen underground. The house is clean and comfortable and Mansour & Julia were very kind and helpful with us.
I recommend this apartment!"
6147,916806,7159121,2013-09-09,7232898,Svetlana,"We were happy to stay at Mansour apartment per 2 nights. All was great - very clean, comfortable, great view. It takes you 10 minutes to get to subway station and about 20 minutes to get to city center. You can enjoy the beautiful nature around the apartment.

We recommend Mansours apartment to everyone, it is realy comfortable!)"
6148,916806,7862412,2013-10-06,8544792,Alan,"Fantastic stay, great and beautiful location! Mansour and Julia is a wonderful hosts. Everything was perfectly organized!"
6149,916806,9783992,2014-01-10,4038525,Nadezda,"Это были волшебные новогодние каникулы в Швеции! Мансур и Юлия очень дружелюбные, внимательные и отзывчивые хозяева. С ними легко, просто и приятно общаться. Апартаменты полностью совпадают с описанием и фото. 
Уютно, просторно, функционально, комфортно.
Думаю, что летом, когда есть возможность использовать прилегающую террасу, здесь должно быть просто сказочно!

Эти апартаменты понравятся тем, кто хотел бы жить недалеко от центра города, но в то же время и поближе к природе - в тишине, наслаждаться пейзажем и свежим воздухом. 

До метро 10 минут пешком. 20 минут до центра Стокгольма. 
Рядом с метро есть супермаркет, аптека...

Хозяева с заботой о гостях составили брошюру, в которой Вы найдете ответы на возможные вопросы: как добраться до метро, как пользоваться бытовой техникой, как работает входной замок и пр..

Все для Вашего удобства!

Отличный выбор! Искренне рекомендую!

6150,916806,11488012,2014-04-05,12032150,Doris,"I stayed here on my own for 3 weeks and it was perfect. Everything worked, was clean and comfortable. The flat was always warm too and I loved the under floor heating in the kitchen part and the bathromm
The view is outstanding and it is a quick walk to the underground station and shopping facilities.
Would highly recommend"
6151,916806,11805343,2014-04-15,1469930,Pieterjan,Mansour was a great host. They live above the flat which was handy to get and return the key. The flat was very nice and had a terrace overlooking the water and nature. It was close to the metrostation and several shops.
6152,916806,12023787,2014-04-21,8647427,Nila,"Hello, it was nice."
6153,916806,12750990,2014-05-10,11782079,Jennifer,The tima at Julia and Mansour's was very nice. Their apartment is newly renovated and is neslted in a town right next to a lake and a park with lots of nice walking paths. The terasse is large with a nice view; lots of green. All of my questions were answered promptly. There is a very helpful book for guests that the hosts lovingly put to together. I would recommend the apartment and Julia & Mansour as hosts.
6154,916806,12920008,2014-05-14,6238991,Ruslan,"Everything was perfect ! Nice place for quite, relaxing rest. Thank You, Mansour, so much !"
6155,916806,13507582,2014-05-29,10780770,Olga,"Nice place, very clean and comfortable! Amazing view from the terrace where you can sit with a cup of your morning coffee and dream about something pleasant!"
6156,916806,13602797,2014-06-01,11509952,Ludger,"Netter, vor allem auch zuverlässiger Gastgeber.  Appartement liegt zwar 20 Bahnminuten außerhalb, aber der Blick auf die Schären macht das wieder wett. Sauber, gut ausgestattet und große Terrasse für lange Sommersonnenabende. Wer nicht nur die City sucht, ist hier bestens aufgehoben"
6157,916806,13760426,2014-06-03,10723626,Millie,"Lovely clean apartment,really enjoyed our stay! 
"
6158,916806,13812261,2014-06-05,12563598,Viktoryia,"Very-very-very nice place! The apartment is very beautiful and nice equipped.
It is situated in a very cosy green area. It takes about 30 minutes to get the city centre. Mansour is very hospitable. I've never seen before such a good apartment and host. I recommend it and hope to stay there in future."
6159,916806,14218007,2014-06-15,10966481,Burkhard,Mit meinem Vermieter habe ich einen guten Kontakt gehabt.Sie waren beide sehr zuvorkommend.Die Umgebung entsprach meinen Erwartungen.Von seiner Wohnung hat man einen wundervollen Blick auf die Schären.
6160,916806,14549334,2014-06-22,9118286,Josée,L'appartement est tout neuf dans un très beau site mais a 30 minutes du centre en métro. Toutes les commodités sont a 10min de marche. Idéal pour un couple. Les hôtes sont très gentils. 
6161,916806,14781847,2014-06-26,7460395,Trellis,A bit far from metro station. The next room is under renovation.  Overall the appartment is good.
6162,916806,15444808,2014-07-09,13771344,Francois,"Logement agréable et spacieux, idéal pour un couple. Le quartier est calme et très verdoyant. Les hôtes étaient malheureusement absents lors de  notre séjour mais ils ont toujours été joignable et très prévenant. Je le recommande vivement malgré son éloignement relatif du centre de stockholm. Le réseau de transport en commun permet finalement de pouvoir se balader dans les environs sans perdre trop de temps."
6163,916806,17202106,2014-08-09,3507398,Jan,"Het contact met Mansour was goed en prettig. Hoewel het appartement kleiner is dan de foto's doen vermoeden (meest geschikt voor twee personen vinden we, gezien de ene open ruimte) en het 'main terrass' van de uitzichtsfoto niet bij het appartement hoort, is de prijs/kwaliteit verhouding prima in orde. Een net en compleet appartement, een mooie locatie en Stockholm is goed te bereizen.  "
6164,916806,17675144,2014-08-16,10634882,Fabrice,Nous avons été très bien accueillis par Mansour. La vue vers le lac Mälaren est magnifique depuis la terrasse. Le studio était parfait pour nous deux et nos deux enfants (8 et 10 ans). Le métro est à 10 minutes à pied (il faut compter 25 minutes de métro pour rejoindre le centre-ville). On peut également profiter de la forêt et d'une plage au bord du lac. Petites améliorations à apporter au niveau du confort du studio mais nous avons passé un très bon séjour.
6165,916806,18051907,2014-08-21,11098898,Diego,"La estancia en casa de Mansour fue agridulce. El apartamento está muy bien equipado. Una tostadora le vendría muy bien. El apartamento es nuevo y muy luminoso con vistas desde la terraza a un lago. La comunicación con el centro de Estocolmo es fácil a través del metro. Hasta ahí todo bien, pero nos sentimos muy preocupados y molestos cuando injustamente se nos acusó de una cosa que no habíamos hecho, concretamente echar una gasa sanitaria en el inodoro. Leímos las instrucciones en el dossier y ponía que en sanitario se echará solamente el papel sucio. Encima del sanitario decía que no se echase ningún papel dentro. Solamente echamos varios papeles sucios el primer día. Nunca tela sanitaria, que no tenemos. Esta acusación injusta afectó especialmente a mi mujer que estuvo todo el tiempo preocupada e inquieta. Por lo demás, bien. El trato con Mansour, correcto."
6166,916806,18261540,2014-08-24,1249069,Gabriel,"Overall mitigated experience, maybe by comparison with the previous places we stayed at. The studio is clean and well equipped but is not very soundproof (there was a party upstairs one of the evenings). The location in itslef is also nice, with a great view and nice private terrace, but the neighborhood does not particularly invite to walks outside. Finally, our host answered all of our questions, but sometimes at the last moment (details for our arrival)."
6167,916806,18523271,2014-08-28,15344712,Stephanie,Sehr guter Kontakt zu den Vermietern. Die Wohnung entsprach unseren Erwartungen und war sauber und modern eingerichtet. Von der Wohnung hat man einen wunderschönen Blick auf die Schären.
6168,916806,19294896,2014-09-09,16965399,Diego,Beautiful apartment and location is terrific. The host was very helpful and was always at hand to provide any support.
6169,916806,19675232,2014-09-16,10190929,Courtney,Mansour was a very easy going host. He answered any question we had. The place is cozy and was perfect for the two of us! We enjoyed being away from the city which was only a 10 minute walk away. The view is quite beautiful and many places to take nice walks. I would definitely stay again. and public transportation was real easy. we enjoyed our stay very much!  
6170,916806,20032788,2014-09-22,20341079,Анна,"The listing description is accurate. The surrounding is  very nice.  10 minutes  by foot to the metro station and 15 minutes by metro to the center of the city.  
Mansour answered my e-mails very quickly.  
We had self check in and self check out. No issues  with that."
6171,916806,20527915,2014-09-30,21436552,Andrew,"We stayed at Mansours apartment from 25th-29th September 2014 whilst visiting a friend in Stockholm.
Mansour greeted us when we arrived. He was very friendly and provided us with information about the local area.
The apartment was very comfortable, clean, peaceful and well placed for visiting Stockholm by train (only 20 minutes to the centre of town)
It well also well placed for IKEA and a big retail complex at Kungens Kurva (only 5 minutes by car).
This was our first booking through Airbnb and went without a hitch. We recommend this apartment.
"
6172,916806,20924927,2014-10-07,3839842,Guzel,"The apartment was even better than I expected according to photos provided in the website. Light, clean, comfortable. 

It has everything you need to enjoy your stay - washing machine, iron, coffee machine and etc., that is not possible to have in the hotels. The building and area itself is really cool and calm! 

The only thing it's quite far away from the metro station.  

I'd recommend staying at this place. "
6173,916806,21475961,2014-10-18,20248055,Haowei,"Mansour is fast on responding and give good instruction of the facility. The apartment itself is nice, clean and very well equipped and the view over the sea is wonderful. I very much enjoys the greens and the cozy neighborhood. It is nevertheless a bit hard to find and needs a bit of a walking from the station (10-15 mins).

"
6174,916806,23366510,2014-11-30,21902458,Marina,"The best host ever! We had such a wonderful time. Everything was just perfect. The apartment is very nice, clean, warm, with all the equipment we've need and in the quiet and beautiful neighbourhood. Mansour and Julia are really so nice people, always ready to help with anything. My husband and I were there with our little son (2 years old) and he likes to be loud very often and we know that maybe sometimes he has waked them up :) but they didn't say a word, they were full of understanding. They have even put the warning sign on the main door that there is a baby... We stayed positively speechless. I could write until tomorrow because we're full of positive impressions... Really all the best! Thank you once again for everything, for very nice month spent in Stockholm in a beautiful accommodation where we've felt like at home! Thank you for your kindness, understanding, for being such warm persons. Just stay the way you are. I hope we'll see you again!  Best regards! "
6175,916806,24027786,2014-12-17,10780770,Olga,It was our second time at Mansour's place. We love the apartments and view from the terrace. Mansour and Julia are very kind and helpful hosts. Highly recommend this place.

6180,916806,29752033,2015-04-12,9083550,Markus,"Leider konnten wir die Gastgeber nicht kennenlernen, da Julia und Mansour selber im Urlaub waren. Die Kommunikation lief dennoch perfekt, von der Beschreibung zum CheckIn oder die Beantwortung unserer Fragen... alles spitze."
6181,916806,30340586,2015-04-20,30480136,Antoine,A very nice stay at Mansour's place. Everything was nice and tidy. Our hosts were always available and we spend 4 wonderful days. Thank you again.
6182,916806,30919990,2015-04-29,6664914,Abigail,"My Husband and I stayed at the apartment for 5 nights, part of our 16 day Scandinavian trip.

Upon first arrival, the apartment is located with beautiful scenic views and refurbished to high standards. It was clean and well organised. Mansour was quick at responding to any enquiries that we had.

Unfortunately, the apartment was not equipped for our basic needs and requires some thorough updating. Some examples are: No toaster, no oven (Microwave oven only), overrused and damaged pots/pans and cutlery, lack of toilet roll supply, etc.

We felt that the place hadn't been updated for almost 2 years. For a self-catering option, we were very limited."
6183,916806,31594961,2015-05-07,7539444,Muhammad,It is a nice accommodation in a residential community. The apartment is new and clean with all facility.  Linen is very basic and not pressed. All other things are very good 
6184,916806,31794282,2015-05-10,26792815,Dmitry,"The apartment is fully consistent with the description and photo. Very calm and quiet area. Nearby are many shops and shopping centers. The city center is 15 minutes by car. Mansour and Julia are very welcoming and friendly hosts. They provided advice on the apartment and the area nearby, which was very nice. 
We had a great time in Stockholm and our stay in this apartment was very pleasant for us."
6185,916806,32468088,2015-05-18,9843707,Danielle,"Mansour has we to give numerous very precise details to arrive at his apartment as well as the price lists of taxis... The accommodation is good, very clean, equipped well with a beautiful green environment. Mansour was very thoughtful and discreet."
6186,916806,32945347,2015-05-23,1008559,Michael,"Pros-A very nice and clean place to stay, feels very safe also. Mansour was very easy to communicate with even with our last minute booking. Lots of nearby places to buy supplies, very very good view and close to nature

Cons- a good 30 minutes by walk+ train to the city, if you miss the last bus during the evening you would have to walk back and it could be hard with some steep climbs and cold weather. 

Overall, would return and recommend to others :)"
6187,916806,33441250,2015-05-28,19768602,Agnes,We had a wonderful time in Stockholm and we liked very much the appartment of Mansour. It is beatifully located at the edge of Skarholmen so very close to nature. Mansour was helpful and there was a nice information packet in the appartment which was veryuseful. 
6188,916806,33761804,2015-06-01,13350128,Debra,"Mansour was the perfect host. Thankyou for being so accommodating and informative. Cannot be faulted.
Beautiful location and access to city was very straight forward using public transport. Our apartment was adequate and clean. "
6189,916806,34791083,2015-06-12,31420698,Shana,"The apartment was clean and the directions that we were given made finding the location relatively easy.  The view from the patio/yard was fabulous.
There are not many cooking utensils available (one pot, one pan) and the oven is really more of a microwave.
The bed and sofa-bed were very comfortable.
The neighbors are a bit noisy during the early evening, but the neighborhood gets very quiet in the later hours.
The distance to the grocery store and metro is short and easy to get to.  The ride on the metro to City Center takes a little bit of time."
6190,916806,35996965,2015-06-24,24663252,Hinrich,"It was a very nice stay in your apartment. We felt like at home. It was everything we needed and the location was perfect for us. As we were with our car in Stockholm there was good shopping possibilities. Also was the information we had received from Mansour very good and helpful. If we get back to Stockholm we will book the apartment again.
Thanks and best regards
Hinrich"
6191,916806,36540651,2015-06-29,26435794,Philip,"Nice place, quiet and really nice view of the area. Close to bus and train stations so transport is convenient. Huge shopping mall within walking distance.
The studio apartment was just the right size for the two of us. It was clean and tidy and had everyone we need.
Mansour was a great host, providing an information pack on arrival so everything was explained. He was also very prompt with his responses whenever we had a question.
Highly recommended."
6192,916806,37450535,2015-07-07,18133740,Christian,Great place with a good location. The apartment is well equiped and cozy.

6194,916806,39006102,2015-07-20,33218946,Jessica,"This place is amazing! Mansour was not in town when we got there but made sure we had everything we needed in advance which was great. The location was beautiful, far enough out of town that it wasn't crowded and a lot of traffic but close enough we could drive anywhere we wanted within about 10 minutes. The apartment itself is beautiful. It was extremely clean and well maintained. We stayed during the time of the midnight sun and the blinds kept it nice and dark for us at night. It was furnished with everything we could have needed. The one and only downside was you had to walk up hill to get there from the parking lot, and it's not even a big hill, we were just tired a lot from jet lag. That is the only negative I could ever say about this place. If we ever come back we will definitely stay here again and I will recommend this place to anyone. "
6195,916806,40554966,2015-08-01,26532870,Saskia,"Mansour und Julia waren leider selbst im Urlaub, so dass wir sie nicht persönlich getroffen haben. Der Kontakt war im Vorfeld aber sehr gut und auch während unseres Aufenthalts haben wir bei Nachfragen schnelle eine Antwort bekommen. In der Wohnung sind alle notwendigen Informationen hinterlassen.
Die Wohnung selbst ist sauber und für einen Kurzaufenthalt gut ausgestattet. Zu Bus- und U-Bahn-Haltestellen ist es nicht weit. Große Shopping-Malls erreicht man mit dem Auto innerhalb von 10 Minuten.
Kleine Kritikpunkte: Die Jalousien reichen nicht aus, um die Wohnung nachts komplett abzudunkeln. 
Die Pumpe ist sehr laut. Man hört sie immer wenn Wasser abgelassen wird, auch wenn die Nachbarn in der oberen Etage Waser laufen lassen. Nachts ist es besonders nervig.
Die Bewohner in der Wohnung drüber waren ab dem frühen Abend sehr laut (Trampeln, Musik). Dies war fast täglich bis ca. 23 Uhr Standard. 
Ansonsten ist die Wohnung weiterzuempfehlen und für 2-5 Tage würden wir sie wieder buchen.

Nous avons même eu la chance de croiser bambi ! =)
Tout proche de stockholm. Appartement idéal pour jeune couple en vacances comme nous."
6197,916806,42249024,2015-08-12,29276187,Tobias,"Wir haben die Gastgeber nicht persönlich angetroffen, da diese selbst im Urlaub waren. Auf Anfragen vor und im Urlaub Haben sie jedoch schnell geantwortet. Die bus und u-Bahn Haltestelle ist nicht weit entfernt. Man hat einen sehr schönen Ausblick von der Terrasse. Die Wohnung war sehr ordentlich und sauber."
6198,916806,42866987,2015-08-16,28539630,Franz,"Appartement is ok, but a litten bit far from town but with Metro no bigger Problem. 
Neighborhood is very multi-kulti.. and sundown on the terrace spectactulos.."
6199,916806,44106916,2015-08-24,33367538,Christof,Die Unterkunft war in einem tadellosen Zustand und wie in der Beschreibung. Der Kontakt mit Mansour war sehr freundlich. Er war jederzeit erreichbar und versuchte uns persönlich kennenzulernen. Wir haben vor allem die große Terrasse und den wundervollen Ausblick genossen.
6200,916806,44722150,2015-08-28,14127737,Marek,"We had very nice stay in the apartment. The place was very clean and  fully equipped to our needs. Also the communication with Mansour was perfectly smooth. Overall, I wished we had more time to spent in the Mansour`s place."
6201,916806,49098238,2015-10-01,35215096,Vanessa,"Mansour was a great host. His instructions to get to the place were very detailed and accurate, and the place was kept clean. He was always extremely quick to respond to my questions and he would check in to make sure there was nothing I needed. It was a great stay."
6202,916806,53115616,2015-11-05,22778278,Oles,Mansour's and Julia's apartment was very modern and made for a very comfortable stay in Stockholm.  The apartment is located in a very nice neighborhood not too far from the city and has all needed amenities nearby.  The guidebook left my Mansour and Julia really helped to orient us around the neighborhood.
6203,916806,53878442,2015-11-14,42766632,Jephtan,"Très belle appartement bien agencer dans une résidence super calme à quelques pas du centre ville ainsi que le métro pour stockholm. 
Les hôtes ont toujours répondu à mes attentes afin que mon séjour soit le plus agréable possible. 
Je recommande cette appartement"
6204,916806,54114645,2015-11-16,21222084,Corinna,"Die Wohnung ist gut aufgeteilt und sauber. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt. Den angekündigten Panorama View kann man von der oberen Terasse draußen genießen, aber nicht von der Wohnung im Souterrain.
Die Wegbeschreibung hätte noch etwas genauer sein können. Die Nachbarschaft ist eine nette Wohngegend mit kleinen Holzhäusern."
6205,916806,62488500,2016-02-15,23696507,Yilang,"The house was clean and furnished well(kitchen, closet, air warmer, etc.). The host's feedback was fast and kind. 

We knew that we lost our baby's bracelet there and asked Mansour, even we left the place, he gave very rapid feedback not to make us be concerned about it. Forturnately found it in our package and I appreciate mansour for rapid feedback much.
Bus station is close(3 mins by walk) and large malls were near the house. And because of playgrounds near there, my baby could spend good time there with us."
6206,916806,63159471,2016-02-21,47040295,Hollie,"A really lovely place to stay! Only 20 minutes on the metro out of Stockholm, it gives you the opportunity to be out in the country but close enough to the city. The neighbourhood is very quiet but has all the shops you need just down the road! If you had any problems Mansour or Julia would reply very efficiently to make sure you are happy! They also provided a very useful booklet full of local information. I would definitely recommend this place to stay as it is in a lovely location and it is warm and very comfortable. The only negative is that it was slightly unclear where the best place for parking was as we had a hire car. "
6207,916806,63905643,2016-02-28,47923326,Mattias,"Before we arrived Mansour was very accommodating and answered all of our questions about the place and specifically about bringing our 6-month old son. He communicated quickly and effectively using the AirBnB messaging.

The flat itself was spacious, clean and modern, and we loved having the terrace. We took a lovely walk down to the frozen lake to watch the sunset. The flat is very close to the Underground Station and we walked there with the pushchair in about 10 minutes. We had everything we needed in the flat including a travel cot. 

All in all we had a lovely time, thank you for having us."
6208,916806,65267746,2016-03-12,24408397,Aaron,I'm happy with the stay. Slept good and everything worked out well. 
6209,916806,65533774,2016-03-15,54205866,Oliver,It was a perfect staying at this lovely place. We enjoyed it very much and we love to come back soon.
6210,916806,66997138,2016-03-26,55142865,Amanda,"We enjoyed our time at Mansour and Julia's flat very much. It is as lovely in person, as it does in the picturs. It's small, but has space enough to store everything and we were comfortable with two adults and two so children. 
The neighborhood is great. Shopping, public transport, and nature! 
Hopefully this won't be our last trip to Stockholm! We would definitely stay here again."
6211,916806,67841377,2016-03-31,46092914,Michael,"A well appointed, spacious and comfortable place to stay with a short walk to a local shopping centre and Skarholmen metro station to get into Stockholm city. (It takes about 30 mins total.) Our hosts provided very detailed and timely instructions for self check-in and the apartment was clean and neatly presented. It appeared as expected and we enjoyed our time there; it is particularly quiet and peaceful. Both our hosts made themselves available throughout our stay."
6212,916806,68692343,2016-04-06,54384299,Benno,"A verry well organised apartment. We had a great stay. Only a few minutes walk from the shops and the metro. To the city center it takes approx 20 minutes with the metro.p
Two points: 1. for the view on the lake you have to go outside and 2.  the pump is rather noisy even at night. Perhaps some isolation will help."
6213,916806,68895025,2016-04-07,27164930,Sous Le Soleil Gascon,"This is a beautiful apartment in a very interesting location. Inside it is very stylish with everything we needed, a well equipped kitchen, a comfortable living and sleeping area, and a good shower room. The views from the decking of the trees and water were amazing. The local area has plenty of shops and cafes, and the metro service takes you into the city centre quickly and efficiently. All communication with Mansour was friendly and helpful, and we arrived and left with no problems at all.  I would recommend this apartment, it is superb value for money and both comfortable and stylish."
6214,916806,69419117,2016-04-11,54084969,Thomas,"L'appartement est en tout point conforme à la description et dans un état impeccable. Tout est réuni pour passer un merveilleux séjour et ce fut le cas pour nous. Proche de toutes les commodités, une vue magnifique... bref à recommander vivement!"
6215,916806,69733535,2016-04-13,16091004,Stefanie,"Mansour gave us a really detailed explanation to find the apartment outside of the centre of Stockholm. So it was really easy to find and to check in. We were totally impressed by the view when we arrive. The sunset at the lake was amazing. 
The apartment is modern (as shown in the pics) and clean. We found everything we need to cook in the kitchen. 
The neighborhood was sweet and silent. So its perfect if you want to escape the rush in the city centre, relax a bit and to see a lot of Swedens typical red wooden houses.  "
6216,916806,70181818,2016-04-16,55778208,Sungho,"I am so thank u of ur help.
The bed is so convinent to use and interior is also perfect.
Unfortunately, we could not see beautiful animals near the house.
But scenery was really nice."

Le quartier est calme et vous trouverez pleins d'air de jeux pour les enfants.
Nous avons été accueilli par Julia qui est une personne très sympa.
Nous avons profité de leurs bons plans. Nous sommes tombés le samedi de l'année où plusieurs musés sont gratuits à Stockholm de 18h à minuit (merci Julia pour cette information!).
Pour tout nos mails ou messages envoyés, nous avons reçu une réponse rapide. 
Merci à vous deux."

War alles so , wie auch vorher angekündigt.
Jederzeit wieder ;-)

6220,916806,73431261,2016-05-08,29017104,Andrea,"Die Beschreibung der Unterkunft war korrekt. Die Wohnung ist in Ordnung und sauber und gut eingerichtet, ideal für 2 Personen, für 4 ist sie etwas eng. Störend ist das überlaute Geräusch der Wasserpumpe im WC und die Überbewertung der 5 „holy rools“.
"
6221,916806,74011408,2016-05-12,70670955,Stephan,"The apartment was really nice, fully and modern equipped and very clean. In addition to that, we had a good connection to Stockholm city via public transportation system. It took us as long as Mansour wrote in his description. We enjoyed our stay very much and would come back again."
6222,916806,74361669,2016-05-15,14618259,Elisabeth,"Mansour is a five-star-host, very helpful and friend-ly! The apartement is just as described: a unique place! Nothing is missing, and we've had there a dreamful time. The location of the apartment is the perfect blend of closeness to nature and close to the city. When I come to Stockholm for the next time, I want to live here again! Thanks to Mansour & Julia..."
6223,916806,74923848,2016-05-17,33140062,Emma,We absolutely loved it here! It was clean and in such a beautiful area. It's close to the lake and the town square. Thank you!
6224,916806,76433517,2016-05-27,29549597,Tanja,"It was an unforgettable 7 days in Stockholm. The apartment is more than excellent. Mansour and Julia took care to make you feel home and that anything that you need, you can turn on them. The apartment has everything, everything is very clean and the location is wonderful. Every morning I drank coffee on the terrace with a view of the lake and this beautiful landscape. I recommend this apartment to all. Even the subway is a 10 minute walk and then by metro, 20 minutes to the central station. I will certainly come back! :) Tack, tack so mycket :) "
6225,916806,77374887,2016-05-31,24459389,Hasan,"Close to the city centre. The apartment is quite nice. It has a separate entry. The complex has visitor parking spots. The place is good for those who rent a car. When we were going to downtown, we took the metro. It was a short walk from the apartment and it was really really convenient (you could also take a bus to the metro station). By the metro station, there is a mall with a couple of large grocery stores. Mansour was considerate and responsive. He provided the check-in instructions in advance. He also asked us if we needed anything after we checked in. He allowed us to check in a couple of hours earlier than the usual check-in time. Overall, I recommend the apartment to others. Given the rate, the apartment is a good bargain."
6226,916806,77695527,2016-06-02,48999078,Han-Ping,"Although we didn't see the host, the host gave us all the  clear information ,and replied our question in a very short time.The room is also very clean and nice!Really enjoy staying at this house !"
6227,916806,78845058,2016-06-09,22762269,Patric,"This place is a perfect combination of beautiful nature, calmness and close to the Stockholm. The checkin and checkout procedure is very easy and cost you nearly no time. As we arrived we did a walk to the nice beach at Skärholmen. You can go easily by T-bana to Stockholm in 20 minutes. Coming back is like entering another world. Immediatley after the metro station Skärholmen and a 10 minutes walk you are in the nice and always calm community area, where the apartment is located. The morning and afternoon sun you can enjoy at the lovely yard. The view at the second yard (neighbors) is amazing and we will never forgot it. Everything in the apartment is well organized and we missed nothing. This was a really awesome stay at Stockholm. "
6228,916806,79685263,2016-06-13,25291856,Jessie,"Mansour's appartment is beautiful, very well presented and very clean and it had everything we needed. The area of the location itself is beautiful, with a stunning view of the lake from the terrace, which you can walk down to. There's a little beach, some BBQ areas and a forest that is great for exploring. The apartment is located in a very quiet housing area, and is very peaceful. However it is a good 20 minute metro ride to the centre, so take this into account if you want to be central. Overall we had a very enjoyable stay and although we didn't see Mansour he was a very helpful and welcoming host. "
6229,916806,80054446,2016-06-15,66353480,Alexis,"Julia & Mansour are the best!
They are ALWAYS aware of any need you may have.
Their place is beautiful, you feel Like at home.
I recommend them a lot!"

6231,916806,81576975,2016-06-23,52735170,Sarah,We loved the apartment. It is in a really nice area outside of the city which we loved. The handbook that we were given was very detailed and gave us all the information we needed.
6232,916806,83579687,2016-07-03,53468459,Ute,"Das Haus liegt sehr idyllisch in einer reinen Wohngegend. Das Appartment ist recht grosszügig und für 2 Personen auch für mehrere Tage sehr gut nutzbar. Alle notwendigen Geräte und Utensilien zum Kochen sind vorhanden. Wir haben nichts vermisst. Die grosse Holzveranda lädt zu langen Aufenthalten im Sommer ein und man kann den Sonnenuntergang in vollen Zügen geniessen. In 15 Minuten ist man zu Fuss an der U-Bahnstation und von da an in ca. 40 Minuten mitten im Herzen von Stockholm. Die Wohngegend ist sehr, sehr ruhig, also sehr gut geeignet um nach einer ausgiebigen Sightseeing-Tour in der Stadt den Tag in aller Ruhe ausklingen zu lassen. Die Dokumentation ist sehr ausführlich beschrieben und der Check-In ist anhand der detaillierten Beschreibung einfach zu bewerkstelligen. Trotz Ferienabwesenheit war die Kommunikation gewährleistet und hat super geklappt."
6233,916806,84516583,2016-07-07,26450707,Yvonne,"Mansour återkoppla direkt vid ev frågor och vid bokning. Beskrivelsen av lägenhet och self check in, var enkelt och följa, samt väldigt bra sammanställt.
Vi var mycket nöjda med vår vistelse här i Skärholmen"

6235,916806,87171676,2016-07-18,22709012,Uwe,"Mansour hat alles dafür getan, um sich in seinem Appartement wohl zu fühlen. Die Beschreibung der Unterkunft passte zu dem, was wir vorgefunden haben und ist für einen Aufenthalt mit zwi, max. drei Personen perfekt. Es gab eine sehr gute Wegbeschreibung für die Ankunft am Flughafen zur Unterkunft. Die Fahrzeiten mit der U Bahn passten genau, allerdings möchte man die Entfernungen am Tag vielleicht nicht zweimal zurücklegen, insbesondere von Skärholmen zur Unterkunft. Die Unterkunft ist sehr ruhig im Grünen gelegen, zum See mit Bademöglichkeit sind es zu Fuß ca. 20 Minuten."
6236,916806,89090090,2016-07-26,58044291,Stephan,"we had a pleasant stay and enjoyed it. We have never met Mansour but during the e-mail conversations he was very kind and helpful and we could find the apartment easily with his description. 
The panoramic view was very beautiful but unfortunately just from the apartment above our apartment. 
The toilet was constantly losing water and that caused the drain pump to work also during the night we could`t sleep well because the drain pump was very noisy."
6237,916806,92730324,2016-08-09,44556246,Francky,"A 25mn du centre de Stockholm en métro, arrêt de bus pour rejoindre la station au pied de l'appartement. Une magnifique terrasse avec une vue sur la baltique. Une plage à 15mn à pied, des centres commerciaux, la zone d'Ikea Kungens à une station de bus. L'appartement est très fonctionnel, une adresse à retenir pour un super séjour à Stockolm. A conseiller sans modération !!"

6244,916806,98849183,2016-09-02,33340936,Sebastian,Mansour & Julia haben alles dafür getan unseren Aufenthalt so angenehm wie möglich zu gestalten. Die Kommunikation lief reibungslos und in der Wohnung sind alle nötigen Informationen vorhanden.  Auch die Ausstattung ist modern und ansprechend. Die Nachbarschaft ist ruhig und auch Einkaufsmöglichkeiten sind in der Nähe vorhanden. Wenn man nicht gerade spät abends zurück kommt sind auch ausreichend kostenfreie Parkplätze vorhanden. Die direkte Nähe zur Natur und die gelegentlichen Besuche von Rehen im Garten sind eine schöne Abwechslung. Wir können die Unterkunft nur weiterempfehlen und werden auch gerne wiederkommen.
6245,916806,99795367,2016-09-05,44663631,Mia,Very clean and lovely place with enough space and everything you need to have a nice stay. Be aware of the drain pump that is used so aboud throwing anything into the WC and get used to the sound when it is draining (can be loud if someone uses it at night). Unfortunately we didnt make it to the lake but it sure looked beautiful from the distance. There are supermarkets and a great mall in a walking distance which we liked very much.
6246,916806,101189241,2016-09-12,49347779,Tim,"First things first: everything was at its place and absolutely clean and also new. Checkin without problems. Communication was quick and very customer centric. Location is a good bargain for a two adults ""city hopper"" setting.

Unfortunately we arrived with 2 adults and 2 little children. Therefor it wasn't the right fit. I recommend to:

1) not rent appartment for more than two people or 2 adults & 1 child. Especially if you plan to stay longer than 3-4 nights. Room is not 50sqm, 1-room-appartment, Windows only at the frontside, very small bathroom without window,...

2) not stick 100% to text and images of description. Appartment is rather a refurbished souterrain/cellar than first floor. Hence a drain pump is needed for each wastewater transportation, which ends up in loud noises while working. Additionally you will hear each and every activity of people living in the appartment above. Both is particularly disturbing at night and in the evening hours while kids are trying to sleep. Pictures and description where made from a strong marketing perspective.

3) not expect too much from surrounding. It is okay, but less ""fantastic"" and ""unique"" as written within description. Please find more about Skarholmen itself at Wikipedia, aso.! Beside the calm and child friendly small chain house area you will find a lot of concrete, e.g. if walking to train station. 

4) make sure you are willing to travel a bit into the city center as appartment is some kilometers in the suburbs (as described by the owners)."

Mansour is kind and helpful. because the house were ran out of water one day in some reasons, but Mansour just drove us to her apartment to take a shower and prepare lots of drinking water to us for the next day. 
Very appreciate it and definitely recommend this place !"

I specifically did not want to stay in the centre of Stockholm so the location was ideal. It was nice to come back to (and wake up to) a peaceful, scenic slice of Stockholm. The hosts were ever so helpful and the instructions / map they sent beforehand were detailed and informative. I would definitely love to come back!"

Sehr schöne Wohnung, sehr ruhig, lediglich das Bad ist etwas klein und das Geräusch der Wasserpumpe gewöhnungsbedürftig. Aber dafür ist man in einer Öko-Siedlung, die sich sehr positiv von dem, das man sonst von Stockholm an Wohngebieten sieht, unterscheidet. Stockholm-City ist mit dem Auto von dort gut erreichbar. "

6260,916806,114046908,2016-11-15,100041764,Valerie,"We booked the apartment for 3 nights for our trip to Stockholm and had a pleasant stay. The apartment was exactly as shown in the pictures and has a perfect size for 2-3 people. 
The apartment is newly renovated and the kitchen is fully equipped with anything thats needed. 
It is located a bit outside of the city center, but is easily to reach with public transportation (20min subway ride, 10min walk to the apartment itself). By arriving without a car, i can recommend to take the bus from the subway station instead of walking with the luggage because its going quiet uphill.

6262,916806,116389017,2016-11-30,97594744,Demian,"Schöne, kleine Wohnung im Stadtteil Skärholmen, Stockholm. Circa 8min zu Fuss zu diversen Einkaufsmöglichkeiten und zur Metro ( 20min Fahrt ins Stadtzentrum). Die Wohnung ist sehr gemütlich und gut ausgestattet, sehr sauber und gleich neben dem Meer. Sehr zu empfehlen. Mansour und Julia sind sehr freundliche Leute und allgemein der ganze Ablauf ging Reibungslos vonstatten. Ideal für Reisende, die auch ein wenig mehr Natur um sich haben möchten, aber trotzdem nach einer Wohnung in Stadtnähe ausschau halten."
6263,916806,120149679,2016-12-08,97823824,Federico,Simply super! 
6264,916806,121471374,2016-12-17,24960723,Eunice,"Very cosy and residential area - my friends and I drove so not much to say about public transit. Driving-wise, it was easy to locate using (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps. Very lovely and scenic, what more with the snow during winter. Things were very clean and instructions were very clear so at no point did we feel lost or unsure or uneasy about anything. We enjoyed this very much!"
6265,916806,122242618,2016-12-22,91783314,Irene,"Het appartement ligt op de rand van een buitenwijk met mooi uitzicht. Het is niet groot maar schoon, compleet en perfect voor 2 personen. 15 minuten lopen naar de winkels en een goed Metronetwerk en dus prima. De 3 dagenkaart is een voordelige manier om rond te reizen door Stockholm en alle eilandjes te ontdekken. Om die redenen een goed adres! "
6266,916806,123600767,2016-12-29,30165496,Isobel,"Staying here made our Christmas very special as the lovely apartment was only 5 minutes walking from our daughter's apartment. It was a calm, spotlessly clean, comfortable place to come home to after the busyness of a family Christmas. We slept incredibly well every night!

This area is full of lovely walks to and near the lake and the apartment is part of a number of well looked after landscaped "" chain"" or "" semi-detached"" homes set high above the lake. There's a big deck outside which will be great to use for eating on or relaxing in the summer. 

The Skarholmen Shopping Centre sells everything one might need. The bus service to the Centre is very reliable as is the metro into the centre of beautiful Stockholm. We love going into the many amazing Museums and sites there.

We would definitely rent this apartment again in the future."
6267,916806,125849806,2017-01-07,7319654,Loick,"Mansour's flat is well located in a very peaceful neighborhood, close to the nature, forests and lakes. We had a pleasant stay and had a good break in Sweden ! For those who want to go to Stockholm downtown, you have a direct line with the metro."
6268,916806,138251854,2017-03-19,5267639,Pierre-Colin,L'appartement que nous avons eu n'est pas celui de l'annonce suite à un problème d'eau peu de temps avant le départ. Julia et Mansour nous ont proposés un autre appartement certes plus petit mais très propre et agréable. Ils ont répondu à nos questions et nos demandes très rapidement. Je conseille les hôtes et leur appartement !
6269,916806,139379051,2017-03-25,57088818,Suki,The apartment is good and comfortable.
6270,916806,139957808,2017-03-27,76069366,Daniel,Cozy and comfortable apartment. Surrounded area has a great view. Check-in procedure is also simple and easy. 
6271,916806,140686726,2017-03-31,10467127,Doug,Nice clean comfortable apartment. Especially liked the comfortable bed and the great shower (good water pressure). 
6272,916806,141155720,2017-04-02,83744875,Dylan,This was a great apartment. There was a beautiful view and only a short walk to the train station. Very convenient! Julia was an amazing host that provided me with a lot of information on transportation and the local area. She had a self check in service that was extremely convenient. 
6273,916806,142033524,2017-04-06,120202522,Oliver,"Really nice house away from the city centre. The hosts are very accommodating and got back to us very quickly when we were having a problem with the wi fi. 

One of the nicest things about the property is the locality to the lake and the garden path that runs alongside it. Great for going on a early morning run or a setting a picnic in the late afternoon. "
6274,916806,145431983,2017-04-18,2507463,Susana,"It's been a very good stay at Julia's house. The apartment is cozy and comfortable and it's very well equipped. We did the check-in by ourselves with the procedure that Julia sent to us and it was really easy, we didn't have any problem."
6275,916806,146465294,2017-04-23,90374669,Valérie,"Nous avions réservé ce logement pour un long We à Stockholm. Comme l'hôte l'indique, il y a 1 métro à 10 min. de marche, lequel nous emmène en ville en 20 min. Nous avons apprécié ce trajet parmi les suédois, pour arriver dans un secteur très calme (parfait pour bien dormir après une longue journée de marche). "
6276,916806,150059096,2017-05-07,114714938,Daniel,"Logement bien situé, proche des transports tout en étant au calme. Possibilités de balades au bord du lac à proximité.
Studio propre, confortable et fonctionnel."

6278,916806,156348889,2017-05-30,81460880,A Leah,"This place was great - had everything we needed.  Quick walk to the train to get to downtown Stockholm.  All the house rules were detailed and we had a great time!  However, if you want to stay in Stockholm, this place is a bit more of a suburb so be sure to read their description!  "
6279,916806,157963488,2017-06-05,56876766,Mylène,Beau petit appartement fonctionnel situé dans un endroit calme à 15 minutes du métro. Julia répond rapidement en cas de besoin et est très aimable. Nous avons passé un très chouette séjour et y reviendrons volontiers. Merci Julia et Mansour.
6280,916806,161502548,2017-06-18,40181101,Daniela,"We had a four days stay at Julias place near to nature. We really recommend the apartment for people who want both: nature and city. We took the short cuts (as Julia described) into the city and to the beach - so there is nothing to criticize about the distance! In the evening we cooked and used the terasse - there we only missed comfy chairs to watch the sunset! Julia was easy to deal with and as we missed a second bedlinen on arrival, Julia took care of this problem immediately."
6281,916806,163062991,2017-06-23,31479562,Caoimhe,"Julia's place is a lovely, spacious and bright apartment. It is in a lovely, vibrant and multi-cultural area that has many different restaurants, a huge mall, a lidl and prisma grocery shop and market with fresh fruits and vegetables nearby and a train station about 15 minutes away walking.The kitchen is well equipped and was perfect for a short stay for 2-3/4 at a max people as it is a studio apartment with one double bed and one couch that pulls out to a double. The surroundings of the apartment are lovely and there is a generous sized patio with picnic bench furniture to sit out and enjoy the sun in. The train is the best way to get into Stockholm central and takes approx 25 minutes. "
6282,916806,164488030,2017-06-27,24680779,Lori,Nice and clean small space. Lovely decl to sit in the sun. Short drive to waters edge for a nice walk in nature. We had a car while here so about a 20minite drive to Stockholm and 5 minutes to nearest shopping centre. Not much to do in area but good base to travel out from. Julia was very responsive to our questions and lots of detailed information.
6283,916806,171182261,2017-07-17,112567771,Mario,Sehr gute Unterkunft. Preis/Leistung passt. 
6284,916806,173418113,2017-07-23,72066084,Johan,Emplacement très calme et à proximité du métro pour pouvoir bouger facilement ! Parfait pour un petit couple ou une petite famille

6286,916806,179237893,2017-08-07,25449736,Huib,Nice apartment 10 min walk from shops and subway that brings you to central Stockholm in 20 min.

Un patio magnífico donde poder estar y contemplar el lago incluso diferentes animales  .
Nosotros ibamoS en coche por lo que sin problema el ir a comprar al supermercado .
Julia nos dio la opción de.aparcar gratis y lo pudimos dejar prácticamente en la puerta.
Gracias Julia ! 
La Recomendaría."
6289,916806,184721051,2017-08-20,8913759,Prateek,"Julia's place is perfect if you want a great value outside of Stockholm central!  The apartment would be a bit cramped for 4 people but as I was staying here as a solo traveller, I found the apartment perfect for my needs.  The apartment comes nicely furnished and has everything you need to cook for yourself, wash your clothes, and entertain guests.  The bed is comfortable.  The bathroom small but adequate.  The location isn't the greatest but it is accurate in the listing description a 10-15 minute walk uphill from the Skarholmen T-bana station plus a  25 minute ride into central station.  I really appreciated the clear check-in instructions and general level of care that Julia took to ensure a pleasant stay.  Would stay again.

(A small note about the ""panaromic view"":  Yes there is a nice view from the edge of the deck outside, but it is not visible from inside the apartment or the apartment windows.)"
6290,916806,187395714,2017-08-27,81634598,Anna,Die Unterkunft von Julia hat eine tolle Lage wenn man einfach mal abschalten will und die Natur mag :) Man ist mit den Öffentlichen innerhalb von 40 min im Zentrum. Die Wohnung ist sehr modern und das einzige das gewöhnungsbedürftige ist die Wasserpumpe :D
6291,916806,195034352,2017-09-18,109094192,Joachim,"Julia's flat is perfect for a short or medium stay in Stockholm. The view from the terrace is amazing and gets you into the Swedish mood when you step outside. As a host, Julia and her husband are fast to answer to questions (like we that had problems opening the door - our own fault) and offer help.

The flat has everything needed and is optimal for 2 persons. There is a bus stop close by and the metro (take a 24 or 72 hour or a ticket for one week - it saves money) is either a walk or a short drive away (if you don't want to go uphill you can park at Skärholmen center for 50 SEK a day - very cheap). 

Talking about parking. It is easy to get guest parking from Julia. For us we had some problems because of a second car from our son that visited from Norway. The app for parking is not available on (Hidden by Airbnb) Play when you have a non Swedish phone. But you can find the APK from the parking company online ( (Hidden by Airbnb) ) and solve the problem with installing manually (just a tip).

We love Stockholm and the area around and when we come back we will look into this flat again. Highly recommended. Thanks for having us."
6292,916806,195936301,2017-09-21,106902640,Alison,"環境十分優靜,房間很大,開放式廚房很好用,只是淋浴的地方較細小,另外由車站步行至住宿的路段風景很怡人｡

The environment is very serene and peaceful. The room is comfy as shown in the pictures and the user-friendly kitchen facility providing a good chance for cooking. However, the showering area is rather small as expected. For the accessibility, although it is approx. 15mins distance from metro station, the walking path is flat and greenery."
6293,916806,199115899,2017-10-01,101856565,Dave,"Amazing place with awesome panorama view, apartement was nice and clean. Everything was exactly as i desired."
6294,916806,200181291,2017-10-04,95064689,Daniel,Det var lågt i tak och dåligt med toalettpapper. En pump väsnades varje gång man använde badrummet.
6295,916806,201837236,2017-10-09,87138764,Megan,Great value! It was nice to have all the green space around. I loved how dark the room was at night! As noted it's about 10 or so minutes from the metro station with a 20-25 minute metro ride. The metro ran frequently even on weekends so we were never waiting for a train long. Communication was great and we were able to check out a bit late to accommodate our late trip to the airport which made our day so much easier. All in all a lovely stay.
6296,916806,206189389,2017-10-24,90834069,Natalia,Lovely and clean apartment. Enough space for two adults with three small children. Easy access to the shops and public transport. Amazing view and quite area. Just what we needed it highly recommended!
6297,916806,207852383,2017-10-30,39915889,Liam,"Great stay, which id thoroughly recommend. Location is great if you want to stay in the suburbs and the studio flat itself is very clean and has everything you’d need. Great to come back to after a cold Swedish day! "

Proche du centre ville"

6300,916806,213831892,2017-11-23,47981129,Artem&Daria,"First of all, I want to thanks God that we are in a good health. It was our first time when we didn’t like the apartment at all. I am very upset to write that but this will help somebody in future. This is not an apartment as we thought, it is actually a basement (even a cellar), I could easily touch the ceilings by my head (I am not too tall). This basement has only one window that could be opened (but only for 5-10 cm), it has only two windows and the second one is covered with mold!!! I now the reason, but it must to be eliminated. The main reason is that this place doesn’t have heating at all!!!! There is an air-conditioner but it isn’t enough for a such cold place! There is a heat-insulated floor at the entrance, but it is one meter length-ways. The air-conditioner couldn’t reach the bathroom and the bed (you don’t have bedroom, it is right behind the cold wall). But the most terrifying things were THE SOUNDS! You can’t sleep due to loud sounds of the water system (I don’t know exactly what it was). We would never rent the «sharing» apartment in a basement or a cellar (even if I am a big fan of Harry Potter). The bathroom (the bath cabin) is moldy too, and it is need to be replace due to its old conditions. There was no soap neither in the kitchen nor in the bathroom (so we pour the shower gel). How stiff were the towels, like wooden.  The bed was cold and awful! We left with backache. And I am wonder, how old is the washcloth?
BTW, the Internet was awful too!
The location is perfect, but you won’t be able to admire this panoramic view from the apartment, it is wrong and confusing idea. It is 30 min from the old city center but we knew it, it is okay.
WARNING! If you are choosing «Entire place» in the Airbnb, check it because you may leave under somebody.
It is a case when the hosts want to get money but don’t want to do everything properly. Even the pan was in a bed condition (it couldn’t be damaged by gests because the place has an electric stove, and the damage is like from the gas stove). In Ukrainian we say «зроблено абияк, лише щоб відчепилися».
Three words: cold, dirty, bаd WIFI."
6301,916806,214526173,2017-11-26,153500216,Beatriz,"Logement non loin des transports en commun, comptez 20 minutes de métro pour regagner la capitale. 15 minutes de marche entre l'appartement et la station de métro, sinon vous pouvez prendre le bus (2 stations). Situé dans un coin calme, on aperçoit la nature suédoise au loin. L'appartement est propre et confortable. Chauffé et équipé. Seul le lit n'est pas très ferme."
6302,916806,217671769,2017-12-10,47089299,Brad,"Julia is an amazing host. Everything is laid out and planned in advance, she gives great local tips and the location is beautiful if you want a slice of Swedish countryside as well as great access to Stockholm!"
6303,916806,218656743,2017-12-14,150377102,Sailai,"Julia was very organized and made good arrangement of the transportation, including describing clear instruction of taking taxi at airport to her place with the fares and companies suggested as well as helping book the taxi to go back airport. Even though the location is already expected not in the downtown area, it was walkable to the metro/subway and to supermarket as well. Having a lot of funs at the yard to play snow and interactions between some kids living nearby. Overall, great value and money."
6304,916806,219366738,2017-12-17,75456953,Lola,Communication with Julia was very fluent although we didn’t actually meet. She gave us all the details to get to the flat and plenty of information on the area. The flat was spotless and very cosy. Strongly recommended!!
6305,916806,220902446,2017-12-24,149723568,Fred,A great location on top of the hill and a small distance to the Tunnelbana.
6306,916806,221939963,2017-12-28,156223723,Daniel,"Julia's place is great if you're looking for a quiet, modern spot away from central Stockholm. It is a redone studio below a larger house that is separate. It was very clean and comfortable with everything we needed. You can also check out the world's largest IKEA nearby!"
6307,916806,224797514,2018-01-04,145963641,Юлия,"Жили неделю в данных апартаментах. Очень понравилось. Находятся в живописном месте, вокруг природа и прекрасный вид с холма. Все что нужно есть. Идти от метро минут десять. Возле метро есть все магазины, какие только можно придумать. Очень рекомендуем!"
6308,916806,226351052,2018-01-10,17829124,Hugo,"Premier séjour à Stockholm. Le logement de Julia est vraiment super. Avec les transports ( Metro) on rejoint le centre ville en une vingtaine de minute. Le logement est vraiment parfait, le quartier et super mignon, la vue est magnifique. Nous reviendrons à Stockholm pour profiter de la ville mais également du quartier où se trouve le Airbnb. Les alentours ont l'air magnifiques."
6309,916806,227823840,2018-01-16,100819904,Juan Felipe,We had a nice time in Julias place. The apartment is confortable and clean. Julia was really nice and helped us with everyrhing we needed.

L'appartement n'est pas à côté de Stockholm mais avec un peu de patience il est aisé de rejoindre la ville avec le métro. Je recommande ce logement!
6312,916806,235352591,2018-02-16,83926051,Nora,"Die Unterkunft eignet sich für einen Besuch in Stockholm wunderbar. Mit der Bahn ist man gut angebunden an das Zentrum. Die Ausstattung der Wohnung beinhaltet alles, was man benötigt."
6313,916806,237037815,2018-02-21,157491912,Miguel,"Wonderful place with great sights to the water. Location is perfect if you like the suburbs with close walk to the subway (30min to city center and no transfers nevessary in subway lines). Everything is as described (including cooking utensils set for 4 persons) and Julia is a good host, excellent communication and the self check-in is very easy."

Nous avons particulièrement aimé l’équipement du studio et la réactivité de notre hôte, même si nous ne l’avons pas rencontrée. Ils n’étaient pas là et nous avons fait un self check-out qui s’est très bien déroulé. Petit bémol pour le quartier aux alentours du métro qui n’est pas très accueillant ainsi que pour le bruit à chaque utilisation de l’eau. Si vous êtes sensibles à la lumière le matin prenez des cache-yeux, car le soleil se lève très tôt et il y a beaucoup de lumière le matin."

En la parada del metro tiene varios supermercados cerca y un centro comercial."

C’est un endroit spacieux, propre et bien équipé et entretenu. 
Julia nous a envoyé les indications quelques jours avant et nous avons trouvé son appartement sans difficultés. 
L’appartement est à une quinzaine de minutes du métro à pied et il est proche des commerces. On peut rejoindre le centre ville facilement. 
Nous recommandons cette adresse."

Julia propose une documentation riche pour aiguiller les voyageurs.  Service de clé par boîte sécurisée très pratique. Logement bien équipé et bien décoré. Nous recommandons pour un voyage en famille. Avec deux jeunes enfants c’était parfait !"
6321,916806,261296966,2018-05-06,77973852,Daria,"Nous avons séjourné à deux, pendant quatre nuits, dans l'appartement de Julia. L'appartement est assez spacieux, bien équipé et très confortable. Le métro (à une dizaine de minutes à pieds) permet d'être dans le centre de Stockholm en une vingtaine de minutes. Ces quelques minutes de métro valent la peine puisque le cadre est particulièrement agréable si vous souhaitez un peu de calme et de nature. Le voisinage est très calme et agréable, et la vue est tout simplement sublime."
6322,916806,264941072,2018-05-15,35364341,Oleg,"The view is really wonderful. And the flat itself is cool too. It is compact and stylish, very clean and comfortable. Big thanks to Julia."
6323,916806,266657693,2018-05-20,77631476,Wendy,A lovely quiet apartment which was exactly as described. Very easy to get to from the subway and an easy journey into central Stockholm. Very close to beautiful walks and a lovely little beach. Very comfortable bed and so peaceful. The instructions were clear and easy to follow. Would definitely return.
6324,916806,268228687,2018-05-24,100070599,Amaury,Très bon séjour.  Apparemment bien adapté. A 10 mn à pied du métro... c'est idéal pour visiter Stockholm et être au calme le soir.
6325,916806,269953066,2018-05-28,5811991,Leon,"This is essentially a one-room flat, with a separate toilet. We were disappointed with the cleanliness and the facilities. The crockery and glassware needs to be replaced, as do the bed linen, pillows, and shower head (which leaks and sprays everywhere). The owner needs to purchase black-out blinds for the windows, because the sun streams in from about 4 am (in May). We were surprised that a cleaning fee was charged, even though there were areas of the room that were not clean. On the positive side, communication with the host was very good, and there is a sunny deck with a view onto a lake, making this a pleasant place to spend outdoor time (in the summer). Thank you for your efforts, Mansour and Julia; but you need to try harder to provide appropriate facilities for your occupants."
6326,916806,276524055,2018-06-14,169789895,Shekar,"Julias apartment is in a nice quiet residential area. We knew it was outside the city when we booked but it’s easily accessible by train and bus. The house was clean when we arrived and spacious enough for 4 people. There’s a washing machine available to use (no dryer). Julia was very helpful in giving suggestions about travel, sightseeing and directions to and from their apartment."
6327,916806,283218123,2018-06-29,129871068,Oliver,A really nice place to stay. You are in the city in less than 30 minutes and the beautiful nature is right in front of the house. It was a great trip. Everything was fine.
6328,916806,286033307,2018-07-05,174414995,Isabelle,"vue exceptionnelle sur la foret et le lac , grande terrasse , quartier cosmopolite , calme , à 30 mn du centre ville en métro qui est à 10 mn à pied   , logement  lumineux ( l’été) bien équipé et dans l'ensemble propre , salle de bain et douche  correctes "
6329,916806,288616028,2018-07-10,38242250,Jiyen,"We had a good stay at Julia’s place. She was  not there, but the detailed instructions were very clear and we had a trouble free stay and checkin - checkout experience. 
Good place for a short stay, not too far from the metro; however, if u travel with lot of luggage’s, recommend you take a cab or Uber as the house is on a hill. The view from the hill is just awesome !"
6330,916806,290810433,2018-07-15,156202385,Gabriela,"Our stay at Julia´s house was without any problems, we enjoyed it. "
6331,916806,298403611,2018-07-29,17853478,Helena,"This is a great flat in a beautiful and quiet suburb of Stockholm. The proximity of the beach is a plus. The view is lovely from Julia's garden. Although Julia wasn't there to welcome us the instructions for getting to the flat were meticulous and we had no trouble finding the place or getting in. Overall, a very happy stay in Skärholmen. "
6332,916806,303458070,2018-08-07,38574739,Khamees,"Julia’s apartment was the perfect base for our week stay in Stockholm.

As Julia has clearly stated, this is NOT a central Stockholm location - it was about 15 to 20 mins on the metro but this was ideal! Everything is close at hand. There was a shopping centre with a big supermarket located within a 5 minute walk of the apartment and it was lovely and quiet sitting out on the terrace at night, enjoying the views and a glass of wine.

The apartment has everything that you’ll need for a comfortable stay - we were able to cook for ourselves for a couple of nights and the washing machine was really handy too!

We would thoroughly recommend this apartment for a single traveller or a couple looking to explore the wonderful sights of Stockholm.

Thanks Julia!!"
6333,916806,305901190,2018-08-12,27946374,Anne,"Le logement de Julia est bien situé par rapport à Stockholm et à 15 min d une plage très agréable ,Julia répond aux
questions pendant le séjour "
6334,916806,307850341,2018-08-15,37250610,Raisa,"I had a great stay at the apartment of Julia and Mansour. It is conveniently located, close to the metro station and in a nice and quiet neigbourhood. The apartment itself was very clean and had everything you need for a short stay. I didn't speak to Julia and Mansour in person but they were always quick to reply to messages and checking in and out was very easy. "
6335,916806,312882890,2018-08-24,171253757,Rosa,"We had a really nice stay at Julia's place. It was exactly what we wanted. Close to the nature and not too far away from the city center (you'll have to count about 20 minutes with the subway + 10 minutes to get to the metro). The view is really nice and it's only 15-20 minutes walking distance from a wonderful beach. We also happened to meet a squirrel just in front of the house and a leveret and Bamby while walking in the woods (this made our little boy very happy).
The house has all you need and the washing machine is a plus. We didn't have the chance to meet Julia but she was easily reachable. We would definitely come back again. "
6336,916806,313861407,2018-08-26,199386491,Jyri,"The place is very nice! Has all the facilities that you need during your stay! The view is amazing! The metro station is about 15 min walking, and takes about 30 min to go to the center with the metro. So you must have the metro ticket! Me and my family enjoyed a lot! "
6337,916806,316397526,2018-08-31,9218382,Jenny,Description of facilities was accurate and distance from city not a problem as a very frequently train service. Lovely viwarm.  Unit a bit hard to find.
6338,916806,318111968,2018-09-03,7731818,Andreas,"Great location close to Stockholm, yet quiet with close facilities such as shopping centre, Lidl and beach! The apartment has everything needed for a couple or small family and the surrounding landscape is beautiful."
6339,916806,320211900,2018-09-08,53708941,Janet,"Good  base to explore Stockholm. As Julia says in her listing, the apartment is an easy 30minutes commute from Stockholm city centre. The apartment is located in a very peaceful suburb with good local supermarkets and shops in the local shopping mall. The stunning view of the lake is a bonus, however, this is not visible from the apartment itself but from the balcony of the apartment above. Nice walks around the area. Communication with Julia was very good."
6340,916806,322434597,2018-09-13,144439637,Marco,"Een mooi appartement voor 2 personen. Het is 1 grote ruimte. Hier rekening mee houden als je niet als stel reist, maar bijv 2 vrienden. Het huis ligt tegen een natuurreservaat, geweldig uitzicht vanaf zijkant huis. Je hebt beschikking over terras om lekker buiten te zitten. 
Stockholm centrum is goed te bereiken per metro. Metro en groot winkelcentrum op 10 min lopen. 
We hebben Julia niet ontmoet, ze werken met een sleutelkastje. 

Stockholm zeker een stad om terug te komen. Geweldige combinatie stad en natuur."

6342,916806,329537357,2018-09-29,160042343,Nelson & Heather,Julia's Place is good. We recommend to arrive before dark since it may be difficult to find the exact location. The place looks similar as in the pics. Julia responds to conversation quickly.
6343,916806,339261478,2018-10-21,50717867,Simone,"Basically the apartment is what the description says! 
However it was very humid in this apartment and smelled like a cellar. Also the water (shower) had a weird smell!
Self Check in and communication were super easy, the apt is well furnished!"
6344,916806,340298305,2018-10-23,219480179,Corine,bon rapport qualité prix. ligne de métro directe au centre ville. Près d'un parc calme et bord de mer. sympa.
6345,916806,341499671,2018-10-27,42615426,Mark,"Julia's place is right on a bus line and a short walk from the Metro station that goes to and from Stockholm.  There are also wonderful walking paths, some that lead right to the waters edge.  The view from the flat is spectacular.  I would love to see it in Summer,  but the fall colors were beautiful.  Julia provided very accurate and useful information for our entire stay, and we were pleased with the
 value we received.  Thank you Julia and Mansour!"
6346,916806,343614188,2018-11-01,78638844,Marta,El apartamento es tal cual se ve en las fotos. Esta muy bien comunicado del centro por metro y las vistas son estupendas. Un apartamento con encanto. Julia muy amable y comunicativa. Muy recomendable.
6347,916806,350410765,2018-11-19,195177064,Alexey,"Отдыхали в ноябре 2018 3 дня. Жильё приятно прадовало. Всё было даже лучше чем ожидалось. В квартире чисто, есть всё необходимое для комфортного проживания. Было очень тепло. Удобная мягкая кровать. Бесплатная парковка рядом с домом, что для Швеции большая редкость. Чистый воздух и живописный вид. Мы приехали поздно ночью, поэтому использовали self check-in. Юлия очень подробно расписала в сообщениях что и как делать. Когда у нас возникали вопросы или нужен был совет насчет достопримечательностей, Юлия оперативно(2-3 минуты) отвечала на сообщения и даже созванивались. В пешей доступности от жилья много супермаркетов с огромным выбором и адекватными ценами. Мы получили незабываемые впечатления от отдыха. Юлия, спасибо за гостеприимство!"

Die Stille ist sehr erholsam. Trotzdem sind die öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel gut zu Fuß zu erreichen.
Die Wohnung hat alles was für einen bequemen Aufenthalt nötig ist.
Die Gastgeberin ist über airbnb immer sofort  für alle anfallenden Fragen zu erreichen und  sehr entgegenkommend.
Wir haben uns dort sehr wohl gefühlt."
6353,916806,367117366,2019-01-04,67385672,Isabel,"Though we did not get to meet Julia in person (cause she was away on a trip), she was very informative and helpful with providing us the travel guides. Her place is located about 10-15mins walking distance from the train station. Do note that if you’re travelling with many baggage, it may be difficult to walk to her place as the route is mostly uphill - tough to walk especially with snow. Otherwise, it’s a cozy home "
6354,916806,400933860,2019-01-13,98946661,Amélie,"Un très belle hébergement avec une magnifique vue. Propre, fonctionnelle, rien a redire"
6355,916806,408689738,2019-02-05,47571977,Muriel,"Clean, spacious, with everything you need, Julia put the heat on, and the way from the street to our door was free of snow everyday thanks to Julia's husband so we felt safe.  Close by feet to everything, very easy to go to Stockholm (15min by metro).he sea and the woods are close and beautiful with all the snow. We warmly recommand it."
6356,916806,410532750,2019-02-10,65248132,Peter,"Clean and nice furnished, with great kitchen equipment, as well with comfortable bed. Walking distance to metro station and shops. Nice surroundings for walking in nature (lake with beach, forest). Great communication with Julia - fast responds to our questions. We really enjoyed our stay in Stockholm in Julia’s place."

Quelques bruits parasites de tuyauteries mais emplacement calme proche de la nature.
propreté impeccable"
6358,916806,413839735,2019-02-18,62287480,Elspeth,"Julia place is a great little studio in the Skärholmen suburb of Stockholm. The T-bana is about a 10minute walk away, making it so easy to get into the city, and the surroundings are beautiful at Skärgården. The place is a little smaller than it perhaps appears in the photos, but fine for a single traveller or a couple who are have the same sleep schedule. It’s not great if you’re a light sleeper - the water pump system is quite noisy, both the one in the studio and from the neighbours upstairs, so bring earplugs if you wake up easily!"
6359,916806,416206507,2019-02-24,50344711,Anna,"Perfect place! Very peaceful and green streets, not far from the city center (6 minutes to the metro station). We had a lot of questions about the city and Julia always helped us :) 5 stars, definitely!"

6361,916806,421379765,2019-03-09,135166949,Katja,Julia's place is like it is shown in the pictures. You have everything you need for your stay.The view is amazing and Julia gives you all the information you need. We were also a bit early and we hadn't any problem ro check  in earlier.  We would definitely reccomend it. Thank you.
6362,916806,423475715,2019-03-14,67058229,Stevo,"Lovely stylish place and in a great, quiet location. Despite this home being outside of Stockholm Central, the public transport system is excellent, a quick bus ride into Skärholmen and 20 minutes by Metro into Stockholm.  Skärholmen Central itself is bustling with shops and restaurants, so nothing is too far out of reach. Julia gave excellent instructions getting to the apartment, and checking in was easy. Bed was comfortable, and apartment well heated. My only recommendation would be to take 'nappy bags' as the toilet works on a pump system so no paper allowed in the toilet but to be placed in the bin. We preferred to use nappy bags for disposal out of personal preference to avoid any nasty smells. Would definitely recommend this property for a short stay, and it does have lovely views as well."
6363,916806,427741525,2019-03-24,206712204,Jana,Easy check- In. Beautiful view.

6365,916806,436975055,2019-04-14,4773057,Sigurdur Arni,A nice little apartment within walking distance of a mall and a metro station. My friends and I enjoyed our stay at this airbnb and I'm sure you will too.
6366,916806,439596252,2019-04-19,14219241,Frank,A small Sous-Terain-Appartement. We spent three days with 2 adults and 2 teenagers.  It was narrow but worked. There is water pump in the Appartement which disturbs in the night. The Appartement should be cleaned better. It wasn‘t really proper.
6367,916806,443099870,2019-04-25,41463589,Tang,"The house is quite large.
The price is reasonable.

6373,916806,475525639,2019-06-24,104472916,Holger,"The apartment is perfect for people traveling by car and/or enjoying a break in a calm surrounding after a trip to Stockholm city. You can reach the city by underground train within about half an hour with a short stroll to the next station. At the station there is a shopping mall with supermarkets and several shops.
The apartment is one large room plus bathroom. The large bed is situated in a nook so it almost gives the impression of a separate room. The kitchen is well equipped so you can cook your own meal if you like.
Taller people have to pay attention because a beam between the kitchen part and the living room is quite low. 
Although on ground level the apartment is quite bright. It has a huge deck with a small table and chairs where  - in summertime- you can enjoy your „fika“."

Сама квартира - небольшая (это кажется называется цокольный этаж). По поводу прекрасного вида  - как мы поняли, прекрасный вид у соседей, которые живут на втором этаже, а мы просто могли пройти к ним во дворик и понаслаждаться этим видом (главное не мешать соседям). Вид с дворика этой квартиры - это квартиры и дворики соседей напротив. Мы остались довольны данной квартирой."

La casa estaba muy bien acondicionada pero echamos en falta otro juego de sábanas, toallas y paño de cocina ( un único juego para una estancia de nueve días). 
La llegada fue muy fácil. Mandamos un par de mensajes nada más al llegar a Julia y en el mismo instante nos respondió. 
Fue unas vacaciones inolvidables."

The location is great with a lot of public transports (bus, subway), but also in a walking distance to the city center, shops for food around the corner and also nice small restaurants in the neighbourhood. Suzanne and Ollie are great hosts, meeting us even that our arrival was late. We warmly recommend their appartment."

If you are thinking about staying here - just do it!"

The apartment was spotless and the arrival and departure process was really easy. S+O responded very quickly to all our questions. I'd recommend this to anyone."

Failing that, public transport is only around the corner. Really spacious, stylish and comfortable. Top spot for our 3-day stay."
6403,944703,8265052,2013-10-22,6508123,Sevi,We had a great time in Stockholm! Despite the cold weather we enjoyed our stay very much. Christina was a very friendly host. I would absolutely recommend her nice appartement! The appartement is well located and you have only a two minute walk to the subway!
6404,944703,17788965,2014-08-17,13045820,Claudia,"We stayed for 6 days in Christinas apartment.
Christina was a nice and helpful host.
We really loved her apartment and recommand it from the bottom of our heart.
Especially the short distance to the underground (1  minute), was a reason
for choosing Christinas apartment.
Inspite of this fact it was really calm.
We really appreciate our stay and will choose it again.

6405,944703,18966868,2014-09-03,11598512,Anthony,L appart est tres bien entretenu. Nous avons dormi a 3 sans probleme. Christina est tres accueillante sans etre envahissante. Il n y a pas grand chose dans le quartier mais le metro est a 50 metres donc tres facile de se deplacer dans la ville.
6406,944703,19889574,2014-09-20,19475892,Robert,"This place is perfect! I didn't want to leave after staying only 6 nights at Christina's. The locations very convenient being around the corner from the train station and grocery store. Christina was very helpful as well, she waited for us to arrive even though we we're running behind. There were four of us and we felt very comfortable in her apartment after traveling 3 other countries. We'll definitely come back in the future."
6407,944703,43370337,2015-08-19,11649557,Michael,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Christina's apartment. It is very tastefully furnished and has all the amenities you wish for. The location is also very convenient only 2 minutes away from the underground station. Christina welcomed us personally and made sure that we found everything.
"
6408,944703,57437553,2015-12-26,31505601,Breiffni,Christina's apartment suited me perfectly. Ideally located and had everthing you could want. Christina was also a pleasure to deal with. Would definitely stay there if i returned to Stockholm.
6409,944703,84128927,2016-07-05,21139507,Janine,"We stayed at Christina's place for 3 nights with 3 people. It was a great stay! 

Christiana gave us a very warm welcome and was easy to approach and to communicate with in advance. Everything was well organized and prepared. 

The appartment is bright, fully equipped with everything we needed and clean. It has a nice and sunny balcony and Christina even provided a mattress for the third person. The bed was very comfy - it was hard to get up:). The neighborhood is residential, very quiet and the supermarket and metro just around the corner. It takes 15 minutes to the city centre, a metro ticket would be useful. 

Thanks Christiana for hosting us and all the best, Janine"
6410,944703,88837909,2016-07-25,64398588,Allyn,Christina is a very nice and happy person. I would recomend her anytime.
6411,944703,96972520,2016-08-25,42742368,Annika,"We had a great time at Christinas apartment. If you get into the flat you immediatly recognize the swedish character and charm of your host. Her balcony is really nice and we spent some beautifull hours there when the weather was good. Her neighbourhood is charming and very quiet. The next Tunnelbana Station (Hägerstensåsen) is only about one minute to walk, the transport to the old town  (Gamla Stan) and other places around there (Slussen, Mariatorget etc.) takes only 15 minutes. But you should know that there is no metro traffic at sunday night till monday morning at 4 o'clock. The way back home with a taxi costs about 200 SEK. When you stay for a longer period of time Christina makes some space for your personal belongings like food and clothes. Christina is a relaxed friendly and helpful character. If we come to Stockholm again she would be our first contact to ask for a bed ;) 

We wish you all the best,
Annika & David"
6412,944703,157651607,2017-06-04,35053108,Jelle,"My stay at Christina's place was one of the best Airbnb experiences thusfar! Great location, just 1 min walk away from the subway that takes you to the city in the blink of an eye. There!/ a beautiful lake nearby that offers an amazing view. I loved it:-)"
6413,944703,159424349,2017-06-11,1803690,Elisa,"Beautiful apartment with great light and lots of lovely house plants. It's not quite in the center of town, but very close to the T Bana, which is convenient. The trains pass often, so it's well situated. "
6414,944703,181829823,2017-08-13,22279086,Clare,"A lovely, cosy apartment really close to the metro, which takes you to the city centre easily. Christina was just going away for the weekend so all her things were at the house, but we still felt very welcome and able to make ourselves at home. Christina was great at keeping in touch and very flexible with check in and out times. Definitely recommend this place for a city break in Stockholm."
6415,944703,291592631,2018-07-16,31369867,Yaniv,"Christina accommodated an early check-in, and the apartment was in excellent condition. The location is especially convenient (minutes away from the train station and a grocery store). "
6416,944703,484045603,2019-07-08,137979265,Janet,"Clean, warm and friendly vibe, really close to Metro and supermarket. Host left fresh strawberries and fresh squeezed orange juice in fridge. The bed was so comfy!  Highly recommend!!"
6417,944703,493579364,2019-07-22,42803362,Samuel,The host canceled this reservation 23 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6418,944703,496305066,2019-07-27,125102375,Catrin,"As a welcome, Frida made us a blueberry pie and left us some ice cream, eggs and juice in the fridge, which was very nice (and tasty). Check-in was easy. The communication with both Frida and Christina was fast, helpful and uncomplicated.
Christinas apartment is very clean and bright, with all basic equipment you need. Although there is a construction area near the house right now, it was totally fine since we spent most of our days in the city. Generally, it was mostly silent at nights, even though
the apartment is close to a metro station (3 min walk). With the metro (at up to 10 min. intervals) you get to Stockholm city center in 15-20 min. The next supermarket we found was about 8 min away (walking distance), which was totally fine.
We really enjoyed our stay and recommend staying at Christina's place."
6419,944703,503038319,2019-08-05,176465498,Tara,"Christina and Frida were wonderful hosts and could not have have been more accommodating and communicative throughout.  Flight cancellations and delays meant that my arrival at the apartment became something of a moving target, but they made alternate arrangements so that my entry to the apartment late in the night after a long travel day was seamless.  The apartment was ideal - cozy, clean, well-equipped and in a great location.  The neighbourhood was very quiet and the station for the train into central Stockholm was only a few minutes' walk away.  There is a grocery store only 5 minutes away, and that was incredibly convenient, given the cost of eating out in Stockholm.  I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and am looking forward to booking again when I come back to Stockholm."
6420,944703,506049251,2019-08-10,219911349,Joao,"The apartment is lovely!
 It’s cozy and clean.   It is very spacious and bright. The kitchen has everything you need to  to cook, the bed is very comfortable! And the district around the house is quiet and green,  1 minute from the subway. Christina and Frida gave us an explicit instructions how to go to the apartment and about everything. He was staying in touch all the time during our stay, answering our questions, ready to help. With such kind of support we felt safe and quite confident in a foreign city! We loved Stockholm with all our hearts"
6421,944853,4004477,2013-04-02,5269453,Caro & Daniel,"We stayed at Henriks and Johannas apartment during our easter holidays and it was the best choice we could do. the apartment is beautiful, very clean and there is everything you need. on top of that Henrik and Johanna have a really great sense of style and we instantly felt very at home. They made it really easy to feel comfortable. Also the communication with Henrik was very easy (he is quick in wirting back, gave us really good descriptions of how to get there) and his friends gave us the key to the apartment and some really heplful tips!!! On top of that the flat is situated right in the centre of Södermalm and it is very easy to go everywhere walking (also the tube is 5 minutes away). 
If you ever has the chance to stay at Henriks apartment, go for it. We would recommend it a houndred times! "
6422,944853,4429232,2013-05-05,5210903,Miriam,"We really enjoyed our stay in Henriks apartment, it is so lovely and it's got everything you need for a great city trip: a very comfortable bed, a sweet nice kitchen (you're even allowed to use spice etc.) and it's situated in a very cool part of the city. We hardly ever used train or bus, everything is in walking distance. Henriks brother, who gave the keys to us, helped us out with some very helpful information. We even found a map and further information about wireless internet in the kitchen and fresh towels in the bedroom. Henrik really cares for his guests.There's no better choice for Stockholm, I think! We had a great time! Thanks for everything!"
6423,944853,4565450,2013-05-13,5371494,Bengt-Göte,"We were very happy about our stay in Henriks apartment! Friendly and nice host, everything worked out fine with good communication before our visit. To discover Stockholm and the southern parts it´s perfect. Nice neighbourhood, maybe a little noisy."
6424,944853,81168004,2016-06-21,38383064,Giuliana,Me and my friends had an amazing time in Stockholm. We staid at Henrik's and we couldn't have been happier. The flat is super central and we could reach everywhere walking. The flat is very nice and comfy. They gave us a few good recommendations as well. Definitely will come back!
6425,944853,90099603,2016-07-31,17188635,Mercè,"The apartment is really nice and beautiful, in the heart of Sodermalm and not far away from the old town. We had everything we needed, and Henrik was really caring about our comfort and wellness. We enjoyed a lot, 100% recommendable!"
6426,944853,173978189,2017-07-24,68267485,Juliane,"My parents and I had beautiful summer holidays in Stockholm. It was for sure the right decision to choose Henriks apartment. We found everything we needed, especially all necessary kitchen utensils, room furnitures and even a modern TV.  The flat is furnished in a very cozy way that you are feeling like home from the beginning. It is very tidy and offers enough space for three people. Furthermore we could use some of Henrik's and Johanna's spices and food. 
The flat is located very centrally close to Medborgarplatsen, with short walking distances to supermarkets, to the tunnelbana or to the old town. The only blemish, for those who are sensitive to noises, was the tumult at night.

6427,954832,4300579,2013-04-26,4046649,Oscar,Extremely nice and helpful. Very easy to deal with. Highly recommended.

We would definitely come back to him!"
6429,954832,4472010,2013-05-07,5206518,Melanie,"It was our first time in Stockholm and with airbnb and Mikael made us feel very welcome. He had lots of information to share with us about the city and things to see/do. He took good care of us during our stay, making sure we had everything we needed.
The studio in itself is clean, very bright and super comfy. There is plenty of space to feel at ease and everything you need. The small kitchen is perfect for breakfast or to dine in. The area is quiet.
Arriving from Arlanda airport with the bus, it is only a 10mn walk to the flat. There is a tube station right at the corner of the street that will take you to the city center in no time.

I strongly recommend Mikael's city studio to anyone, we had a lovely stay and Mikael was a great host !"
6430,954832,4593804,2013-05-14,1734840,Hendrik,"The beautiful weather, the lovely city of Stockholm but also our stay at Mikael’s studio made this a spring-trip to remember! The studio was very nice, clean, located in a quiet area with grocery stores around the corner. They really provided everything (towels as much as we wanted, shower gels, tooth-brushes, coffee caps, maps and information about Stockholm,…never seen that before). Mikael was very helpful, easy and fast to communicate with and he respected our privacy. This was our third Airbnb-experience, but the best so far. We really recommend this place, very good value for money! And for the fitness-addicts: there is a free fitness-room + sauna in the basement. Not that we had time for that, to busy having fika! :-)"

It was cenral....a few mintesaway from the metro, shopping etc. Very clean and had everything  I needed....good bedding, nice towels, place to play music and they booked laundry for me.  There is no TV, but it is not needed in this beautiful city. Mikael answered emails quickly and thougt of everything....even a SL card......thank you for everything.....I will recomend and return if I return to stockolm.  "
6432,954832,5160920,2013-06-16,6083884,Christina,"The stay at Mikael's place was great, the apartment was very neat and in a perfect location with everything close by! Mikael not only emailed us a pdf with all needed information but also marked maps of nearby places one can go for food, where to find transportation etc.  He was a wonderful host to my father and left a great impression on both of us. (My father was visiting me since I permanently moved to Sweden 1.5 years ago).  I would definitely reccomend this apartment to anyone visiting Stockholm.  Thank you again, Mikael! :)  "
6433,954832,5227277,2013-06-19,5401209,Marcelo,"Our luggage didn't arrive with us at Stockholm so to have Mikael's support was the best thing could happen to us. The studio was clean and comfortable, located in a really nice area with everything we need, easy access to subway and buses and with very nice walks in the neighborhood. We strongly recommend it for a perfect staying at this wonderful city.

"
6434,954832,5499935,2013-07-02,860876,Colleen,"Mikael is really lovely! He was very accommodating re our time of arrival, despite lots of changes from our end. The flat is in a good location and is perfectly nice. It is a tad on the small / cosy side though, perhaps more than we had realised when we booked for 3 people."
6435,954832,5707308,2013-07-13,5387750,Barbara,"It was our first time in Stockholm and the first time with airbnb. Mikael was a very friendly host, made us feel very welcome, answered all our questions and was helpful in any way! Despite a late arrival due to a canceled flight, Mikael was easily reachable - everything was very uncomplicated. The appartment is located in a nice and central area and there is very easy access to public transport. We primarily used buses, which get you quickly to interesting places - a nice way to get to know the city. We had a lovely time in Stockholm, especially thanks to Mikael and his trustworthy and uncomplicated hospitality.

6436,954832,6581784,2013-08-18,5669979,Georgie,"Mikael was a wonderful host we were first introduced as he immediately offered to take us around the area so we knew were to head out to!

The apartment is comfortable, extremely safe and in a great location close to vasastan and ostermalm. 

Across the road is a shopping centre with everything you need from food to international adapters, not to mention the metro access is through the shopping centre also!

I would highly recommend staying in Mikaels apartment it has all you need for a comfortable stay! "
6437,954832,6730491,2013-08-23,6921629,Clement,"Excellent location, 2 stops from centralstation and has a cheap supermarket nearby if you want to cook. Mikael was very attentive and his studio is equipped with everything you need. Mikael was very kind to lend me his washing machine for use. Even has a coffee machine for guests! "
6438,954832,7006486,2013-09-03,6331452,Franziska,"Stockholm, the apartment and the hosts are very lovely!! We enjoyed our stay with Mikael very much, he was always reachable by phone and very helpful with everything we needed!
The apartment is great, especially if you like to cook small meals because you don't want to or can't afford going out all the time.
The location is awesome as it very very central and also has great shopping possibilities. The one and only downside is the noise, which can keep you from sleeping. But it is definitely worth it :)"
6439,954832,7107696,2013-09-06,5608244,Candice,"This was my first time using AirBnB, and Mikael made it a great experience.  I highly recommend this place.

My friend Anna and I stayed for 3 nights after deciding to extend our stay in Stockholm.  We had started out at the Courtyard Marriott so had used the subway line and knew we liked the area before we booked.

About the place:  Very clean and has everything you'd really need - kitchen, k-cup coffee maker, Bose speaker/iPhone charger.  There isn't a TV - but we really didn't care about that, and the internet is fast enough to watch things on-line if you have a laptop w/you and we used the Bose speaker for better-than-laptop sound.  The couch pulls out into a full bed (which is where I slept) - and I slept really well.  A nice plus is that the bathroom floor is heated - which was awesome in the mornings.  

It's on a quiet street, but very close to the subway (Fridhemsplan).  There are plenty of bars, restaurants, a shopping mall, and a couple of grocery stores as well.

Mikael is very responsive, easy to reach, and helpful if you have any questions or requests.  We both had our own set of keys to use and code for the gate/building.  Our only request after check-in was for a hairdryer, and he responded within minutes and had one ready to go."
6440,954832,7226284,2013-09-11,4984695,Britta,"It was an absolutely pleasent stay at Mikaels appartment.He gives us a warm welcome and also a lot of information about the city and interessting things to discover. The appartment was also very nice, comfortable and very central. A lot of things can be reached by foot or also by T-bana (underground). So, we really really enjoyed the stay!"
6441,954832,7343938,2013-09-16,6209303,Tine,"The only thing I can say about this apartment and my experience is that it was wonderful! The place itself is fantastic, very modern, clean and fully equipped with everything you could possibly need. Perfect for two people, but also in three there shouldn't be any problem. We went everywhere by foot, a nice walk of about 10min to get to the centre of the city or 5min to the beautiful park with a small beach. Mikael and his wife are very gracious and wonderful people, they are helpful if you need something and are always available if you would like any suggestions in town. I strongly recommend to anyone who plans on visiting Stockholm to stop their search for a place to stay and book with these guys :)!"
6442,954832,7449220,2013-09-20,861908,Clarence,"Everything smooth and good. Flexible with checkin, tidy appartment with all you need in a good location and of course a very friendly host."

Mikael, was patient and kind enough for waiting our late flight and yet provided warm welcome, substantiation information and brochures for easy get around through Stockholm. The apartment was very cosy, clean and comfortable with lots of shops and bars around near by. Thank you Mikael."
6444,954832,7709869,2013-09-30,8682251,Xavier,"We've been is Mikael and Anna apartment for 4 days. We have received a lot of support, and explanations from them, and  we didn't find any point of dissatisfaction. Everything was clean, ordered and nice. The flat is clear, with a big window, and placed in a quiet building, very near of a metro station,  surrounded by cafes, shops and supermarkets. This an apartment very convenient and, for sure is on our agenda for any new staying in Stockholm. Thanks Mikael and Anna."
6445,954832,8921464,2013-11-25,2065832,Kay,"I am currently doing an internship in Stockholm and share an apartment with my team, which is mostly made up of men. I was getting burnt out and just needed a few days of quiet to myself (without guys around!), so I contacted Mikael. He was great at accommodating me at last minute. He responded to any questions and such extremely quickly through text, and I was left alone for the most part; which is what I wanted. The bed and the sofa is super comfortable and the floor heating on the bathroom was great!

I really enjoyed my stay and Mikael flexible check-in and check-out really worked to my advantage. Althought it might be a little pricier than other places in Stockholm, the location, the discreet service, and the awesomeness of Mikael really is worth it. 

One more thing I need to mention is that I needed to stay an extra night and Mikael got back to me right away on that and said it was okay for me to book an extra night through airbnb. I wish I was able to talk to him more, but well, that's not why I was staying there haha. "
6446,954832,9040986,2013-12-02,10188746,Francesca,"Mikael is a great host, willing and kind. He helped us out with transport, sightseeing and shopping, by giving us city maps, booklets  and a lot of tips. The apartment is clean and perfectly suitable for two people. Plus, there is a heated floor in the bathroom, which is very comfortable in winter. The area is full of shops, bakeries and supermarkets. The metro station is just 2 min walk while the bus stop to and from Arlanda airport is 8-10 min walk. That made my stay in Stockholm really convenient and pleasant. "
6447,954832,9608293,2014-01-03,10414062,Anders,"Me and my family stayed at Mikaels apartment over the new year. And it was all great, Mikael was a great host, helped us with a lot of information about the city, sigths and shopping.
The apartment had all it needed and worked very well for us - even with a 8 month old baby. "
6448,954832,10264587,2014-02-10,1399017,Saira,"Mikael was super helpful, providing me with tips of things to do, the local area and even using his oven! I was working non-stop so we didn't see each other much but I had everything I needed, and the apartment was super clean and done to high standards. Like being in a hotel! the bathroom was really nice, with heated floor tiles. 

I stayed for a month and would have stayed longer, but I needed a fuller kitchen - there is no oven, kettle, toaster etc. Mikael was happy for me to use his oven, but I was working long antisocial hours! 

The complex is safe with a key/pin access and there is a sauna, limited gym and big laundry room in the building!

Thanks Mikael for everything!"

Mikael was very friendly and organised, was waiting for me when I arrived (after delays with planes/motorway crash!) and easily accessible throughout the stay (although there were no problems I needed him for). The place was a good size, clean and had all things I needed including a coffee maker. I would definitely stay here again, and happily recommend it to anybody else considering staying here."

Mikael is a very nice guy who sent us in the forefront of our visit all information we needed to reach the apartment from the airport with the local transportation system. The apartment is comfortable and has everything you need to really feel at home during a stay. Mikael welcomed us and provided us with further information about the area for shopping, etc. There were also some useful information material and books about Stockholm in the apartment and we enjoyed reading a German book about Sweden which we found in the living room. 
You can contact Mikael for further information during the stay and he gave us some hints on restaurants nearby the apartment. The location of the apartment allows you to quickly reach every part of the city using the Metro station nearby. There are many shops and supermarkets nearby where you can buy anything you need for the stay. Even so, the apartment is located in a quiet and safe part of Stockholm.
Overall, we enjoyed our stay in Mikael's apartment very much and can really recommend it."

L'appartement est bien situé, fonctionnel mais petit , il faudrait préciser dans le descriptif la surface; une télévision serait un plus ! "
6455,954832,15460589,2014-07-09,16538043,Daniele,"The first experience with AIRBNB was perfect! Mikael is so kind and welcoming, he gives us some helpful information.

An incredibly helpful and friendly host who will go out of his way to help you. The accommodation was convieniently located in stockholm with 5-15minutes to all the major landmarks depending on method of transport.  Room was comforting to unwind at the end of the night.  Will be spend Stockholm again with Mikael.

6458,954832,16833644,2014-08-03,848523,Jamie,"Mikeal's place was the perfect home away from home. Great location, very clean and comfortable with easy access to public transit and groceries. Mikeal was very quick to respond to our request and questions and we really appreciated his excellent recommendations for things to see and places to eat in Stockholm. Highly recommended!"
6459,954832,17215625,2014-08-09,11940503,Laura,"Mikael was a great host, one of the best I have come across on AirBnB! Communication was brilliant and he was very accommodating when we arrived in Stockholm. He provided us with lots of useful information about the area we were staying and also things to do whilst we were in the city. The apartment is beautiful, quiet and really clean and tidy. Great facilities too, everything you would need for a short stay in Stockholm! He recommended places to eat and drink as well as providing us with maps and other information leaflets for us to take a look at. Perfect location as the nearest t-bana station is only two stops away from central station. I would definitely recommend staying here :)! x"
6460,954832,17601910,2014-08-14,3110242,Susana,"I had a very good impression og Mikael from the first moment! He answered my request and questions very promptly and meet us when we arrived and put himself to our disposition to explain about the apartment and area. The apartment was very bright and welcoming. The place is very central and with good access to transportation, even to take the shuttle bus to the airport. The bad was a bit o soft for me, but I'm used to a hard mattress! I can warmly recommend this nice place to stay some days exploring stockholm!"
6461,954832,18397577,2014-08-26,14496053,Sonia,"Mikael was a great host.  He spent time with my daughter and I when we first arrived, going through housekeeping issues, showing us how things worked, taking us through a map of Stockholm and suggesting what we could do. He was very welcoming and gave really clear instructions on how to find the apartment from the airport.  He even met us on the street to guide us in.  He provided my daughter with colouring pens and papers and a soft toy that she could take home, which she has called Princess.  The apartment was really clean and well organised and already had lots of essential things that we were able to use.  Very cosy just for two.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.  "

Mikael has everything perfect organized, plans how to get there, about the area around..... 5 Pages with informations.
He was very helpful and everything was very clean. We felt very comfortable. Thanks!!"
6463,954832,18834795,2014-09-01,18381337,Andrew,Staying here was wonderful! The apartment was super clean and tidy and the hosts were very welcoming and helpful in getting us situated for our visit with recommendations about things to see and do and how to navigate the local community. Our two year old daughter enjoyed being able to sleep in the bench-bed. The bed was very comfortable. The only slight downside was that laundry was downstairs and had the be scheduled to use. We probably could have handled that but we just had too much other stuff going on. :-)
6464,954832,24070279,2014-12-19,13866182,Iris,"I lived almost 3 months in Mikael' s appartment during the first period of my Sabbatical. Chosing this appartment was an excellent decision. Mikael is a very friendly, helpful and caring host and neighbour. The communication was very good, he had worthful advice and answered questions always promptly e.g.via sms. The appartment is clean,cosy and equipped with a lot of useful things. It has easy access to puplic transportation and shops. I have already recommended it to friends! Tack så mycket! "
6465,954832,24929391,2015-01-04,22759804,Helena,"Wir waren zu zweit über Silvester in Mikaels kleiner Wohnung. Die Wohnung war schön und sehr sauber; auch die Ausstattung war super (Kaffeemaschine, Föhn, Pürierstab, Regenschirme, Bügeleisen, Mikrowelle…). Das Bad war ziemlich neu und schick (Fußbodenheizung!). Die Lage der Wohnung ist auch gut; in einer halben Stunde erreicht man zu Fuß Stockholms Altstadt; Supermarkt, Bahn, Einkaufszentrum waren im 3min-Radius. Relativ leise und wirklich warm war die Wohnung auch. Die Sauna im Keller war groß und stand nach vorheriger Anmeldung uns allein zur Verfügung. 
Mikael ist ein absoluter Engel! Wir konnten ihn alles fragen und er hat uns immer geholfen. Er hat uns viele Broschüren über Stockholms Attraktionen zur Verfügung gestellt, im Voraus für uns einen Tisch im Restaurant reserviert und uns 8 Seiten Infos (Anfahrt zur Wohnung vom Flughafen, nähere Umgebung der Wohnung usw.) über Stockholm und die Wohnung per Mail geschickt - und das noch vor der Reise. Während unseres Aufenthaltes durften wir ihm immer eine kurze SMS schreiben, wenn wir Fragen hatten und er hat immer innerhalb von ein paar Minuten geantwortet. Mikael wohnt direkt nebenan und war so immer schnell zur Stelle. 
Es gab wirklich absolut nichts Negatives. Wir haben uns wirklich sehr wohl gefühlt - wie zuhause! Bei Reisen nach Stockholm wird es zukünftig immer in diese Wohnung gehen :)
Vielen Dank, Mikael!"

He made a lot of useful kitchenaids available for us, so we did not need to bring a lot of stuff with us on the trip. We were in Stockholm for 8 days with our little baby (7 month old) and the apartment was perfect for our needs. There was a little bed for our boy to sleep in, which worked well. We were very happy with the apartment, Mikael as a host and Stockholm, so we hope to visit again when the wheather is warmer and we will definitely recomment this appartment!!"

The apartment is very nice, clean and very warm!  I was worried about this beforehand as it was winter, snowing and about -4 degrees outside.  It is also very quiet and I felt safe walking from there to Stockholm Waterfront conference centre daily at 6.30am.  It is close to shops, transport, the coach stop to the airport and a supermarket.  A very nice place  to stay and it's a shame I couldn't stay for longer.  The centre of Stockholm is quite small, so is easy to walk round and I managed to fit in a visit to Gamla Stan and the fabulous Abba museum too as well as 3 days work.  Thank you to my hosts."
6468,954832,26687113,2015-02-17,485776,Kaylin,"Staying at Mikael's apartment in Stockholm was a wonderful experience. We couldn't have been in a better neighborhood - it was quiet and easy to get around. The apartment itself was very cozy, clean, and just the right place for our 10 day stay. Mikeal was a perfect host - helpful and open, greeted and showed us around the apartment, even taking time to look over a map of Stockholm with us and give recommendations. I highly recommend you stay here, another wonderful AirBnB experience. Thanks Mikael! "

Discrets,  ils sont restés toujours disponibles pour nous informer ou nous communiquer des adresses pour agrémenter notre séjour. 
L'appartement était parfait pour notre séjour. Il est équipé de l' essentiel, situé dans un quartier calme, à proximité des magasins. De plus son implantation proche du métro et centre ville favorise la visite de cette belle ville de Stockholm.
Nous sommes très favorables à le recommander à nos amis."

Il répond toujours très rapidement, que ce soit pour réserver ou pour demander un renseignement lors du séjour. L'appartement est bien situé: vous avez deux supermarchés à côté avec d'autres commerces et une station de métro, et pourtant il est dans un petit coin calme avec un accès bien sécurisé (bien qu'à Stockholm il n'y a pas trop de souci à se faire) ! 
L'appartement est également bien équipé, conforme aux photos, la cuisine et la salle de bains marchent bien et sont en très bon état. Bon point pour le lit qui est très confortable car bien moelleux :) 
Je recommande sans hésiter ;)

Mikael is a great and very kind host! Apartment functional, very comfortable bed, good location, supermarket and underground station nearby. Recommanded! :)"

He also provided great local recommendations and spent considerable time explaining the apartment facilities when we arrived. When he was gone overnight once, he sent a message describing where to find an extra blanket in case the weather turned cooler. A top-notch host! Apartment was well located, appointed and supplied. There was a private courtyard where you can read quietly, have a picnic, or just relax. Plenty of room for two and far superior to a hotel stay. Great public transportation to and from apartment."

Mikael hat schon im Vorfeld sehr freundlich geschrieben und uns mit allen nötigen Informationen versorgt, so dass wir uns sehr willkommen gefühlt haben. Dieser Eindruck hat sich auch während unseres Urlaubes bestätigt,
die Wohnung war sehr sauber und gemütlich und nur drei U-Bahnhaltestellen vom Zentrum entfernt, trotzdem weit genug, dass man auch mal dem grössten Trubel entfliehen konnte. Gute Einkaufsmöglichkeiten und eine sehr gute Pizzeria gleich um die Ecke.
Ein rundum gelungener Urlaub, vielen Dank nochmal an Mikael, wir können die Unterkunft nur weiterempfehlen."

6481,954832,46338367,2015-09-09,23311395,Isola,Prima esperienza con airbnb. Direi proprio positiva. Mikael ci aspettava in strada  all'ora a cui avevamo detto che saremmo arrivati (11.30). Ci ha fatto trovare cartine e dato informazioni utili per il soggiorno. Ha sempre risposto prontamente ai nostri messaggi e si è sempre reso disponibile. L'appartamento  era  pulito  e come descritto. Molto gradite le cialdine per il caffè espresso. La posizione ottima. Siamo stati veramente bene. Grazie  
6482,954832,46919502,2015-09-14,5664806,Miriam,"My husband and I had one of the best experiences on AirBnB by staying at Mikael's. The apartment was cozy and had everything we needed. It even had things you normally forget to bring (umbrellas, outlet adapters, maps, etc). The place was about a 30min walk from the city center which I loved. It was nice to feel as if I actually lived in Stockholm but know I could get to the center easily. 

The apartment was very easy to get to from the airport and had many transportation options nearby, which we didn't need since it was so easy to get around by walking, and Mikael showed up some walking routes that were simply gorgeous. The surrounding area had goods places to eat, drink, sip some coffee and a great supermarket.

Mikael himself was a truly amazing host. He made us feel as if we were visiting a friend or relative. He was always available if we needed him and responded to texts/emails quickly. He also gave us great recommendations on where to eat and drink.  I cannot say enough nice things about both Mikael and the place. My only disappointment was having to leave!"

The unit, though very compact, was well laid out, comfortable and well maintained. The location was excellent and readily accessible by foot and nearby public transportation to all major attraction in Stockholm."

We had no trouble finding his apartment. He also introduced us to the suburb and Stockholm and gave tips on how we could spend our time there. 
The apartment is exactly like the pictures on the listing, very homely and clean. All essentials were there in the apartment. 
The suburb is excellent with lots of restaurants and shops around. 
Overall we had a lovely time in Stockholm. "

El apartamento estaba impecable y dispone de todo lo que puedas necesitar para tu estancia. Está muy bien situado y comunicado, el barrio es tranquilo y dispone de todos los servicios. Y Mikael es genial, a parte de la información recibida antes de viajar, nos estaba esperando en la puerta del edificio cuando llegamos. Después de mostrarnos el apartamento nos enseñó el vecindario, indicándonos donde comprar o comer y nos dio consejos útiles para visitar la ciudad. ¿Que más se puede pedir?"

Nous avons particulièrement apprécié l'accueil et la disponibilité de Mikaël, qui a largement contribué à la réussite de notre séjour.
Dès la réservation, nous avons reçu un descriptif sur l'appartement et le quartier. Lors de notre arrivée, Mikaël nous attendait pour nous présenter l'appartement et pour répondre à toutes nos questions. 
Pendant le séjour, il restait toujours disponible (mail, sms).
Je recommande vivement!!"

The apartment was absolutely spotless and very well kept.  Communication with Mikael was very easy and he went out of his way to ensure my stay at his apartment went as smoothly as possible.
6497,954832,73998590,2016-05-12,5062539,Abhay,"Mikael is an excellent host. Very friendly and accommodating of our requests. The flat is in a great neighbourhood too. We walked to it from central station but the metro (t-bana) is just 2 minutes away. 

The flat had everything we needed for a vacation/business trip. The shops are just around the corner too. We appreciate the little touches like the espresso machine, lots of information leaflets and fast broadband.

This place is definitely on the top of our list if we use AirBnB in Stockholm again."

6499,954832,75077048,2016-05-18,19751467,Jennifer,"From our very first inquiry, Mikael was most a welcoming Host & at all times a very prompt, responsive & helpful communicator.   The apartment description & photos were exactly as represented on the 'airbnb' website. A spotlessly clean, quiet, cosy, well maintained, well lit, bright & airy apartment with all necessary facilities for an extremely comfortable & enjoyable stay.  The apartment is located in a lovely neighbourhood (Kungsholmen) & so close to shops, supermarkets, post office, transport, restaurants etc. + central Stockholm. It is less than 5 minutes walk to the nearest Metro/Tunnelbarna stop (Fridhemsplan) & this stop was only 2 stops from 'Stockholm Central'.  Several bus routes also in close proximity. The apartment is set in an apartment block that was extremely quiet & secure -  the communal areas (i.e. stairs/lift/lobby entrance etc.) were very clean & well maintained also, including the large private, inviting courtyard area for residents.  Entry security excellent both to the apartment  & the apartment block.  Michael lives in the adjacent apartment & is therefore promptly available should anything be required etc. (which in our case, wasn't). The bath towels Mikael provided were the best we've experienced in any 'airbnb' establishment so far...water pressure both in the kitchen & bathroom was really good with immediate & abundant hot water.  Overall lighting throughout the apartment also very good indeed + heating very effective & cosy.  The 'gallery' kitchen was small but well equiped & functional for basic meals - bed very comfortable & great internet. My husband & I were very impressed that the apartment also contained 'safety' items  being a First Aid Kit / Fire Extinguisher / Fire Blanket.  Mikael also supplied a wealth of local sight-seeing pamphlets/brochures/maps etc. & an extremely helpful 'Welcome Package' Folder containing  detailed information relating to the apartment that Mikael also emailed to us well prior to our arrival - this was much appreciated.  Michael is indeed a great Host - we would not consider staying anywhere else on a return visit to Stockholm & would highly recommend to friends/family."

The place is very clean, very well located and Mikael is the best host. He remembered that my husband liked IPA's and filled the fridge with some! The communication with Mikael is always great and he has great recommendations for places to eat. His place is definitely a must if you're visiting Stockholm!"

6502,954832,77284523,2016-05-31,72495916,Chloe,Mikael was a warm/friendly host. He was also very responsive; we received answers and replies for all our inquiries before and also during our stay. He came to the bus stop to pick us up and explained the areas around and also about the flat kindly with cares. The flat was clean and cozy. It was exactly as same as the pictures uploaded and a bit bigger than our expectation (we were 3 girls). The location was good to access to the city center and other tourist attractions. We walked and managed to visit most of the places we planned. The area was nice and safe as well. Highly recommended. Thanks Mikael for your warm hospitality. 
6503,954832,78179987,2016-06-05,50473490,JAMES (Jim) & Carol,"Mikael was extraordinair from the time we made the reservation. His detailed information and service was outstanding. This AirBnB is very close to stores and public transportation. The accommodations were very good with much needed washing facilities
When the weather is warm and need for cooler air you need the door open, the street noise at night is very load. This is the only negative and the only reason for not giving a higher rating.
Ear plugs or a small fan can resolve this situation. 
Mikael said that he would get a small fan."
6504,954832,79833157,2016-06-14,56769601,Jessie,"This was the perfect stay for us in Stockholm. The apartment is exactly as it presents on the AirBnB website which is so lovely to see. It is the cleanest apartment we have ever stayed in and there was not a thing out of place! Mikael was a lovely host who ensured we had everything we needed and even though he was out of town for the majority of time we were there he was easily contactable by email and phone which was a great reassurance. He was there to greet us when we arrived and discussed all the best places to visit and this welcome made settling in easy and made it feel like coming home. The only thing missing when there were eggs cups, but everything else about the kitchen was very simple to use and although it looks small there is in fact just the right amount of room to do everything you need. 

Thanks so much Mikael for providing an amazing home. We can't wait to return!"
6505,954832,82462144,2016-06-27,57459364,June,We stayed at Mikael's place for 9 days. Mikael was welcoming and helpful! The apartment was clean & bright. The location was very convenient to explore Stockholm & the surrounding area. Excellent host!

Mikael was incredibly responsive and helpful even before our trip as we had some questions in advance of our trip about restaurants and other things. He also had recommendations for spas as I contacted him at the mid point of our two week trip while we were in Oslo and needed a massage. :) 

The location was great because it was in a quiet area away from the tourists and super close to public transit which made it very easy to get anywhere in the city. 

The little kitchen was perfect for us as we hit the grocery store as soon as we arrived so that we could make breakfasts and have snacks and night caps. 

The bed was comfy and we had everything we needed to make it our Stockholm home away from home for a week. 

Thanks for everything, Mikael! It was a pleasure meeting you!"

6510,954832,91056037,2016-08-03,37047874,Carolina,"We had an amazing time at Mikael's apartment, probably the best with air bnb!! The apartment is so beautiful: clean, bright and it has everything you need from the shampoo to the coffee machine!! Also it's in a very good location: central but very quiet at night! The metro station is less than 5 minutes walking, so brilliant! And last but not least Mikael was incredibly kind, responsive, reliable, very helpful, he waited for us even though we took a late flight and showed his flat and gave us lots of tips and information about Stockholm!! He also was very flexible about our leaving time since we had a late flight, he kindly let us leave our suitcases in his home so we could go to visit Stockholm even on our last day and then take them back when we wanted!!
So he made our stay the best trip ever! We will certainly come back to Stockholm and with no doubts we are going to stay in this wonderful flat!!"
6511,954832,92006797,2016-08-07,17367188,Edith,"Mikael ist ausserordentlich freundlich und hat sich sowohl im Vorfeld als auch während des Aufenthalts oft gemeldet. Er ist engagiert und wirklich bemüht, hat uns mit Infomaterial ausgestattet und war jederzeit für Fragen verfügbar.. Die Wohnung selbst ist wirklich sehr sauber, die Betten und die Handtücher, aber auch jeder Schrank war sauber und gepflegt. Alles wirklich in bester Ordnung und das macht viel vom Wohlfühlgefühl aus. Es ist alles da, was man braucht und auch die geringe Wohnfläche stört kein bisschen. Im Haus selbst ist es leise, Nachbarn haben wir weder gehört noch gesehen, es scheint ein netter Ort zu sein. Die Lage ist sehr ok, wir konnten abends gut zu Fuss aus dem Zentrum zur Wohnung laufen und würden dafür eher die Kungs(holm)gatan empfehlen als die Fleminggatan. Kungsholmen liegt auch direkt am Wasser - ebenfalls ein schöner Weg. 
Stockholm selbst ist eine wunderschöne Stadt und eine weitere Reise wert. Wenn, dann auch gerne wieder in Mikaels Studio!"
6512,954832,94081092,2016-08-14,58589898,Davide,"Appartamento molto pulito con tutto il necessario. A circa 200 metri si trovano una fermata della metropolitana, due supermarket, ristoranti. Si può andare piacevolmente a piedi alla Stazione Centrale in circa 20 minuti. Mikael e Anna-Karin sono molto gentili, disponibili ad ogni richiesta e sempre in contatto con noi dall'inizio alla fine del soggiorno."
6513,954832,95084896,2016-08-18,53960215,Tracy,Outstanding host ; Sami did everything to make our stay as good as possible.  Fantastic communication before and during our stay!
6514,954832,97002330,2016-08-25,77554397,Cayan,The apartment is nice and comfortable. Mikael is a superb host and always available to help when needed.  It was my first time using airbnb and he made my choice to use it again simple. Absolutely. 2 thumbs up!!
6515,954832,98082680,2016-08-29,25625407,Prashanth,Mikael is a wonderful host. Both his wife and he have paid great attention to detail in the setup of the apartment. Everything necessary is easily available. He is very responsive to questions. I would surely stay here when I come to Stockholm again. Take a walk from the apartment to the City Hall. It is perhaps one of the best things we did. Amazing views. The apartment is very well connected to the other islands and airport but still feels private. 
6516,954832,99439832,2016-09-04,1848137,Marcella,"We had a wonderful time at Mikael's apartment. It is cosy, bright and clean and has everything you need, such as coffee for the coffee machine or a nice smelling shampoo. The location is perfect, central but very quiet at night. Mikael was a wonderful host. He waited for us outside the flat and gave us lots of tips about Stockholm. We also brought our 7 month old daughter and that was not a problem at all. Mikael provided a cot and she slept through all the nights we stayed!! In case we come back to Stockholm we would certainly stay with him again and thus can fully recommend this apartment!"
6517,954832,151346444,2017-05-12,20032684,Michelle,Mikael was so great in helping us get settled.  Answered our numerous questions and if he didn't know the answer he looked it up for us. His place was completely spotless and organized and we had everything we needed even coffee in the morning. His communication was amazing and we never felt we were far from somebody that could help. The subway was less than two blocks away as was a very large grocery store.  The breakfast shop was across the street and at least three restaurants within one block. We will definitely come back to his place.  
6518,954832,153965749,2017-05-22,55054445,Ana Maria,"Michael´s place is absolutely fantastic, very well located, quiet, full with nice details and he and his wife are kind are helpful when needed. I spent an unforgettable week in Stockholm and part of it was staying in this amazing place, I totally recommend it."

Mikael was a friendly host and always replied promptly to any of my questions. I also like the district full of bars and nice restaurants. We would definitely come back here if we visit Stockholm again!
Thanks a lot Mikael for your hospitality!"

Hairdryer, iron and board, books, great wifi, umbrellas, lovely kitchen .... everything!! A wonderful location close to public transport and great cafes, restaurants and attractions. We spent an exceptionally comfortable 5 nights in this wonderful accommodation. Extremely highly recommended."
6525,954832,167036036,2017-07-05,60623745,Turner,"Would highly recommend Mikael's place. He was a very helpful and kind host with great communication. The apartment was spacious and had everything we needed. The kitchen area is not huge, as explained in the posting, but we did not cook so it didn't bother us. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was also very nice. The location was great. There are lots of great restaurants and cafes just a couple minutes walk from the apartment. It was about a 20 minute walk to the city center, with a lot of restaurants and shops along the way. The road is quite busy, so it is a little loud at night, but it is okay if you close the door. Mikael was also very helpful with reserving us a time slot to do laundry at the last minute and we really appreciated it! He also provided detergent. Very full service :) Overall, the listing is as shown and is very clean and comfortable in an excellent location."
6526,954832,167509078,2017-07-07,58892960,Kai,"Wir hatten einen sehr schönen Aufenthalt bei Mikael. Er ist ein sehr zuvorkommender und hilfsbereiter Gastgeber und hat uns sehr herzlich empfangen. Die Lage der Wohnung ist absolut einmalig, man ist direkt an der U-Bahn und sogar direkt zu Fuss nach ein wenig Laufzeit in der Innenstadt. 

Es ist die perfekte Wohnung für einen schönen Trip nach Stockholm, die Austattung ist absolut ausreichend und man findet alles Nützliche! Wir hatten wunderschöne Tage und ich kann die Wohnung absolut empfehlen! Beim nächsten Mal kommen wir wieder :)"
6527,954832,169300990,2017-07-12,74427807,Egoitz,"Nuestra estancia en el apartamento de Mikael fue genial. Él fue muy hospitalario, nos recibió allí y nos dio indicaciones relativas a la ciudad y al barrio. Viajamos con un bebé y dispusimos de cuna.
El apartamento es muy acogedor y dispone de todo lo necesario. 
Todo perfecto, para repetir!! "
6528,954832,172786228,2017-07-22,94088088,Mary,"We thought Mikael's place was in a great location. We were able to walk anywhere in the city but the coffee places, restaurants and cafes down by the water were wonderful and away from the majority of the tourists. Mikael gave us many good suggestions for places to see and restaurants to go to. The apt. Is perfect for two people and it was very clean and we had everything we needed. He also supplies a pamphlet with a lot of useful information."
6529,954832,177212347,2017-08-02,20809471,Joao Antonio,"My wife and I stayed 8 days in this very nice, super clean apartment.
The wifi works perfectly and real fast.
The location is very convenient, in a nice neighbourhood, with a lot of upermarkts around and easy access by bus or T-banna (Metro) from/to central train / bus stations.
As a bonus there is a gym with the basics for a workout.
The host is very nice and made us fell very welcomed, answered all our questions almost emitiatly.
We sure would stay here again and I recommend this apartment to all our family and friends."
6530,954832,179999103,2017-08-09,34686119,Stanislav,"The studio was lovely and best pick for pir family. Ot allowed us to explore Stockholm as we enjoyed riverside walking with kids. The interior was clean with a number of modern convenient appliances (like a shower). Mikael greeted us and advices us about a few awesome spots to fit our needs. Even we were a family of four, we had no issues with fitting in in that cozy space."
6531,954832,181615015,2017-08-13,67963810,Sébastien,"Appart plutôt bien situé, sur une île de la ville très agréable et proche du centre.

6532,954832,185186530,2017-08-21,3969797,Heather,"Fabulous apartment, fresh clean, well laid out with everything you need for  your stay in Stockholm.  Mikael very welcoming and friendly with lots of local knowledge to pass on.  Great location, close to bus & metro links.  Casual bar down stairs great for a revival beverage after a day of exploring beautiful stockholm."
6533,954832,188466701,2017-08-29,44019822,Paul,"We had a great visit to Stockholm and Mikael ' s apartment was the perfect refuge.  Located away from the tourist areas, yet only 2 blocks front the underground metro that apartment was in an ideal location.  The Airbnb photos do not do the apartment justice.  The space is ample and spotless.  The bed is comfortable and the bathroom is modern.  The kitchenette does the job and the apartment contains every element to make a visit enjoyable ranging from a loner umbrella to extra power plugs.  Mikael greeted us upon arrival, offered a thorough orientation to the city, and gave spot on recommendations for sightseeing and eating.  I cannot imagine a better place to stay while visiting this beautiful city."
6534,954832,191059378,2017-09-06,26025784,Kate,"We really enjoyed our stay at Mikael's place. It was bigger than expected, plenty of room for 2 adults & a 2 year old (after a little toddler proofing). Mikael was a fantastic host - very clear communication and able to help with lots of things from providing maps & brochures to collecting mail. He even had a teddy bear and cars waiting for our son! The place is very warm inside so no need for heavy pjs. The location is fantastic - just a short walk to the metro and local shopping/eating. Highly recommend a stay here."
6535,954832,201927151,2017-10-09,922667,Stephanie,"Mikael's place is in a great location: there's easy access to public transportation, including to and from the airport, and there are plenty of restaurants nearby. There is ample space for two people, everything is clean, and Mikael has very thoughtfully stocked his place with helpful items for travelers, such as umbrellas, coffee, maps, and an adapter."

6537,954832,204049897,2017-10-16,99641215,Andreas,"We stayed in the flat for a long weekend in Stockholm and we loved it.
It had everything we needed and Mikael was always ready to give us advice about Stockholm. Moreover, it is located very central and close to the train. Although our first flight was delayed until late into the night and our flight back was only in the evening, this didn't cause us a lot of trouble, since Mikael was very flexible about check in and check out times. Thank you Mikael for a wonderful stay!"
6538,954832,206226081,2017-10-24,150009549,Sarah,"Brilliant location, outstanding host and honestly a wonderful apartment. Mikael could not be more helpful and the apartment is brilliant. Will be recommending to anyone for a stay in Stockholm. Thank you!"
6539,954832,209815774,2017-11-06,69290998,Jill,This place is great!  Mikael gave me tons of ideas for things to do and places to go - I only did a fraction of them.  It just means that I will have to come back again and stay at Mikael’s place.  He had many brochures of interesting places I didn’t think to go see.  The apartment itself was spotless.  The bed was very comfortable and I slept like a baby.  I would highly recommend this location.
6540,954832,211510099,2017-11-13,31286300,Stephanie,"Wir haben ein Wochenende in Mikaels Wohnung verbracht und können die Unterkunft wärmstens empfehlen. Die Wohnung ist leicht zu erreichen, super ausgestattet und es gibt Einkaufsmöglichkeiten in der Nähe. Mikael antwortet sehr schnell, gibt gerne Sightseeing-Tipps und war ein vorbildlicher Gastgeber."
6541,954832,231869860,2018-02-03,4821850,Clay & Michelle,"Mikael was a great host. Very good communication, gave good information before I even had to ask for it, and was very responsive to any requests.

Hope to visit again, if we find ourselves in Stockholm in the future. Tak, Mikael!"

Plenty of room, very well maintained, and only a short walk across the bridge into Vasastan. A metro stop and supermarket was only one block away. Mikael provided a travel card on arrival – very thoughtful – as well as coffee pods and a tour of the building. Thanks again!"
6545,954832,245636479,2018-03-23,16966671,Gelare,Mikeal’s place was one of the best airbnb I have ever been to. He is a super host!
6546,954832,247322662,2018-03-28,15819098,Hadi,"Mikael’s place is clean, spacious for a studio apartment, great value and also in a really nice and quiet location in Stockholm.  It is not too far from main attractions / transport in the city. There are also nice restaurants and cafes around the area. 

Mikael was also an excellent host and was always quick and available to communicate. We even had two delayed flights and arrived much later than we had planned. He stayed up for us and made sure we got in safely. I would most definitely stay here again in Stockholm, but you do need to walk or take a bus to get closer to the city center if that is what you are expecting."
6547,954832,252859708,2018-04-12,35588719,Nick,"Mikael's flat is a nice studio walking distance to restaurants, the water, and subway. He was very attentive and went out of his way to help me out during my visit. Recommend staying with Mikael!"

In our opinion, there's not a single thing that can be improved. Would book again, hands down. Highly recommended!"
6550,954832,261806407,2018-05-07,8928481,Claustre,"L'estudi és petitó, però suficient per a parella i bebè. No és molt a prop del centre , però tens busos i el metro allà mateix. O si no,amb una caminadeta d'uns 40 minuts per la vora de l'aigua (molt bonic) també hi arribes.
Hospitalitat excel·lent. Hi tornaríem sens dubte."

Nous recommandons ce logement."

This was my first time in Stockholm and Mikael was really nice and helpful in welcoming me and explaining everything.  I felt comfortable right away.  The location is great.  I bought a 30-day pass for the metro and used it every day to quickly get around town, whenever I didn't want to walk.  

Everything worked great and was very clean and high-standard.   Communication with Mikael was always great.  Did not want to leave Stockholm.  Thanks Mikael!   "

6554,954832,279973536,2018-06-22,85074709,Marika,"Mikael was very hospitable with us. He was waiting for us outside the building. He explained us all the rules in the apartment and he answered to alla my question about the city, transport, museums....He was very kind and offered his help also for the day after the check in.
The apartment is not so big, but it has all the things you need, and we were I, my husband and my daughter that is one year old.
Also the position is perfect:  minutes from the train station and the city center. There is also a bus stop and a metro station at 100 metres from the building and a lot of supermarkets and restaurants, so eating was not a problem!
I would like to thank Mikael very much!"

The apartment is new and clean, walking distance to the train, and Mikael is an amazing host. He is helpful and responsive while allowing you to enjoy your privacy. The neighborhood is great, too. Good restaurants and shopping nearby. Can't say enough good things. We had a superlative trip to Stockholm. Thanks, Mikael!"

Mikael was very prompt with questions, and was easy to get a hold of. He also provided great suggestions on what to do/where to eat, etc. We were only able to stay one night, and wished we could have stayed longer. I would not hesitate to stay there again. "
6558,954832,295851777,2018-07-24,39397174,Mandy,"Mikael was quick to respond, waited outside the apartment building for us to arrive late at night, gave us a good explanation on the apartment, the area & Stockholm in general. We appreciated him booking us a slot to use the building’s laundry facilities. The scrupulously clean, uncluttered apartment was well set out with everything we needed for our stay with good supermarkets, shops & metro station close by. There was some road noise which we could not hear when the windows were closed. Mikael thoughtfully provided a pedestal fan as Stockholm experiencing very warm weather. Honestly the best Airbnb we’ve stayed in & can’t recommend highly enough for a couple looking for a studio apartment. Well deserves ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
6559,954832,299660636,2018-07-31,106775196,Elisabeth,"Appartement très bien situé. Il est fonctionnel et lumineux. 
Nous avons apprécié l'accueil et la gentillesse de Mikael qui s'est montré arrangeant . Nous avions toutes les informations nécessaires pour passer un excellent séjour. 
(à noter cependant que l'appartement ne dispose pas de doubles rideaux  ce qui peut être gênant en été car le soleil se couche très tard et se lève tôt.). 
Rien à dire de plus. Nous recommandons cette appartement.

The area and building are quiet and felt safe, and there were several good restaurants, bakeries, and grocery stores nearby.  The kitchen is small and best for simple meals but it has all the basics. He was always quick to respond, and had lots of information on things to do in Stockholm. The laundry facilities in the basement were great too.   I really enjoyed my stay in Mikael's flat and would definitely go back again."

Mikael è un oste eccezionale, gentile e disponibile : al nostro arrivo ci ha dato una piccola spiegazione dei luoghi da visitare e ci ha consigliato alcuni posti dove mangiare e far compere. Inoltre, si è reso disponibile per chiarimenti tramite (Hidden by Airbnb) durante il nostro intero soggiorno! L'appartamento era esattamente come in foto, luminoso e pulito. Posizione molto comoda per spostarsi, la metro (chiamata tunnelbana) cosi come i pullman sono a due passi da casa, ristoranti, bar e supermercati idem. Consigliatissimo a tutti, grazie ancora Mikael!"

Mikael’s apartment is very clean with all the necessities we need for a short stay. Subway station, a pharmacy and several supermarkets are just around the corner.
I strongly recommend this apartment to those want to have a nice stay in Stockholm."
6574,954832,337372734,2018-10-16,218776589,Laurie,Mikael was such an amazing host! His place is just like it looks and is super clean. It’s also very close to the metro and bus stops. He was so helpful and answered questions for us the whole time we were there! Great experience all the way around!
6575,954832,340589093,2018-10-24,128938980,Greg,"Mikael was an outstanding host! The unit is small but immaculately clean, quiet, near shopping, restaurants, and transit -- perfect for one couple.  A great way to experience both nature and city life in Stockholm is to take the shoreline trail around the island of Kungsholen.  It's within easy walking distance from the unit and completely accessible to other parts of the island."
6576,954832,343024940,2018-10-30,69703155,Beverley,"Convenient location,  excellent subway, shops and restaurant access. Great host, well stocked, comfortable studio with many extra thoughtful additions.  Examples include maps and recommendations, multiple foreign plug adapters, coffee maker with  pods and basic condiments."
6577,954832,343973187,2018-11-02,43269551,Liz,Thank you SO SO SO very much for an outstanding stay. Our trip to Stockholm was exponentially better with Mikael’s help and guidance. The apartment was so clean and the bed was so comfortable after a long day of sight-seeing and “meeting” the city. Thank you again for everything- you are the best! 
6578,954832,346922487,2018-11-10,75489782,Abigail,Mikael's place was clean and comfortable. It was like he and his wife anticipated our every need even the things we didn't think of. Mikael's wife gave us a thorough run down of the apartment and there was lots of instructions that helped us with our stay. I would stay there again if I ever come back to Stockholm.
6579,954832,349929439,2018-11-18,22806081,Philipp,Sehr schicke und gut ausgestattete Wohnung. Mikael antwortet innerhalb von Minuten und steht immer mit Rat und Tat zur Seite! Absolute Empfehlung...

It was an amazing staying, excellent position, the apartment is lovely, with everything you can need (and something more!) I hope with all my heart we will be able to come back soon!"
6581,954832,356987429,2018-12-09,6174595,Gloria,"Mikael's apartment is what you need for a confortable visit to the city. Really close to 4 supermarkets and the underground, but also in a walking distance from all the sightseeings. The apartment is as shown in the pictures and Mikael was full-time available for any question or request. We consider him a really good host. We hope to stay in his apartment again in spring or summer."
6582,954832,358381937,2018-12-14,96125266,Patricia,"Mikael nos ha atendido muy bien. El apartamento estaba muy bien ubicado y era muy cosy, la verdad que no faltaba detalle. Recomendable 100% si quieres estar en el centro de la ciudad de Estocolmo!  Mikael es muy eficiente, amable y hospitalario.  Hasta nos dejó folletos para visitar la ciudad, no faltaba detalle."
6583,954832,360599498,2018-12-21,105997207,Ross,"This exceeded our expectations, very central, perfect for a couple visiting Stockholm"
6584,954832,366099545,2019-01-02,8046173,Andrew,Good location just a few minutes from the Underground/metro.  Compact but everything you need.  Mikael was very helpful especially as our arrival was delayed (drones!) and he stayed up late and even offered to get some essential supplies for us.
6585,954832,367565868,2019-01-05,1624181,Andrew,"If you’re staying with Mikael, you have chosen wisely. This crisply clean and well appointed place was perfect. It was central, both to shopping and eating places, it was clean and extremely well organised and it was a safe, comfortable and quiet little haven in a gorgeous city. It’s crowning glory however is Mikael. He is the perfect host; keen to ensure that we had everything, including maps and personal suggestions and the ‘need to know’ tips, like when to book the laundry and what to do when you fail!"
6586,954832,369342892,2019-01-10,202598892,Newton,"Mikael deserves the designation of a ""superhost"". As soon as his place was booked, he contacted us and gave us a warm welcome. He forwarded lists of interesting places to visit and eat, and things to do in Stockholm via email way before our arrival to help us plan our itinerary. He greeted us as soon as we entered the building, and his place is clean and cozy, enough for the 3 of us. The Fridhelmsplan T-Bana is just a 5-7 minute walk from his flat. There's also lots of eateries around, as well as a mall and 2 supermarkets nearby, an ICA and Coop. All the basic amenities were provided for. I would absolutely rent his place again when we return to Stockholm."
6587,954832,401609708,2019-01-15,30090292,Cyrielle,"Un hôte exceptionnel, un appartement parfait ! C’est la première fois que je rencontre un hôte aussi prévenant et gentil.

6588,954832,406832509,2019-01-31,14739209,Pauline,"Un petit cocon au coeur de Stockholm ! 
Nous avons passé 5 jours dans l'appartement de Mikael et nous serions bien restés plus longtemps ! L'appartement était parfaitement équipé et décoré et très confortable. Nous avons eu l'impression d'être chez nous. Mikael était au petit soin pour nous : toujours disponible si nous avions besoin de quelque chose et plein de bons conseils. 
L'appartement est un peu excentré (20-30 minutes à pied du centre-ville) mais il est proche de toutes commodités (commerces tout autour, métro à deux pas, bus pour l'aéroport à 10 min à pied) et cela vaut le coup de prendre le métro pour découvrir les stations toutes décorées ! De plus, si nous n'avions pas logé sur l'île de Kungsholmen, nous n'y serions surement pas allé. Il y a de jolies promenades à faire le long du lac Mälaren (tout gelé lorsque nous y étions : magnifique ! ) 
Bref, n'hésitez pas ! c'est une bonne adresse !"
6589,954832,408703517,2019-02-05,240564782,Christian,"Mikael är en mycket trevlig och omtänksam värd. Rent, fint, fräscht och skön säng."
6590,954832,409572138,2019-02-08,14286168,Alexander,"Great stay and would definitely recommend. Before our arrival Mikael sent through two documents explaining everything about the apartment, best way to get there and what to do in the local area. Check in was easy and quick. The apartment is nice, great amenities and in a great location, everything is walkable and Mikael had plenty of suggestions of what to do and what to see for our trip."

Definitely recommend this place!"
6597,954832,424862050,2019-03-17,105465570,Alan,"I've had the good fortune of staying at a number of great Airbnbs in the past, but Mikael's place was a star amongst stars. Check-in was super convenient; he was waiting at the flat when we arrived. Communication was impeccable; I got responses to all my messages within 10 mins pretty much (certainly within 30 mins). He even answered questions throughout my stay about restaurant recommendations and other tips (his recommendations were stellar!). He also helped me print my boarding pass. The place was very clean, with all the basic amenities. There is nothing not to like about this place. 5/5 across the board."
6598,954832,430309142,2019-03-30,68346864,Aliaksandr,"I highly recommend this place. Nice host which will provide answers for all your questions and will be stay in touch. Good place in city: close to metro, stores and cafes."

Great hosts- thank you for the great communication beforehand, meeting my friend and I outside the apartment to check in and for checking up on us throughout our stay. Had a lovely time visiting Stockholm."
6602,954832,440134725,2019-04-20,35690711,Maria,We enjoyed our 4 day stay very much. Mikael was the perfect host. He greeted us upon our arrival and was full of great tips for the city and the area!

6603,954832,446839252,2019-05-02,11812199,Azue,"Mikael is a lovely and warm host who was always quick to respond to my enquiries. Check in was quick and he gave a tour of the apartment. I travelled with my two year old toddler and Mikael’s apartment had everything that we needed - there were some small toys in the apartment that my son had fun playing. The apartment is in a good location, a few minutes walk to the metro station for two lines and the bus stops are also nearby. There is a shopping mall and supermarkets are also nearby. Thanks Mikael! :)"

6607,954832,457104821,2019-05-23,6813468,Melissa,This was a great home base while we spent a couple days exploring Stockholm. It’s close to grocery and transit. The apartment was very clean. I really appreciated that! We had all the basics. A simple stove and all basics to make some simple dishes for during the times we didn’t eat out at a local restaurant. Having two beds made it more comfortable. Mikael was quick to respond to any questions.

Wonderful space, full of many ""extras"" like umbrella, shopping bag, laundry soap etc. Mikael was the perfect blend of communication and privacy.

A wonderful stay."
6625,954832,527156686,2019-09-10,7554048,Elaine,"This place is a gem. It had everything that we needed for a very comfortable stay.  There are several good grocery stores (at least one with a large deli), a delightful bakery/coffee shop, wine shop and quite a few restaurants all in the neighbourhood.

Also a great place to relax when you get back with a nice sized kitchen, good local restaurants and cafes, and extremely quiet street outside.  Would definitely recommend

"
6639,974175,8497797,2013-11-03,9240552,Ingeborg Monique,"If you appreciate the combination of an elegant, artistic style and comfort this is the perfect place to stay in Stockholm! Sofie has a great taste and her beautiful, convenient ground floor appartment is full of nice things and good furniture. If you like cooking you will love her kitchen which has all the appliences you can think of.
The bright and roomy appartment lies on a quiet street in a lively neighbourhood with lots of nice stores and good restaurants closeby. If you want to go to the old town, the underground is just around the corner and the centre of Stockholm is just a few stops away. Sofie and Jesper are great hosts who will respond quickly if you have questions or remarks, They really want you to feel at home. And that is exactly what we did!"
6640,974175,8685334,2013-11-12,8159011,Adrian,"We stayed at Sofies lovely apartment for an extended weekend in november. It´s as beautiful as shown on the pictures and worth every penny.

The apartment is so incredibly beautiful, clean and stylish but yet you feel at home right away in the cosy atmosphere. Sofie was extremely helpful recommending places for eating, shopping and sightseeing before our arrival so that we could plan ahead. I'd go there again and would definitely recommend Sofies place to anyone going to Stockholm."
6642,974175,9587527,2014-01-03,9161406,Richard,"Sofie's Stockholm apartment is beautiful. It really is a nice place and I couldn't recommend it more. Everything is modern and up to date and it is just very nice. Sofie was easy to deal with in all respects. The apartment is completely as described. The location is in a seemingly professional suburb. Generally, the area is devoid of grafiti or any kind of shabby appearance. Leaves a great first impression of Stockholm. The apartment is a two minute walk from the Odenplan subway stop and getting round Stockholm by public transport is easy. One caveat to all this is that we stayed as a family with two boys aged 12 and 15. I'd think twice about taking my boys to this apartment again because they can be less than graceful and the apartment is SO NICE we were on pins and needles much of time worrying they were going to break something. But overall, you'll love it. Best apartment we stayed in in three cities this time. And Stockholm is terrific ! "
6643,974175,9825817,2014-01-13,9182854,Ilshat,"We stayed with 2 childs at Sofie's appartment in January 2014 and enjoyed it very much. The appartment is absolute nice, corresponds 100% to the photos shown at airbnb and we found it perfectly clean when arriving. The apartment was quiet and comfortable with ample supplies of coffee for the machine, a good fridge and the necessaries for basic cooking. The location is perfect with nice restaurants nearby and in walking distance to Stockholm center etc. The scenery around the apartment is very nice also and walking  is very enjoyable. We can 100% recommend this appartment to everyone looking for a nice place to stay during a Stockholm visit. Many thanks again to Sofie and Jesper!"
6644,974175,10421251,2014-02-18,10785149,Miranda,"We had a fantastic time staying at Sofie's apartment, it's beautifully decorated, comfortable and in a great location. Sofie was a great host - really friendly, and gave us advice on how to get there, get around Stockholm and left us a guidebook. The apartment is in a quiet, peaceful building, with shops, restaurants and bars just minutes away. We walked to most places but the metro is just around the corner as well. Sofie was really pleasant to liaise with, and I would definitely recommend staying here to anyone looking for a place in Stockholm!"
6645,974175,10533106,2014-02-24,10910630,Florence,"I stayed in Sofie’s apartment with 3 friends for a long weekend. The apartment was just perfect: it’s completely like the picture, it’s very spacious and well decorated and you can find everything you need during your stay. The apartment is 15 minutes’ walk from the center of Stockholm, so it’ very convenient! There is also a subway 3-4 minutes’ walk from the apartment, many restaurants and a supermarket close to the apartment. I would definitely recommend this place! "
6646,974175,11393001,2014-04-01,4118770,Annabelle,"Sofie appartement has a fantastic location, just 4 stations from Gamla Stan and is very nice. It was warm and cosy (we visited Stockholm in March). I visited with my parents and my boyfriend. The living and dinning room are great to have a good time with your family or friends (as long as you are too loud as it is a very quiet flat and area). I would definitely recommand!"
6647,974175,11530474,2014-04-07,10330042,Elizabeth,"Sofie was a terrific host: highly responsive and friendly.  The apartment was terrific: well placed, nice neighborhood, close to transportation.

It is a quiet neighbourhood and very close to the metro station. I would highly recommend Sofies place.
6649,974175,13595668,2014-06-01,1954500,Michaela,"I choosed Sofies apartment for a Stockholm trip with my elderly parents and it was the perfect accommodation for the four of us. Everything that has been written about Sofie as a host as well about the apartment is absolutely true and I can hardly add new facts.
From the first request onwards Sofie was extremely friendly, helpful and nice. She answered all questions before and during our stay quickly and detailed and was always ready to help. 
The apartment is brilliantly located and an excellent starting point for the exploration of Stockholm. What we liked in particular is the dining room which is really comfortable and spacious.
It goes without saying that we recommend this accomodation by all means."
6650,974175,14261425,2014-06-16,550533,Susann,"I, my Mom and Grandmother spend two nights at this lovely place. Sofie and her husband were very welcoming and helpful from the beginning. The apartment is close to the center with a lively neighborhood - but still quit.  I would recommend it to everybody! "

6653,974175,18314151,2014-08-25,1621491,Giulia,"Sofie was a wonderful hostess. She gaves us valuable guidance on how to move to the city and it has made available to the whole apartment. The apartment is as you see it in the picture, maybe even more beautiful. Comfortable, in a great location, close to metro and bus tunnelbana. We had some wonderful days in Stockholm thanks to Sofie and her hospitality."
6654,974175,18889194,2014-09-02,15056885,Caryn,Sofie has a beautiful home and very well equiped. She was very flexible with my key pickup since i was out of phone range for 4 days due to a cruise then when i got back i found out the day we were checking in that we were going to be on an all day trip north and not returning till very late Sophie arranged for the transfer of the key without any problems. Her home is very welcoming and she was available by phone when i needed a taxi.

6657,974175,22104417,2014-10-30,2802843,Garth,"Sofie and Jesper were the perfect hosts--very helpful and accessible without being overly eager. The apartment was immaculate! I think my best airbnb find to date! It was better than the pictures. In fact i think the pictures do not give the apartment justice! Its just way better in person. Located near a metro station with a lot of nearby grocery and shops, it is surprisingly quiet and cosy. I just love it. The only downside is that with such an awesome place to stay, you just dont wanna leave. You'll be tempted to have a staycation!"
6658,974175,23452021,2014-12-01,23118063,Amanda,Tack Sofie och Jesper för att vi fick förmånen att spendera vår Stockholmshelg i er charmiga och hemtrevliga lägenhet! Vi är väldigt nöjda med boendet och hur allt runt omkring sköttes. Området är mysigt och behagligt och dessutom perfekt avstånd till stan. Stort tack igen!
6659,974175,24740784,2015-01-02,8696401,Alice,"A real home away from home. Sofie very quick in replying to all my questions and had some great recommendations. 
The home is a real gem and we took away some great ideas for home decor. 
The area is very quiet and most of Stockholm's sights can be reached within 45 minutes , we barely needed public transport. 
Internet was great and we appreciated the Apple TV with Netflix for some relaxed evenings. 
I stayed in the ""children room"" and my parents in the main bedroom-both were fantastic. 
I recommend you at Sofie's place 100%"
6660,974175,25012932,2015-01-05,22122209,Friederike,"We had a splendid time in Stockholm and really enjoyed our stay in Sofies apartment. What beautiful rooms and such a lovely decoration :). We totally fell in love with it! Even went to planett and bolia where we could find some of the furniture *g*. The location is excellent, situated right in the middle so that Östermalm, Gamla Stan and Södermalm are easily reachable by feet or by tube. Sofie's mum took over the instructions about how to get in and was really helpful the whole stay - thanks for that, Monika. Really appreciated. We felt right at home and would love to come back one day!

6661,974175,25322237,2015-01-12,3319983,Chad,"Fantastic, Fantastic, Fantastic.   Could not have been much better.  The location is convenient to great shopping and restaurants.  Inside, the place is just as pictured.    Comfortable living room with TV and AppleTV.  Bedrooms are spacious and comfortable.    I will be begging Sofie to let me stay there again when I come back.
  She had someone meet me to check in and walk me thru all the details.  There was french press coffee available if needed

6663,974175,31290385,2015-05-04,21563791,Sarah,"Sophie and Jesper welcomed us upon arrival in their amazing appartement. As a group of 4 girls, we all envied the decoration of her appartement. Everything was explained very well and we felt right at home. 
We can only praise this apparement to other citytrippers! 
For us it was a first experience with Airbnb and it was a very good one.
One disadvantage? we couldn't take enough home in our bags :) 
Sophie and Jesper, thank you again for this amazing long weekend and opening up your home. You made us feel very welcome."
6664,974175,32443886,2015-05-18,21794938,Thomas,"Wir hatten mit unseren beiden Kindern eine wunderbare Zeit in Sofies Apartment. Jeder, der Gefallen an skandinavischem Design hat, wird die Einrichtung lieben, und es fehlte uns an absolut nichts. Wenn man unbedingt ein Haar in der Suppe finden will, dann das relativ kleine Bad, aber die Ausstattung ist insgesamt super. Die Raumaufteilung hat sich nach dem Einbau einer neuen offenen Küche etwas geändert, was uns noch besser gefällt. Überhaupt ist alles in Wirklichkeit (noch) schöner als abgebildet.
Die Lage in Vasastan ist fantastisch - als Ausgangspunkt für Besichtigungen und Shoppingtouren in der Innenstadt, in der Nachbarschaft findet man zahlreiche nette Cafes und Bars und gute Restaurants, und es ist dennoch sehr ruhig.
Mit Sofie haben wir nur per eMail kommuniziert. Das war alles sehr nett und unkompliziert und hat ausnahmslos hervorragend geklappt. Schade, dass wir uns nicht persönlich getroffen haben. Aber vielleicht klappt es ja beim nächsten Mal."
6665,974175,35193861,2015-06-16,22219496,Geoff,Enjoyed the locality and the convenience of being able to stay in such a lovely apartment.  Hosts were very helpful and we really appreciated the use of their home.

The flat was so beautiful with a lot of space and perfect from the location. The neighborhood is very quiet, clean and safe. It takes just a few minutes by tram or bus to get to the center of Stockholm.
We had everything that we need and felt totally in love with Sofies and Jespers flat. 
Everything was perfect and we felt very comfortable and would definitely come back! 
Tack så mycket for this nice stay.

Hälsningar!"

It is ideally located close to local shops and we were also able to walk to Old Stockholm (over the course of an afternoon!) and to the harbour. 
We were very impressed with our experience and would consider using this website again when booking a trip, particularly a city break. "
6669,974175,45765095,2015-09-06,23626978,Truus,"Sofie communicated via email and text and gave us clear instructions on how to access the apartment.  The apartment was clean, comfortable and very modern. Laminated instructions were left on the counter. Coffee and thee were provided, but no milk or sugar.  Shops for basic supplies were nearby. The location was  a few minutes from Odenplan metro station and lots of bus lines."
6670,974175,47027815,2015-09-15,12825460,Janine,"Very nice, clean and stylish appartment on a good location. We stayed here with five friends and had enough space. Located close to public transport, but even better: near the city bikes! We cycled through Stockholm and that was just great. Sofie, thanks a lot for staying at your place. "

Sofie manifestement aime cuisiner et s'est offert une cuisine digne d'un restaurant 3 étoiles! La station de métro est à deux pas et dessert la gare Centrale en deux minutes.

Sofie & Jesper ont été très chaleureux et accueillants avec nous. Leur appartement est plutôt spacieux (nous étions 5), moderne et joliment décoré. La cuisine est très moderne et bien équipée.
L'appartement est situé dans un quartier résidentiel plutôt calme, mais à une distance raisonnable à pied du centre-ville. Il y a une station de métro très proche, divers arrêts de bus, des commerces et des restaurants.

C'était l'appartement idéal pour notre séjour à Stockholm et il a largement contribué à la réussite de ce week-end entre filles!

6676,974175,57013399,2015-12-21,16474465,Shona,"Sofie was kind and warm in all her communication. The flat was easy to find and it is in a lovely,  quiet,  safe , residential area. We could walk everywhere and there are lots of cool friendly cafes in the immediate area. The flat is more beautiful than in the photos. Warm, clean and easy to be in. It smells lovely. Sofie very kindly left biscuits and milk . We would very happily stay there again and highly recommend it. Thank you Sofie!"
6677,974175,59146101,2016-01-07,9566732,Kristina,"Wir haben uns bei Sofie & Jesper sehr wohl gefühlt. Die Wohnung ist für 5-6 Personen komfortabel, die Betten auch für Erwachsene wunderbar. Dass es nur ein Bad bzw. eine Toilette gibt, erfordert ein wenig Koordination, aber die Vorteile der Wohnung machen dies wett. Die große Küche mit Esstisch lädt mit vielen Highlight zu gemütlichen Abenden ein, an Ausstattung hat man alles was das Herz begehrt. Der große Garten und das Haus waren sehr gepflegt. Die Lage der Wohnung ist optimal, um Stockholm zu erkunden. Bus und Metro fahren nur wenige Meter entfernt ab, ab der Haltestelle Odenplan erreicht man alle wichtigen Punkte meist sogar ohne umsteigen. Wir würden definitiv wiederkommen!"

Sofie ja Jesper olivat vastassa sovitusti ja kävivät läpi olennaisimmat asiat. Asunto on kaunis ja moderni, yksityiskohdat on mietitty viimeistä piirtoa myöten. Sijainti on hyvä.

Wir waren über Ostern zu Gast in Sofies und Jespers Wohnung und haben uns dort sehr wohl gefühlt. Sie ist ideal für 4 Personen. Wir waren dort mit 3 Erwachsenen und unserem 2-jährigen Sohn. Auch für unseren Mini war alles vorhanden, was benötigt wurde (Kinderbett, Hochstuhl etc.) Die Wohnung ist sehr stilvoll und gemütlich eingerichtet. Innerhalb von 10 Min ist man auf der Haupteinkaufsstraße Stockholms, innerhalb von 25 Min zu Fuß in Stockholms Altstadt. Auch die Anbindung an öffentliche Verkehrsmittel ist optimal. Da die Gastgeber während unseres Besuchs selbst verreist waren, haben wir sie nicht persönlich getroffen. Während der gesamten Zeit hatten wir aber sehr netten Kontakt per (Hidden by Airbnb) und viele tolle Tipps für Stockholm lagen in der Wohnung bereit.

Thanks for a wonderful time in your flat, Sofie & Jesper"

There appliances are almost too good to be true (they have a golden Quooker and a dishwasher that opens when you knock friendly on its door) We felt at home right away and had a great time with our two young sons. The neighborhood is nice and calm with many cafes and small shops, the park nearby was perfect with a good playground. Communications were easy and there were lots of travel tips to help us out. We had a wonderfull time!  "

6692,974175,94477459,2016-08-15,5845263,Steven,"Jesper and Sofie's flat is absolutely beautiful.  It was exactly as described.

Jesper and Sofie made sure that we knew exactly how to get to the flat and greeted us upon arrival - walking through everything we needed to know and make sure all our questions were answered.  They were so welcoming and kind.

The flat is in a beautiful, quiet location - close to the metro and many amenities.  It was safe and extremely clean.  The flat itself is absolutely beautiful and we felt at home during our stay.  

Jesper and Sofie were available throughout our holiday in case we had any questions or needed anything additional.  They were so kind and helpful.

A wonderful holiday and a wonderful flat.  We would look forward to staying there again if in Stockholm.

6693,974175,105777065,2016-10-02,65679773,Chevonne,"We had a fantastic weekend in Stockholm. Sofie and Jesper are lovely hosts and their home is very clean and well equipped. The beds were very comfortable and we were very impressed with the instant hot water in the kitchen for coffee, tea and cooking! The apartment is close to local amenities and we actually took a nice walk right into the centre of Stockholm. The only thing I think worth mentioning is that there are cameras in the kitchen area and the bedroom with the bunk beds. This was fine with us although my daughters were staying in the bedroom with the bunk beds and felt uneasy when getting undressed so we covered the camera at times but then uncovered when we left. The apartment looks much more fabulous in real life than in the pictures so we were really pleasantly surprised when we arrived. 
Overall we really enjoyed our stay and would love to stay again should we return to Stockholm in the future! Thanks for having us! "
6694,974175,107402017,2016-10-10,4985373,Kim,"Everything was just GREAT! The host Jesper welcomed me and my friends in his apartment. He gave us a ""house tour"" by introducing everything in his house, so you don't have to guess what in where or how to use the things. The house equipped with high-tech appliances and they are super users-friendly! They got everything in their kitchen and it's big, made us cooked twice in 3 nights. Everything in the house was clean. They have 3 rooms for total, the host will ask your sleeping preference before your arrival and set up accordingly. Apple TV is provided, so you can watch some movies. Just 2-3 stations to T-centralen (The Central) and Galamstan (Old Town), 5 mins walk to ""T"" Tunnuelbana. It's convenience.

Seriously, I'm kind of perfectionist but the experience in Jesper's place was really over the top. It delighted our trip in Stockholm indeed.

I will definitely recommend Jesper's place to everyone who can keep the place clean. =)"
6695,974175,110017249,2016-10-23,44016096,Michelle,The apartment was gorgeous and homely. Even nicer in real life. We enjoyed our stay and the apartment sonos system was great for getting ready. The only negative was the camera as it's not something we are used to in the UK. A (Hidden by Airbnb) search set our minds at rest though. All good. Great place. Great location. Sofie was on hand to help us our trip and kindly let us keep our bags there on sunhat afternoon. Thanks J&S x

The location is ideal: close to public transport, right in the centre but in a calm area. The interior of the apartment is super stylish. Nice wooden floors, antique details, modern tools, lots of plants, nice decoration, ...  The kitchen is very nice, and very well-equipped. 
The perfect place for a stay in Stockholm! "
6697,974175,115916376,2016-11-27,56447091,Jo,"Sofie was welcoming from the moment we booked this stunning apartment - she helped us with recommendations for places to eat & drink, even shop and she was there to welcome us/show us around her stylish apartment on arrival. Everything we wanted and needed was there, Sofie even left us some milk in the fridge, she was super thoughtful! We loved this apartment, it was even better than the listing had suggested, beds were extremely comfortable and the kitchen gadgets had us gasping in awe - such a great find! 
Highly rated places to visit/eat/drink - The Brunch Club, Phil's Burgers, The illuminated Reindeer at Nybroplan, Vasa Museum, Svenskt Tenn for a pot of tea and a great shopping experience, Lagerhaus for discount homewares and curious gift ideas, Fotografiska in Södermalm at night followed by dinner at Meatballs for The People, Pharmarium for a crazy cocktails in Gamla Stan, Coffee at johan & nyström, Breakfast pastries at Fabrique (many different bakeries around the City to sample their treats!) - it snowed too, so we got to wear our snowboots and enjoy a cram-packed long weekend in Stockholm! 
This apartment has great wifi access, comfy beds, a homely living room of which we enjoyed watching Netflix and curled up under blankets one evening, the bathroom is a joy to shower in (even towels and hairdryer was provided), the kitchen is well stocked and we loved drinking wine from the glasses provided - a well- thought out apartment/home. The artwork is great to look at and the addition of a new fire burner was welcomed - we didn't use it in the end, but Sofie showed us how to use it if we fancied a real fire - a very unexpected & pleasant addition!
Thank you so much to our hosts, we didn't want to leave! If you are looking for somewhere to stay in Stockholm, this couldn't be rated highly enough - it's easy to get to/explore from, a great base to explore a fun City! "

We stayed in their lovely apartment twice on our visits to Stockholm! Everything went very smoothly including clear instructions on how to check in. The apartment is really lovely with nice decor and fantastic appliances. The sound system especially is so cool, u can download an app and play your own songs as you cook! Everything that you would neeed to make this apartment feel like home is here! My kids didn't want to leave the apartment at all. There were nice touches like milk and cookies and candles . It really made us feel as if we were at home away from home. We are a family of 5 and the apartment was comfy and big enough for us.  Everyone had their own space. I highly recommend this lovely apartment should you decide to come to Stockholm.  Thanks so much Sofie and Jesper for making this a lovely holiday for us to remember ! "

Vi var 5 stk på jentetur og stortrivdes i denne perlen;) Utrolig lugn og fin stemning i hele leiligheten, vakkert innredet og dekorert, masse plass til alle 5, rett og slett skikkelig luksus! Nabolaget er rolig, kort vei til både restauranter og kafeer. Vertenes anbefalinger er verdt å sjekke! Vi kommer garantert tilbake;) Takk for oss"
6700,974175,138521453,2017-03-20,9552970,Jo,"We had a great stay at Jesper & Sofie's place ... it's located in a quiet area close to a metro station and some nice restaurants. The perfect location to have an active time in Stockholm and find some rest during the evening. All comfort you need you will find in this appartment. If you visit Stockholm, this is the place to be ... we'll be back for sure !!!"
6701,974175,145420043,2017-04-18,73542514,Felicitas,A really lovely place! Close to public transport and in a nice area. Jesper and Sofie were super helpful and everything we could need was provided. We would absolutely stay at their place again!
6702,974175,152153766,2017-05-15,95881077,Barry,"An absolutely beautiful apartment which is much bigger than the photos suggest. The location is great if you want somewhere a little outside the centre (maybe 20 minutes walk which is perfect for a pre and post wander after a days sight seeing). There is also plenty to see and do around the apartment area including parks, restaurants and bars. We didn't catch the metro much as preferred to walk but it's very close and reliable.
Although the apartment is very stylish we felt extremely at home and didn't feel as if we were in a 'display house' ... it's a warm, relaxing home.
Each room is very well appointed, especially the kitchen, perfect if you plan to eat in from time to time (you'll probably not find or be able to open the bin for a few attempts but that was part of the fun!). The addition of SONOS throughout was a huge bonus as we use that all the time at home.
The area is lovely and quiet so you'll be sure of a perfect nights sleep in the super comfortable bed.
Sofie was extremely helpful from the point of booking right through to the duration of our stay and was quick to respond and help when we needed help / advice.

I can't recommend this apartment more highly, it was perfect."
6703,974175,153451510,2017-05-21,3425387,Brian,Jesper and Sofie have a beautiful home that they vacate for guests.  They were prompt and courteous and the location is excellent.

This is a lovely, comfortable and quiet apartment in an excellent location for reaching the centre of Stockholm on the metro (2-3 stops).

He went out of his way and actually picked us up from the station to help us out. The apartment was quiet, clean and beautiful. We didn’t get to spend much time there as we were out the entire day. It has all the utilities you need. Nothing but good things to say. Thank you Jesper and Sofie :)"

The apartment worked really well with our family - very stylish whilst being easy to settle in.  Sonos and Apple TV are great additions.  The apartment is very well connected with the metro only a 5 minute walk (for a 3 year old) and the old town within 15 minutes on the metro.

Although August was not in the city during my stay, he has organized an efficient support network of friends and family that were always helpful. This place is highly recommended!!!

6758,975364,316042661,2018-08-30,175444386,Maggen,Max is a nice host. He wasn't there often but if we had some question he always replied quickly. The flat is very central in Södermalm. There are bus stations and a metro station near by. The kitchen is the heart of the flat. There you have much space to prepare and enough place to sit and eat or enjoy with some tea. In the bedroom you also have much space. The bed is big but there is only one blanket. You have a couch but it isn't very clean. The closet is big enough for two people but very dusty on the ground. The room door is very loud and the curtains are transparent so it was very bright in the room every morning. The bathroom ist really small. The shower is very nice but after you took a shower the whole ground is wet. For us it was very practical to have a supermarket near by :)
6759,985944,4568517,2013-05-13,5594641,Tommi,"Really great place to stay in Stockholm! The apartment was beautiful and cozy, the neighbourhood was wonderful and the hosts really nice. Warm recommendation!"

Spacious living with high ceilings, comfy beds, a lovely kitchen with all the things you need, big dining area and sun-trap balcony, a second living area with couches and (very cool) chairs, beautifully and imaginatively decorated and lit throughout, awesome record collection and great speaker set up to play it through the flat, brilliant powerful shower, and all in a perfect location for getting on the metro or just wandering out to some great restaurants, uber-cool bars and the park and waterfront.

Fabulous, thanks!"
6761,985944,5783139,2013-07-16,6151371,Jack,"This was my first airbnb stay, and I can only dream that subsequent bookings will be this good!

Anna accommodated me and my friends perfectly. She is great at communication, and always accessible via SMS or email. The apartment was clean, and all necessities were catered for.  She even had a little welcome package for us, with Swedish treats like Herring!

The apartment is spectacular and the photo's uploaded do it no justice. It is a close walk from the centre of stockholm, a few doors down from the subway, and located in a trendy area, full of vintage stores, bistro's and cafe's.

Would absolutely recommend and use again. Perfect host, perfect apartment.

La coordinación de la llegada fue óptima, nos esperaba su sobrina a la hora concertada. Anna nos dejó un documento bastante detallado con instrucciones tanto de temas prácticos (electrodomésticos, tiendas, etc) como con recomendaciones sobre los sitios de interés del barrio. Encontré que había bastantes plazas en los alrededores para aparcar en la calle (pagando), un tema que me preocupaba antes de llegar, y el barrio me pareció muy seguro. La ubicación es muy cómoda tanto para ir en metro al centro (estación a 100m) o incluso caminando (20min). También pudimos salir fácil y rápidamente con el coche para nuestras excursiones en los alrededores de Estocolmo. Ademas el barrio tiene su propio interés y está muy bien dotado de zonas comerciales y de ocio. Gracias a Anna por facilitarnos una muy agradable estadía en Estocolmo."

There was so much space that we never knew if we should hang out in the beautiful kitchen or the cozy living room. The beds were super comfy, nice bathroom too. It's a 2-3 minute walk to the nearest bus and metro stop. You could even walk to the Gamla Stan (old town) if you wanted (20-30 minutes). The apartment is located near good restaurants, pubs and cute boutiques. Anna responds quickly to every question you may have. She left us an instructional booklet for the apartment that also included recommendations for shopping/restaurants/tours. She even found us a high chair for our baby! Anna is an amazing super host with a beautiful apartment. Definitely one of my top Airbnb experiences. Thanks again Anna!"
6770,985944,506954900,2019-08-11,64828347,Melanie,"Anna’s place is very comfortable for 4 adults or a family and is filled with natural light.  It is very close to the T and there are a number of cafes within 5 minutes from the apartment.  We were very happy to do laundry too.  The washers and dryers were very efficient.  Thanks Anna for being a wonderful host.

The apartment is nice and clean and it has a great balcony with lots of sun! Location is also good its next to the city, Vasastan and Sodermalm. Highly recommended!"
6772,1035775,6876458,2013-08-28,6801130,Natalya,"We had a great Stockholm weekend at Magnus' apartment. It's clean and cozy, and nicely located near a place to swim. 5 minute walk to the metro and 10 minutes with the metro to downtown Stockholm, so good location. Magnus was nice and accommodating, put out an extra mattress for a friend who was staying one night."
6773,1035775,7353020,2013-09-16,8683633,Côme,"Our stay at Magnus's place was truly great. The apartment is super clean and very comfortable. The balcony is great to enjoy the sun !
In total, by walking + taking the subway, we were at only 15 minutes from T-Centralen, which is truly great, the neighborhood is very calm. I can only recommend you to stay at Magnus's place whenever you need to stay in Stockholm ! Thanks again for this great stay ! :)"
6774,1035775,7783103,2013-10-02,1671710,Ksenia,"I had a good time staying at this apartment in Stockholm. the place was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The size of the apartment was perfect for me but i think it would still be good for a couple. it actually looks much better than in photos. it's very light and has a good energy. The thing that attracted me the most is that Magnus does not charge any extra fees eg cleaning,towels...I just wished there was a microwave. but there is a pizza place (which was average) and a Thai place (which was tasty) down the road. there is also a supermarket next to the train station. Do stay here, it's a great deal. Thanks for having me Magnus! 5 stars"
6775,1035775,8264605,2013-10-22,4140178,Nicoleta,"Nice apartment,with a sunny balcony,good location in the city.Magnus was very helpful host,the communication was good.Definitely recommended. "
6776,1035775,9521951,2014-01-01,5149773,Capucine Et Clément,"We enjoyed to stay at Magnus flat. It was clean, close to the center and easy to get there (bus and metro). The flat was also bright which is great for Stockholm! We felt like at home.
Magnus is a great host! You can rely on him."
6777,1035775,12711287,2014-05-09,7576708,Sean,Our stay at Magnus place was fantastic. It is the perfect size for a couple of people to stay. The kitchen is small but very well equipped. There are a couple of grocery stores near by so we were able to make breakfasts and a nice meal in the apartment. His place is just about 10 minutes from the center of Stockholm which was fantastic since we had the Stockholm card during our stay. I would love to stay at his place again. 
6778,1035775,17043716,2014-08-06,12990582,Laura,"Our stay in Stockholm was absolutely lovely and Magnus was a big reason we had such a positive experience. His apartment was the perfect size for a couple, with a great kitchen for cooking and a wonderful balcony for enjoying our meals. The location of the apartment (on the island of Kungsholmen) was very convenient for travel throughout all of Stockholm via both bus and metro. Magnus was very communicative with us before, during and even after our stay. He was quick to answer emails and provide us with thoughtful answers to our queries and during our stay we communicated via WhatsUp for any other questions we had. Magnus was a superb host and we would stay in his flat again in a heartbeat! "
6779,1035775,17268020,2014-08-10,9426704,Ines,"Magnus was a very helpful and very friendly host. His flat is nicely located in a quiet neighbourhood of central Stockholm but you can reach the city by Bus within 10-15 min.
In the flat you can find everything you need and are allowed to use it during your stay. Only the bed is quite small when you are used to a proper bed for a couple. 
Thank you very much Magnus for having us. We had a really good time at your place and fell in love with your city. :)"
6780,1035775,18111641,2014-08-22,12378028,Antonella, Wonderful small apartment in a quite area. Magnus was very kind and precised to give us information to arrive to the apartment.
6781,1035775,18419253,2014-08-26,7800571,Fei,"We stayed at Magnus flat for 4 nights. Magnus was a helpful and friendly host. His flat is clean, well-equipped and attractive. Upon arrival he recommended some good places to go. The size of the bed was fine for us but it would be small for a larger couple. We had a good time in Stockholm and Mangus' place. Highly recommended. "
6782,1035775,18560838,2014-08-28,19297203,Susanne,"We enjoyed our stay at Magnus' flat very much. It's clean, the bed is comfortabel, super furnishing, location is very good...all in all one of the best opportunities for a low-cost stay near the center. I loved the big balcony with sun during the afternoon and evening! Thank you Magnus! I will recommend your stylish flat!"
6783,1035775,23621963,2014-12-07,17419351,Árni,Everything worked according to plan. Magnus had an extra mattress for us ready when we came. Got two pairs of keys. Everything clean and comfortable. Contacted him a few times and got a quick reply every time. Would recommend this apartment any day :)
6784,1035775,24814018,2015-01-03,3982542,Valery & Yuliya,Отличное место и гостепреимный хозяин. Хорошо подойдет для 2 человек
6785,1035775,33774115,2015-06-01,3961178,Gill & John,"We had a wonderful time in Stockholm and Magnus' apartment was just as described. Everything you could possibly need was available ( including an excellent Indian restaurant in the apartment block!). We had space to hang clothes, a comfortable bed, the balcony would have been lovely (had it ever stopped raining!) and the public transport links from the local bus stop and metro station were perfect - straight to central Stockholm. Should we visit again, I would have no hesitation in asking Magnus to be our host . Highly recommended - and next time it would be great to meet too!"
6786,1035775,37568286,2015-07-08,33418068,Angela,"Magnus's flat is so great and we do love it so much. The flat is clean, tidy and well-equipped. We love the surrounding area with beautiful grassland. It's near to the T-bana station and also bus stop. 
Magnus is a very nice host and he had very prompt replies. He provided an extra mattress for us, which was very kind of him.
We definitely recommend his flat to those who will live in Stockholm."
6787,1035775,43756021,2015-08-22,32487108,Aron,Nice appartement with balcony. Elevator and not far away from water.
6788,1035775,51895438,2015-10-25,38287628,Rodrigo,"Apartment well located with easy access to metro, Magnus gave us all necessary support. I recommend."
6789,1035775,54278139,2015-11-17,47542562,Ester,"Ho scelto questo appartamento per mio fratello, dato che non mi era possibile ospitarlo a casa mia, vivo infatti a Stoccolma, a pochi passi dall'appartamento di Magnus. La zona e' molto bella e tranquilla a pochi passi c'e' la stazione della metro e una fermata con due linee di bus. Raggiungere il centro storico di Stoccolma risulta molto facile e rapido. L'appartamento e' molto accogliente e pulito con un bel terrazzino. In cucina c'e' tutto il necessario per prepararsi da mangiare. Consigliato e sicuramente lo terro' in considerazione quando amici/parenti verranno a trovarmi a Stoccolma!"
6790,1035775,62240852,2016-02-13,10483558,Nour,"Magnus was really nice and helpful, it was a pleasure to meet him! 
The apartment looks exactly like the pictures. It's cosy, clean, fully equipped and well located.
We highly recommend this apartment :) 

(PS : the bed suits more for a couple)"
6791,1035775,63195142,2016-02-21,3568685,Blanca,"Magnus was a great host, he provided us very detailed instruction for getting the apartment and was always reachable. He waited us at the apartment and explained us how everything worked. The apartment is cool and confortable, we had no issues at all and we spent a very great time there. The place is well communicated by metro and bus. "
6792,1035775,66595561,2016-03-23,59867986,Tim,"Cozy apartment with a good connection to the S-Train.
Magnus is a great guy.. He explained us everything so good and answered quickly if we had some questions.
We enjoyed our stay in Stockholm."
6793,1035775,69955232,2016-04-15,24763085,Eline,"We had a great time staying at Magnus' apartment. The place was as described – a clean apartment near the city center. It was also really a really cozy apartment, fully equipped with everything you need if you don't want to eat out every day. We really felt at home! It is located in a peaceful neighborhood and the subway is close by so it is easy to reach the city center. Magnus was a very welcoming and helpful host. He gave us very clear directions on how to travel directly from the airport to his apartment. We highly recommend this place!"
6794,1035775,71929575,2016-04-29,1486275,Damian,"Magnus was a great host, he communicated well leading up to us arriving, was there to show us the key points of his flat, then gave us space while we were there.

His apartment was small but nice, but we did notice some issues between what we expected and what was actually there. The listing said the apartment had a washing machine, but there definitely wasn't one in the apartment. All I can think of for this is that there may be a laundry in the building that Magnus forgot to mention. The second thing that the bed is quite small, we had booked as a couple but no way could we both sleep comfortably on the one bed, so one of us had to sleep on the couch. Lastly, the pictures show a table and chairs on the balcony, but it was bare during our stay. It didn't overly bother us as it was so cold we wouldn't have used it anyway, but it was not as it is pictured on the listing."
6795,1035775,74723402,2016-05-16,28876584,Virginie,"Nice flat, very clean! about 4 km from center.
thank you to magnus, he's a great host and  explain us what we would like to know about Stockholm."
6796,1035775,80008947,2016-06-15,14460859,Katia,"Magnus was a great host and always responded quickly to our questions. The apartment isn't very close to the touristic centers of Stockholm but it lies next to a beautiful path along the sea which will show you the real beauty of the city, in our opinion. And the railway network is well organised so getting to the other islands is very easy. The apartment has everything you need for a short stay in Stockholm. The only thing we didn't like was the small bed but we should have read about that beforehand. Magnus was very helpful in providing an extra mattress. "
6797,1035775,81508380,2016-06-23,27559979,Barbara,"We enjoyed staying at Magnus's place, and Stockholm was amazing! He provided good directions to his flat from the harbor and was helpful when we had questions. The tram station requires a bit of walking, but it is very pleasant and pretty in good weather. Would not advise having a lot of big luggage, however.  Magnus greeted us in person, explained things, and was very welcoming. The flat is bright, modern, and comfortable for 2 people.  The building has a lift and a great clothes washing facility. Magnus reserved our access, which worked well for us."
6798,1035775,86026747,2016-07-14,25815025,Kris,I would highly recommend Magnus' apartment! It was conveniently located and immaculately clean.  Magnus was impeccable with his communication and was awaiting us when we arrived from the airport.  I would stay there again when I return to Stockholm. 
6799,1035775,94779884,2016-08-17,78236369,Jinju,"The flat was great and Magnus was so kind even if i checked in so late. He picked me up from the subway station. The room is very cosy and close to the subway and bus station. I just enjoyed while i was staying.  
"
6800,1035775,97139431,2016-08-26,86922601,Frans,"De verhuurder was aanwezig op het afgesproken tijdstip. Hij had een nauwkeurige beschrijving gegeven van de manier waarop we de woning konden vinden.
Hij had koffie voor ons ingekocht.
Omdat het bed aan de smalle kant was heeft hij voor een tweede matras gezorgd zonder dat we dat hoefden te vragen."
6801,1035775,99308007,2016-09-04,36760820,Lucas,"Lovely app and friendly host, I recommend."
6802,1035775,141369196,2017-04-02,58045686,Fumi,The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6803,1035775,148830324,2017-05-01,5169295,Fathi,"Very nice flat ! Magnus is very good host, very reactive and very helpful to visit Stockholm"
6804,1035775,155130324,2017-05-27,13431998,Nadia,"Studio fonctionnel à 5 minutes du métro pour le centre ville
Très bonne communication
Je recommande "
6805,1035775,177254325,2017-08-02,14195660,Ken,"Magnus' space is the perfect size for a single or couple travelers. The patio is gorgeous for morning coffee, it's in a nice area close to the metro as well! Magnus was very helpful and always available for us if needed. He greeted us upon arrival and showed us around, which was very nice. Definitely recommended for anyone staying in Stockholm!"
6806,1035775,186066512,2017-08-23,102739769,Alfonso,"Really cosy and clean apartment, perfect for a couple. Magnus was really helpful providing us with useful tips for sightseeing Stockholm."
6807,1035775,269816715,2018-05-28,33129869,Arun,"Fantastic location. Great apartment, had everything we wanted. Kristineberg metro station was only a few minutes walk away. Magnus was very prompt with his responses. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Stockholm."
6808,1035775,276873136,2018-06-15,192626169,Magnus,"En liten lägenhet med stor balkong. Fungerar alldeles utmärkt för ett par nätters övernattning. Läget är bra för den som skall jobba på Kungsholmen som jag gjorde, och det är väldigt nära centrum. WiFI var snabb och bra. Värden svarade snabbt på frågor och anpassade incheckningstiden när mitt tåg blev inställt och jag kom fram senare. Kan vara bra att veta att det är gasspis i köket. Microvågsugnen är gömd i skåpet ovanför kylskåpet."
6809,1035775,308776767,2018-08-17,29094629,Anass,"My parents visited me a couple of days, and as I could not host them, they have stayed in Magus' apartment. Their impression is very positive. The apartment was clean, has all what is needed and is close to the metro station. It is also a calm neighborhood. The apartment is ideal for couples and I recommend you strongly to book it if you come to Stockholm. Thank you Magnus !"
6810,1035775,319344299,2018-09-06,44593251,Ron,A cozy studio apartment. Perfect for a couple or single.  Magnus was a great host; responsive and welcoming. The balcony was great for morning coffee.  A bit further from the city. Find the Metro (subway) at Thordisplan and it's easy quick ride to all Stockholm has to offer
6811,1035775,349819295,2018-11-18,27966042,Daniel,Nice apartment in fredhäll. Quick access to subway.
6812,1035775,447737398,2019-05-04,84261955,Agnese,The studio is cozy and clean. Magnus is always available for help!
6813,1035775,451799068,2019-05-12,259249394,Linda,"Trevligt boende, rent och lagom stort för några nätter. Välfungerande kommunikation med värd, flexibel med in- och utcheckning vilket var ett stort plus.. Kom och mötte upp på centralen för överlämning av nycklar vilket var väldigt smidigt. Positiv upplevelse."
6814,1035775,463852143,2019-06-04,9500437,Anne,"Studio tout simple joli fonctionnel et cosy. Quelques minutes à pied d'une des lignes principales de metro. Parfait pour un court séjour à Stockholm. Tout proche d'une très jolie balade au bord de l'eau qui mène vers le centre ville!!! Un petit bémol pour le balcon qui donne au loin sur une route à grand trafic, mais pas dérangeante pour dormir avec les fenêtres fermées. Merci à Magnus pour sa disponibilité et son accueil!"
6815,1038408,18954649,2014-09-03,10208094,Joachim,"Kristoffer is a really nice guy. We met him for the key delivery and had a pleasant talk. He told us where important things are and gave us some groceries on house. 
Kristoffer's home is really lovely and classy arranged with a pretty well equipped kitchen and a big living room (with an Apple TV, iPod docking station and a lot of books) with a dining area for four people. 
The bathroom ist not the latest - but for my girlfriend an me totally adequate. 
Just the bed was too small and soft for our 7 day stay - but this is a matter of opinion. 
Also brilliant was the short walk to the metro. It's just 500m away. 

All in all: the perfect home for a short stay in beautiful Stockholm! Commendable! "
6816,1038408,24655266,2015-01-01,3661023,Andrei,"We are happy we choose Kristoffer's apartment for our stay in Stockholm. The flat is not big but nice and cozy, and in a quiet neighborhood. Kristoffer wasn't able to meat us but he did everything to make sure we get a key. We had a positive experience overall. Oh, and special thanks for musical instruments."
6817,1038408,40301432,2015-07-29,36878774,Patricia,The host canceled this reservation 11 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6818,1038408,518044304,2019-08-26,21457360,Tana,"- Mattress & bedding: 
1. The duvet and pillow stank of sweat etc. Covering it with a washed pillow case & duvet cover did not disguise the smell (i bought my own duvet & pillow the next day).

2. the mattress was old and sank in the middle. Another guest had already remarked that it was soft (and a personal preference). Preference has nothing to do with it. It's old and sinking.

- Bathroom: it's dated and for a few days you could cope. But after a week it doesn't make you feel clean. The sink has stains on it that no amount of cleaning can remove. And let's not mention the toilet. The shower head doesn't stay up. The shower curtain stinks.

Location: 
It's an hour away on foot to the city centre. You can cycle there (if it's not snowing) otherwise you'll need to use their public transport which is expensive. 

Size: it's more a studio than a 1 bedroom flat. The ""bedroom"" is really small it can only be described as a box room with a single bed. Two guests would not comfortably stay there. There is a sofa but that's not the most comfortable either and there's no extra bedding."
6819,1038408,524110979,2019-09-05,217862218,Zoe,Great!
6820,1041103,4534392,2013-05-11,5802424,Sheri,"Beautiful, large apartment in a lovely neighborhood. Karoline welcomed us with a well-stocked refrigerator and other goodies and gave us recommendations for local eateries and shops. The apartment is only a few metro stops from Stockholm's T-Centralen, the main station, so it is very conveniently located. The three bedrooms gave us plenty of space (our three grown sons traveled with us) and having the kitchen saved us a lot of money by not having to eat out every meal. (Tip: If you DO want to eat out close to the apartment one night, try JJ's to Go, a faulous Thai place with delicious food--very popular with the locals, as well.). Karoline has a lovely apartment, and the easy access to central Stockholm makes it a perfect place to come ""home"" to after a busy day of sight-seeing and shopping. Highly recommended. We will definitely stay here again on our next visit to beautiful Stockholm. Thanks, Karoline, for making us feel so very welcome!"
6821,1041103,4711523,2013-05-21,4721604,Antóin,"This is a great apartment, with lots of space and 3 bedrooms, which makes it very comfortable. Karoline was very welcoming, and we really felt at home, in her home! The apartment is only a 2minute walk to the metro, which is 4-5 stops to the centre of Stockholm. We really enjoyed staying here, and would definitely return."
6822,1041103,4942894,2013-06-03,2062760,Dorothe,"We had a great stay at Karolines apartment. It is easy to get to the city (by bike or by metro), well equiped, clean, perfect for our group and very child friendly.  And on top we had a very warm welcome, including breakfast for the next morning. Thank you!
Beside the metro which is just around the corner, there are also some restaurants, a supermarket, a bakery and a really good coffee place just across the street. We rented bikes and enjoyed cycling in Stockholm."
6823,1041103,5087401,2013-06-11,5574312,Clemens,"We really enjoyed our stay at Karoline's place. The apartment is spacious and the furniture gives it a really nice atmosphere. The location is pretty good with some small restaurants, a supermarket and the metro station just one block away. And even if you miss the last metro it shouldn't take much longer than a one hour walk from Gamla Stan.
When we entered the flat we were happily surprised by cookies, fruits and some stuff for breakfast which Karoline bought for us.
Check-In and Check-Out was very uncomplicated and Karoline was also very helpful when we had question concerning the flat or other things in Stockholm.
When I'm going to Stockholm again she will be my first person to contact."
6824,1041103,5751618,2013-07-15,1882791,Zoe,Karoline's apartment is very nice and spacious. Great location for the center of Stockholm and for the conference center Stockholmsmassan. I would definitely stay there again if in Stockholm. Very quiet neighbourhood with good facilities close by. 
6825,1041103,5910407,2013-07-22,4137561,Susie,"We had an excellent stay at Karoline's place. We did not have the chance to meet in person but she arranged someone to hand us the keys, despite our very late arrival. The fridge was stocked amply with breakfast goods and the location was very convenient for exploring the city."
6826,1041103,6046207,2013-07-28,5193458,Laura,We really enjoyed staying in Karoline's apartment. It was big enough for all of us (a family of 5 people). The apartment is very cosy and everything was just perfect. It's situated close to Stockholm's centre and I'd reccomend this apartment to anyone!
6827,1041103,6955516,2013-09-01,6299106,Paula,"Alles in allem: zusammen mit unseren Freunden aus Italien hatten wir einen tollen Aufenthalt in einer tollen Unterkunft.
Karoline war sehr freundlich, hilfsbereit und zuverlässig. Ich konnte sie jederzeit kontaktieren und bekam schnell eine Antwort.
Die Lage der Wohnung ist optimal. Sehr nah an der U-Bahn Station. Gleich daneben hat es einen Supermarkt, der bis 23h geöffnet hat. Man ist mit der Tunnelbanan sofort im Zentrum, von wo aus mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln alles leicht erreichbar ist. Die Wegbeschreibung zur Wohnung ist sehr gut, wir haben es sofort gefunden. Die Schlüsselübergabe hat super geklappt. Vor der Abreise durften wir sogar unser Gepäck dort deponieren.
Die Wohnung sieht so freundlich aus wie auf den Bildern. Hübsch und einladend eingerichtet. Wir haben uns dort zu Hause gefühlt. Sauber, grosszügig, mit drei abschliessbaren Zimmern mit grossen Betten. In einem Zimmer hat es ein riesiges Bett, in dem 3 Personen schlafen könnten. Ein zusätzliches Bett steht im Wohnzimmer. Das Bad ist etwas klein, aber ok. Es hatte immer warmes Wasser. Die Küche hat alles, was man braucht, auch Gewürze. Und eine „Moca“ (ital. Kaffeemaschine), die super Kaffee macht. Karoline hat uns sogar erlaubt, ihren PC zu benützen. Sie sagte zwar, er sei sehr langsam. Wir fanden ihn nicht langsam. Jedenfalls waren wir sehr froh darüber. Unsere Tagesrouten hatten wir auf einen Stick gespeichert und so mussten wir nicht alle Unterlagen mitschleppen. Jeden Tag haben wir nach dem Wetter geschaut. Und auf „ (Hidden by Airbnb) map“, um rauszufinden, wo genau die einzelnen Strassen sind. 
All in all, together with our friends from Italy, we had a great stay in a great accomodation.
Karoline was very friendly, helpful and reliable. I could contact her at any time and quickly got a response.
The location of the apartment is ideal. Very close to the metro station. Right next to it there is a supermarket, which is open until 23h. With the Tunnelbanan you are immediately in the center, from where everything is easily accessible by public transport. The indication of direction to the apartment is very good, we found it immediately. The key handover worked great. Before leaving Karoline allowed us to deposit our luggage there.
The apartment looks so friedly like the pictures. Pretty and inviting. We felt at home there. Clean, spacious, with three lockable rooms with great beds. One room has a huge bed where 3 people could sleep. An extra bed is in the living room. The bathroom is a bit small, but ok. There was always hot water. The kitchen has everything you need, even spices. And a ""Moca"" (Italian coffee maker), which makes great coffee. Karoline has even allowed us to use her PC. Although she said it is very slow. We didn’t find. Anyway, we were very pleased. We checked our daily routes we had stored on a flash drive, so we did not have to lug all the documents. Every day we looked at the weather.

On second floor, so some steps to negotiate. Main bedroom a bit congested so we moved the cot!  Overall, a very pleasant experience as it was big enough for all of us and we loved Stockholm. Thanks Karoline and Simone."
6829,1041103,7751628,2013-10-01,4346722,Émilie,"My friends and I had a very nice stay in Karoline's flat : it is really lovely, clean, spacious, and conveniently located near a metro which could take us to Södermalm in a few minutes and directly to the Central Station. We met Karoline when we arrived before she went on holiday, she's really nice, just as I could figure out through her messages. I highly recommend her place !"
6830,1041103,9053902,2013-12-03,2315147,Charles,"We were two couples staying for a long weeken and we absolutely loved the flat. It was the perfect size, warm, comfy beds and sofa and everything we needed. The hosts daughter met us on arrival and was very helpful and nice. Thy even left free biscuits and apples and bread! Couldn't rate this place high enough. "
6831,1041103,9266075,2013-12-17,9212250,Cora,"Me, my husband, our 18 months old son and my mother in law stayed in Karolines flat for 5 days and it was really gorcious. The flat was clean and  spacious and located close to a supermarket and a metro station only some stops away from Central station.
It is a perfect flat to stay with small childs, there were plenty of lovely toys and everything was adapted for necessities with children (high chair, child-proof locked plug sockets, stepladder for the bathroom...).
Karolines daughter welcomed us very friendly and was always very helpful in case of questions. She even left a ""starter package"" for lunch for us (bred, juice...). Would definitely and maybe will come back to this place! Thanks a lot!
"
6832,1041103,9874574,2014-01-16,7400325,Simone,"Me and my parents stayed in this spacious and cozy apartment for 5 nights. We really enjoyed it. There's everything you'd need. There are three bedrooms, each with a comfortable and large bed. There is a big living with two sofas, one of them is a sofa bed. There are also a lot of toys, so, if you have kids with you (we received the visit of our swedish grandchilds/nephews), they can  have some fun in playing with them. Furthermore, Karoline and her kind daughter Simone provide us everything we needed for the breakfast. About the area where the flat is located (Aspudden/Hägerstensvägen): it's very handy and convenient...you have the Tunnelbana (Stockholm's subway) very close to the apartment, only 3 minutes by foot and there are also some shops/cafe's/restaurants where you can do some grocery shopping or drink/eat something. All in all, I'd definitely recommend this apartment to other guests! :)"
6833,1041103,10031642,2014-01-27,9439447,Fokko,"All fine, we enjoy our days in the Appartement. Rooms are large enought, but not really space for the clothes. But for staying only a few days, it was ok. 
Nice big living room, perfect the near to the Underground.
Contact to Karoline and her daughter was good.
All in all, we would book again, if we will stay in Stockholm another time."
6834,1041103,12123697,2014-04-23,13172834,Victoria,"Wonderful place, wonderful clean and peaceful neighbourhood. We really loved our stay, the apartment is beautiful and Karoline kindly allowed us to borrow her son's toys and buggy, which was great. The only minor suggestions I would have would be to leave a hairdryer for guests, if possible, and we also found it hard to sleep at night as the curtains are so light! But overall we had a wonderful stay and would definitely come back. Thank you. "
6835,1041103,12662293,2014-05-07,13800228,Patrick,"Our stay was very nice. The apartment matches perfectly with the description made. It is very nice and well located. 
Our host was very attentive and it was easy to communicate with her during the preparation of our trip. "
6836,1041103,13812275,2014-06-05,6142596,Daniel,"This was a great place to spend couple of days in Stockholm, with nice access to transportation via metro line and bus. Neighbourhood was quiet, with a supermarket nearby, and 15 minutes from the city center. The apartment was exactly as described, fairly clean with a fully functional kitchen, wireless internet, etc. The only things missing was actually a hair dryer (might be a problem in the winter) and microwawe oven (which isn't healthy after all). Some might say it was a little bit cluttered with stuff, but that's what you would expect from a place where a whole family lives when there are no guests. This can even add to the feeling of being home in a foreign city.

Our hosts, Karoline and his husband were great, they welcomed us when we arrived quite late and was happy to help when we required some assistance.

Overall this place is great for a couple of people heading to Stockholm for a congress (like our party), or for a family looking to spend some time in this nice city."
6837,1041103,15899983,2014-07-18,9803847,Pamela,"Everything was what we expected, and the hosts were very friendly,leaving  us food to get started, after a very trying and tiring airline experience."

6839,1041103,19864886,2014-09-20,12550743,Jackie,"My girlfriends and I had a wonderful stay at Karoline's apartment. It was spacious, clean and situated 3 minutes from the metro which was very important to us. We didn't need her often after we got settled in but on the two occasions that we did request something she immediately responded in a helpful manner. The beds were comfortable and the kitchen though small by our standards produced some great meals. I would say that the only downside at all might have been the noise. It is situated on a busy street and since the weather was so amazing while we were there we left the windows open allowing the street noise to come in, though that wasn't really a problem at all. The neighbor hood was very nice too. We would definitely stay there again! "
6840,1041103,25495454,2015-01-18,7400325,Simone,"It was the second time I stayed in Karoline's apartment, together with my family. I can confirm all I wrote in my previous feedback. Karoline is a perfect host and her apartment is comfortable, clean and practical. I really appreciated her helpfulness towards us. I'd surely recommend her apartment to other guests! :)"

Karoline and her husband were very accommodating and always at hand if we needed anything. Can really recommend staying there!

6843,1041103,276903426,2018-06-15,3843110,Jodie-Lee,"Karoline’s place was exactly what I needed for this two week work trip. It was very comfortable, I could work late every night, get the subway home even at 11pm, and come in without disturbing Karoline and her son as they sleep at the other end of the apartment. The subway, along with a good sized supermarket and a few shops, is a 2 minute walk away. Karoline was very accommodating and kind. I LOVED my time in Sweden and was so glad I didn’t stay in the old town with the rest of the tourists! I felt like I got to see a more authentic side of Sweden this way. Thanks Karoline!"
6844,1041103,281107342,2018-06-24,1872424,Gabriel,Karoline is very hospitable and her apartment is conveniently located  right next to the metro.

6857,1041103,445859297,2019-04-30,17633135,Béatrice,"I stayed 1 month at Karoline's. The flat is very clean and cosy. Regarding the bedroom it's very light that is nice but if you need dark to sleep you won't manage. She tried her best to create instaneneous curtains for me tho. Karoline is very reactive when you need something. 
She lives with her son and they wake up very early in the morning (around 6am). They always try to be discrete but there is no door in the living room so you listen to the TV every time it is on. So if you are a morning person there is no problem but if you are not you might be waken up if you have a light sleep. There is also no micro wave so if you are a lazy cooker it's not easy. 
The flat is well located in a calm district not far from the center and it's quite cute. I would definitely recommend it if you want to stay for few weeks as rents in Stockholm used to be very high and there is no so much flats to book."
6858,1041103,451228290,2019-05-11,47344092,Fifi,"Karoline's place is incredibly nearing to the station, it's very convenient, and there is a local supermarket just around that area as well. The bedroom is clean, everything is great. She respond any messages always quick, and love to help. If I would have a chance visit Stockholm again would love to stay in her place again :)"

6860,1041103,464641080,2019-06-06,237429362,Alexandre,"Karoline lives in a very cozy flat, close to a subway station, with a few cafes nearby and even a supermarket. It’s very easy to get downtown - about 20 minutes you’re in T Centralen and Gamla Stan. She was very welcoming, very nice and whenever I had a doubt she helped me out. I loved my experience there!"
6861,1041103,471870540,2019-06-18,181474554,Martina,"Great place to stay, very close to subway and supermarket. I highly recommend it. Bring a sleeping mask if you're going in summer ;)"

6869,1048260,9255867,2013-12-16,2598168,Lena,"I had a great stay at Annikas place. The location was perfect. Close to the subway and the city. The apartment was cosy and I felt right at home. Annika was a really sweat host and I felt very welcomed in her home. If you'd like an harmonic place, close to the city, with an eastern touch, this is the place to stay at. "
6870,1048260,12376679,2014-04-30,704635,Patricia,"Annikas place is very authentic and personal and I felt at home right away, - which had to do with Annikas nice welcome, but also with the flat itself. The kitchen is small but efficient and very bright, the bathroom is likely, and very cosy in a way, or just with a feminine touch to it. The bedroom has some windows with a very calming view onto trees, bushes and some houses, which are covered by the plants, so you feel safe and unseen. There are shutters to make it darker, - although it stayed quite bright, so bring a sleepmask, if you're sensitive towards light. The little balcony was pleasant sunny in the late afternoon. - I enjoyed my stay at Annika's very much. And i would come back in future."
6871,1048260,12949535,2014-05-15,12007762,Sophie,"Annika's apartment is beautiful and inspiring, very much like the person i'm sure she is ! We didn't meet in person, but she was really sweet and helpful in all the contacts we had.
When i was in Stockholm the weather was not very good, but it wasn't a problem because i had such a nice place to stay. The bed is comfortable and the neighbourhood is very quiet ; but more than that, it is definitely true the place has great energy. 
Staying in Annika's apartment made my trip to Stockholm unique ! Loved it !"

She made everything easy for me and gave me clear instructions of how to get to her place. The flat is very nice and cosy, comfortable, clean and wellcoming, it felt like home. A real treat after your day in busy Estockholm in summer. The location is good, only 4 metro stops from the city centre, really quick and easy. I would recommend Annika's flat to anybody and I would, certainly, take it again if I go back to Stockholm. Thank you very much, Annika."
6874,1048260,17678564,2014-08-16,15291833,Mélodie,"We really had a great time at Annika's place ! we didn't meet in person, but she made everything to make us feel welcome in her home. Nice location (subway is 5 minutes from home and then you're 2 stations from sodermalm and less than 10 minutes to T Centralen), really nice balcony and everything you might need (especially if you are self catering)."
6875,1048260,32416658,2015-05-17,9645308,Rachel,"Annika has a really nice appartment, in the South of Stockholm. Although we did not met she was very helpfull in answering questions & providing me with all the info needed. Because it was good whether I used the bike a lot to go into Sodermalm & the city center. The metro station is a 10 min. walk. Thanks for a great stay, I really felt at home!"

The apartment has a lot of character, had lots of natural light and beautiful plants.  Annika was very helpful and gave us a list of recommendations of things to do in Stockholm and places to eat - all of which were great suggestions. The apartment is a short walk from the metro so was very convenient. It was a great place to stay and I would recommend it.  
Thanks for having us! "

We ended up arriving several hours late due to delayed flights, and she was very accommodating with our travel issues and letting us know how to get the keys. The flat itself is really nice - beautifully decorated, clean, and cozy. The location was perfect - just a ten minute (or less) walk from the train station on the most central train line, making it easy to get to anywhere in Stockholm. The flat was also very quiet. I would definitely recommend staying here!"

Le logement est confortable, douillet et propre. Il est plein d'ondes positives, très zen et avec une belle décoration et des plantes. Il y a un salon avec un matelas confortable au sol, avec un balcon au calme. La cuisine est pratique, avec frigo, gazinière, petite cafetière Bodum et bouilloire. On peut manger dans la cuisine sur la table basse. La petite salle de beau contient une baignoire, un lavabo et un WC. Il y a Internet Wifi et chaine Hifi.
Le logement est au calme, ce qui est très agréable. La ligne de métro est à moins de 10 minutes à pied, les salles de concert Globen et Tele2Arena sont  à 10 minutes à pied. C'est très bien pour visiter Stockholm.
On peut faire ses courses juste en face à l'épicerie Tempo (un peu cher), sinon au ICA du centre commercial Globen (10 min).
Je remercie Annika pour sa confiance, son hospitalité et ses précieux conseils, même si nous n'avons pas eu la chance de nous voir, nous avons communiqué par message."

It's located in a quiet neighborhood, but very convenient to public transportation. It took me maybe 8-10 minutes to walk to the Gullmarsplan station, and only about 5-8 minutes to take the metro to Södermalm or Gamla Stan... so I was in all the best parts of town within 15 minutes of my doorstep. It was very easy to communicate with Annika when I had questions, and she is very warm and welcoming. I highly recommend her place to anyone visiting Stockholm! "

The apartment is well located, only a few stops from the city center ! The place was really cosy.

L'ambiance bohème est très agréable pour se ressourcer et profiter pleinement de Stockholm, Annika est une hôte sympa qui nous a donné les informations nécessaires sur l'appartement et invité à profiter des produits comme les épices, le miel, le café et le thé ( tous des produits de qualité). Nous recommandons fortement cette hôte pour profiter de la vie suédoise. "

6891,1048260,123900875,2016-12-31,95721437,Helen,"I defiantly recommend staying at Annika's flat.

Annika's flat is a wonderful space with fantastic decoration. It was also perfectly clean and it was a pleasure to cook in the kitchen which has everything you need. 

The flat is very near an underground station which is two stops from city centre and so we found it very convenient for exploring Stockholm from.

The best thing about staying at Annika's was the tips she's gave us about what to do in Stockholm - we would never have known about Hellasgarden without her advice!

Annika's flat is excellent value for money, she replies to all messages very fast and is very friendly and her flat feels like a home away from home!

Thank you Annika!

Wenn man etwas Zeit und Lust hat, kann man auch bequem laufen. Supermarkt und Restaurants sind direkt um die Ecke. Die Wohnung ist individuell eingerichtet und dadurch sehr wohnlich.

6918,1048260,368855243,2019-01-08,120690916,Maria,"One of the best BnBs I've ever stayed at. I would love to live like this. 

Everything as described in other reviews. It was spacious, airy and comfortable for me as a solo traveler.

No lift, you sit on floor cushions at a table, gas cooker and futon on the floor.  If this is all fine for you, you'll have a great stay. 

It's an older building, so it's a bit cold, despite the heater (in winter). It want a problem for me, I brought very warm clothing. 

In loved all the little touches, the plants and that everything was second hand, fair or sustainably produced. It was a great place to destress from a difficult 2018... good location, close to public transport with fast and frequent connections. Close to the city.  Small store opposite the house. Quiet most of the time.

Would come back in a heartbeat.

Annika is a lovely, warm and welcoming host. She answered any query very quickly. Thank you Annika!!!"
6919,1048260,417210558,2019-02-26,86089298,Verena,"Annika's cozy apartment is perfect for visiting Stockholm thanks to its proximity (7 minute walk) to the underground station from where you can take the underground to the city's old town and its center (which takes about 10-15 minutes).

There's a small balcony that we took coffee and breakfast (some muesli that she herself provided!) on each day that wasn't raining. All linen was provided. A laundry room in the basement so we were able to wash our clothes before leaving for our next location. 
The only thing I would mention - although not really a negative, was there was no TV"

The place was cosy and clean with ample space for 2 people. It was also very conveniently located, within walking distances to Metro stations and minutes away from all the main sites like Gamla Stan, Woodland Cemetery, Drottnngholm..etc.. As someone else had mentioned in their review the double bed was very comfortable. Also Melissa left us some maps, brochures and her own information sheet about her favourite restaurants, cafes and walks; a lovely personal touch. A very good experience.

She showed trust and left us with space for us to feel at ease. She was kind enough to leave valuable information about the neighbourhood on the kitchen table and even had food for our first breakfasts. We enjoyed the quiet neighbourhood with public transports (bus and t-banna) very close by. The t-banna line is the red one which takes you right to Hornstull. Mariatorget, Slussen, Gamla Stan, etc. Also very near to at least one small playground (walking distance). The apartment was great for the two people and a toddler and as a lot of light.

6956,1048668,181186421,2017-08-12,35995385,Magda,"We enjoyed staying at Malissa's place. It was comfortable, very clean, tidy, well-organized and nicely decorated. The bed was very comfortable. Our daughter slept on the couch with bedding provided. There was enough space for the 3 of us. The kitchen was well-equipped, though we only used it for making breakfast. Here a little disappointment since the description and many guests mentioned breakfast being provided: Maybe Melissa was in a rush and couldn't provide it for us because we found only some cheese and jam in the fridge. Hosts usually don't provide food, so that was fine and we made our own breakfast. Melissa communicated with us via email and texts and did it very promptly and gave good advice and directions how to get to her apartment and the airport. We also used her recommendations for local restaurants. We visited the same restaurant twice because the food was very good. We wanted to try traditional Swedish food and the place that offered potato dumplings and meatballs was great. Thank you for recommending it, Melissa! The apartment is located in a quiet residential area with many small apartment houses in natural looking landscape. We walked to both T stations (about 700 m, under 10 min walk) when traveling to the center for sightseeing, and took a bus from right outside the apartment when traveling with luggage. We wish we had stayed longer to explore the area near the apartment for all the attractions Melissa mentioned. We had a pleasant stay and recommend Melissa's place to other visitors to Stockholm."

Melissa gave us tips for nice Cafes and Restaurant in the local neighborhood and the city center is easily reached by subway. Melissa left us coffee, bread and marmalade for breakfast. Even though we didn't meet her the communication was good and she answered our questions immediately. If you are into movies, arts and cactuses - this is a place for you :-)"

Vår vistelse var fantastisk!"
6970,1054406,43057819,2015-08-17,36129719,Johan,Vi bodde hos Thomas en vecka i augusti. Vi fick ett mycket bra välkomnade både inför ankomsten och på plats. Boendet kändes fräscht och välplanerat och allt man behöver fanns på plats. Läget är mycket lugnt och närheten till Långsjön var en stor fördel för oss eftersom det var så fint väder. 
6971,1054406,43947634,2015-08-23,35956642,Jakob,Thomas was a great host. The place was nice and clean.

6973,1054406,74929305,2016-05-17,62687973,Þór,"The beautiful apartment and it's surroundings had a lot to do with how wonderful our stay in Stockholm was over Eurovision week 2016. And Tomas's and Madeline's kindness and helpfulness made us feel so welcom from the get go.

We decited to skip the puplic transport for traveling around and rented a car. That is a great way to travel around the Stockholm area (but be mindful that parking laws in Stockholm are quite confuzing and quite a jungle to go through). But what made our decision to go with a rental even better was that T and M gave us keys to their bicycles so we had the option to ride the bikes to town (real easy and so much fun in the Stockholm sun) and around the beautiful lake (so romantic and nice - and you can swim in it).

The apartment is wonderful - so much nicer than the pictures show "

The basement appartment is well set up and even contains a jacuzzi.  There was ample space for us and the 3 small children.  The environment is very child friendly, with a small garden and even a trampoline to use.  
Supermarket in the immediate area."
6976,1054406,78395937,2016-06-06,74640603,Silvio S,Thomas is a great host who always made sure I had everything needed. He even stayed awake until 1am to make sure we arrive safely after a flight delay! I can only recommend staying at his place and I would definitely book with him again!
6977,1054406,80258285,2016-06-17,2845659,Swati,"Thomas and Madeleine are absolutely fantastic hosts! They were very responsive and provided us with all the information we needed to enjoy our stay in Stockholm. The apartment is really nice (looks better in person than the pictures), spacious, and was very comfortable for our group of 6 adults. We drove up to their place and there is parking right outside the apartment. It is also very close to a beautiful lake with walking/bike trails. We were traveling with our parents and Thomas and Madeleine were so kind as to get us a SL access card for our trip to the city. The bus stop is a 5 minute walk to the train station, which is a short ride away from the city center. They periodically kept checking in to ensure that our stay in Stockholm was both enjoyable and very comfortable. I would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Stockholm. Thanks Thomas, Madeleine!"
6978,1054406,81112966,2016-06-21,35046670,Sharad,"Thomas instantly obliged us by picking us up in his car. 
Well that was enough for me to understand his hospitality. 
He clearly explained us nearby places on the way also helped us with bus and train routes. 
The place itself is cosy , clean , & comfortable. 
More so we we were amazed at the connectivity this place had to the city centre as it was not only convenient but also fast.  
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

6979,1054406,83691237,2016-07-04,6047202,Ronelle,"A wonderful apartment under Thomas and Madelyn's house. It had everything we needed, including a jacuzzi type bath tub that the kids loved. Although quite far out of town, the transport links are excellent, taking about 35 mins to reach central station. Be sure to get a preloaded SL ttansport card before you arrive at the house, or install the SL app and get a prepaid data SIM. The coop at Fruängen is reasonably priced and has everything. The hosts went out of their way to accommodate us, and we could not ask for more. Also, nice lamp shades."
6980,1054406,87886087,2016-07-22,80762794,Tone Elise,"The place was just perfect! In the middle of everything for both parents and tweens. Just few metres to a refreshing bath in the lake or 15 minutes by subway to city center. The apartment had everything we needed, including outdoor furniture for relaxing time in the sun. And not to mention those incredible serviceminded hosts! Thank you so much Thomas and Madeline, we really enjoyed our stay!"
6981,1054406,90781343,2016-08-02,7776692,Amanda & Suria,"Thomas nous a apporté toutes les informations et conseils nécessaires à notre arrivée. Malgré leur absence, l'entrée dans les lieux a été très facile grâce à une porte à code très simple d'utilisation. Pas de souci de clé. Le quartier est très agréable, le petit lac et le parc avec café et pâtisseries juste à côté. C'était très agréable de rentré dans ce havre de paix après une journée de marche en ville. Notre hôte a été très accueillant et nous a même facilité notre départ en nous amenant à la gare avec tous nos bagages. Merci encore! "

Als wir am Bahnhof ankamen, holte uns Thomas mit seinem Auto ab, das ersparte uns eine Busfahrt mit mehreren Koffern. Gleich am ersten Tag gab uns Thomas eine tolle und umfassende Einweisung in die nähere Umgebung des Appartments und die näheren Verkehrsverbindungen. Außerdem ist das Haus in unmittelbarer Nähe zu einem idyllischen See. 
Danke Thomas und Madeleine!"
6983,1054406,95729276,2016-08-20,59935172,Kerstin,"Thomas ist ein guter Gastgeber. Die Wohnung war mit allem Notwendigen ausgestattet.
Die Lage ist gut, es ist eine ruhige Umgebung. 
Zum Badesee sind es nur 100m. 
Es sind 5 Gehminuten bis zur Bushaltestelle. 
Unserer Familie hat es gut gefallen."

Wir waren sehr beeindruckt von Eurer Persönlichkeit und Gastfreundschaft, dem geräumigen Appartement und der traumhaften Lage am See... So ruhig und idyllisch und trotzdem braucht man mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln nicht lange bis in die City. Für unsere Tochter Ida war es der Himmel auf Erden, im Garten zu spielen, Trampolin zu springen und sich mit den Hasen zu beschäftigen!! Es hätte in jeder Hinsicht nicht besser sein können! Alles Liebe! Mark und Tanja"
6985,1054406,102341803,2016-09-17,26245573,Constanze,"We got a warm welcome from Madeleine who showed us around and helped us after a very early flight with coffee and milk. The appartment is well equipped and exactly as Thomas desciption on the airbnb plattform. We had great sunny days in wonderful Stockholm and even the appartment is not placed very central but you can get around easily with the official transport and the lake nearby invites for a morning swim (what we did!). And thank you so much, Thomas, on saturday for the great early chaffeur service to the Airport Shuttle! We definately can recommend a stay in that beatiful area! Hope to come back one day and then we'll show it to out two sons!"

The apartment is very spacious and had everything we needed. There is a beautiful lake and an old, pretty café nearby, all very quiet and relaxing. But it's also quite convenient and quick to get to Stockholm centre.
I would definitely stay there again when I'm in Stockholm."

Thomas is extremely friendly and helpful. Honestly; all in all, our stay was perfect. I would highly recommend staying there! The lake nearby is lovely and it's easy getting to the next bus stop and to the city.
Every time again! :)"

He picked us up from the station even if it was very late, showed us all we need around the house, and also prepared the pizza N beers for us, which we really appreciated. 
The house is located in a nice community, where you can walk to a lake for jogging. The bus stop is also very close. 
Our stay is too short and we will definitely come back again in the near future. We recommend everyone to choose it!"

6996,1054406,143956893,2017-04-14,53447764,Roberto,"Thomas and Madeleine's place was the perfect base for our visit to Stockholm.  The apartment is exactly as you see in the pictures - clean, spacious, and equipped with all the amenities a group or family needs for several days in Stockholm.  The location is just as described...a couple of bus stops within a five minute walk taking you, after a short ride, to direct metro service to the center of Gamla Stan (old town) and Central Station.  Thomas and Madeleine are great hosts.  Communication throughout was great, and they stocked the apartment with some basic groceries to help us get started.   We will definitely be staying there again if we return to Stockholm."
6997,1054406,146222367,2017-04-22,11198427,Elodie,"Nous avons partagé ce logement à 5 (2 couples et un enfant de 4 ans). Logement impeccable, suffisamment équipé pour cuisiner. Petits supermarchés à 5 minutes en bus (il y a aussi un traiteur, un systembolaget pour l'alcool, et une pharmacie).
Pour aller à Stockholm compter 30 minutes mais très facile. Pour ceux qui restent 7 jours ne pas hésiter à prendre la carte SL à la station de métro : 30€/par personne pour les 7 jours ont l'a largement amortie !
Pour notre organisation matinale nous avons apprécié de pouvoir utiliser la douche et la baignoire en même temps (= gain de temps !).
Thomas et Madeleine sont très agréable, ils ont répondu à toutes nos questions et nous ont rendus plusieurs services (prêt de petits outils pour réparer notre poussette ! paracétamol pour notre fille ! accompagnement jusqu'à la gare pour le dernier jour).
Le lac à proximité est très agréable. Le quartier est très calme et pour les plus chanceux.....vous aurez peut être l'occasion de croiser un jeune élan dans le jardin !!! Je crois que c'était assez exceptionnel quand même !"
6998,1054406,148096606,2017-04-30,42607269,Ellen,"We hebben een hele fijne tijd gehad in Stockholm. Thomas en zijn vrouw Madeleine waren ontzettend gastvrij en behulpzaam. het is een heel fijn huis. In 30-40 minuten ben je in Stockholm. Het is makkelijk reizen met een SL kaart die onbeperkt toegang geeft tot bus, metro en trein.
Een aanrader is het fotografiemuseum met een brunch in het restaurant ( vooraf reserveren is aanbevolen). Prachtige locatie, mooi uitzicht voortreffelijke gerechten."
6999,1054406,150475198,2017-05-08,424230,Julia,"This is a lovely apartment, well-equipped, very comfortable and close to a picturesque lake and a charming cafe. Thomas is a friendly and welcoming  host, giving good information, picking us up from the public transport terminal when we arrived and making sure we had a well-stocked fridge. From the apartment, it's easy to get into central Stockholm by bus (3 mins away and very frequent) and then a short train journey. 
Thanks for a great stay!"
7000,1054406,153639369,2017-05-21,62089590,Victoria,"Thomas made us feel very welcome and went above and beyond to ensure we had a good stay in Stockholm. The apartment had everything we needed and the city centre was accessible using public transport. The lake was an added gem as we spent a few sunny evenings having a drink and enjoying the view.
We would really recommend this Air Bnb to any small groups and families as Thomas is a great host and added to our experience of Stockholm. "
7001,1054406,154983469,2017-05-27,37226279,Lianne,"This is a wonderful, clean and very well equipped apartment in a quiet neighbourhood. The host is very friendly and helpful!

7003,1054406,157906845,2017-06-05,110403500,George,"We had a truly wonderful stay at Thomas and Madeleine's lovely apartment. They are a charming, warm, friendly, and engaging couple who make you feel very much at home. They are also extremely discreet and respectful people. They take the time to meet you and get to know you. That makes a trip a little special. We were extremely gratified to arrive at the apartment with a very well stocked larder and fridge. During our four day stay there was very little we needed to buy in the way of provisions, which was a real bonus and very much appreciated. We received immediate replies on the few queries we raised. I even got a weather update and words of support from Thomas the day before I ran in the Stockholm Marathon, which again was much appreciated. 
The apartment is in an idyllic location, being located near a beautiful lake, with an historic cafe/restaurant just a few minutes walk away. There is also another cafe located by the lake just 15 minutes walk away. The lake is definitely worth a walk/jog around. The bus stop is just a few minutes walk away, with the buses running frequently to Fruängen metro station. The walk to the station is pleasant and takes around 20-25 minutes. So you can definitely get to the centre of Stockholm in 30-40 minutes. 
We were a party of 4 and were accommodated comfortably.
We can't recommend this lovely apartment enough."

The apartment itself was very comfortable and the kitchen very well equipped to prepare a few home cooked meals.

The apartment is exactly as described (and suoer clean) and they welcomed us with a food package!  You will find basics like pepper, salt, vinegar,... in the kitchen. The apartment offers a lot of space and there is also a table to sit outside. We used the public transport to go to Stockholm, which was very easy. 

You should go to the little cafe in walking distance - it is very nice! 

Thanks Thomas and Madeleine for having us! "

Leiligheten ligger i et rolig og barnevennlig nabolag og det var enkelt å komme seg til å fra sentrum av Stockholm med offentlig transport . Vi følte oss veldig velkommen når Thomas hadde kjøpt inn litt mat og brukte tid til å vise oss rundt i nabolaget når vi kom.

The appartment was very equipped. The owners even did some groceries. Very nice!"
7013,1054406,182130507,2017-08-14,97282786,Claudius & Friederike,"We had a wonderful stay in Thomas' quiet and really large apartement. The Check-In was easy, although Thomas couldn't be there and we didn't know the exact time of our arrival. We found the flat clean and with all we could have wished for: wifi, sheets&towels and a fully equiped citchen (besides a dishwater, but that wasn't a problem at all). The bathroom is massive and even includes a washing machine. To the next bus station it's a five minutes walk, to tram about 20 minutes. In about 40min you are at Stockholms Zentral Station. We really enjoyed on the one hand the calm and pretty neighbourhood and on the other hand the really good and fast connection to the city centre. We would enjoy coming back one day to this marvelous city and this nice flat. Tack!"

L'appartement est grand et très fonctionnel. La literie est bonne et les rangements suffisants. Le bus a 5min à pied (chrono) passe toutes les 10min de 7 à 9h et des 17h, puis toutes les 30min. Il emmène au métro en moins de 10min qui est très fréquent. L'appartement est très bien desservi par les transports, même si on aimerait y arriver plus vite après une grosse journée de visite. Compter 45min du centre, porte à porte. 
Nous reviendrons !"

Die Lage der Wohnung unmittelbar in der Nähe eines Sees mit Badestelle ist ein Traum. Man kann zu jeder Zeit ein kühles Bad nehmen. 
Die Nachbarschaft ist sehr angenehm und leise. 
Der ÖPNV ist perfekt an diesem Standort, die Taktung des Buses liegt zwischen 10 und 30 Minuten, nahezu rund um die Uhr. Das gilt auch an Wochenenden und Abends (30 Minutentakt). Es gibt immer Anschluss am S-Bahn Bahnhof (hier auch ein guter coop Supermarkt vorhanden! Lidl ist ca. 3 km von der Wohnung entfernt.
Die Wohnung ist sehr sauber und ordentlich und vollständig eingerichtet. 
Der Kühlschrank war sogar mit einem Starterkit gefüllt inkl. Brötchen. 
Madeleine und Thomas haben unseren Aufenthalt zu einem perfekten Ereignis gemacht. Unsere Kinder (beide 11) haben sich sehr über die Möglichkeit gefreut die Hasen füttern zu dürfen. 
Ich kann es nur allen empfehlen hier zu buchen."

You have the 1st floor of your own while the host's family live on the 2-3 floor, yet you get good privacy with your own door access and parking space.  Cafe nearby is very cute, something not to be missed.  We enjoyed our stay very much.
Bathroom is not well constructed as the floor will get wet if you use the standing showet.  Its ok when using the bathtub."

Several bus stops nearby make it relatively easy to get into the city. Closer to the apartment, we also enjoyed the playground and lake. The personal touches were also lovely - Thomas offered it let us check in early and stay late to accommodate our travel plans, there were groceries waiting for us in the kitchen, and Madeline lent us puzzles for our son. Definitely recommended!"

Een auto is aan te bevelen, hoewel de bushalte circa 5 minuten lopen van het appartement verwijderd is. Er zijn 2 slaapkamers; slapen in de huiskamer kan ook. Thomas heeft nog 2 extra opklapbedden. 
Voor ons was het een prima locatie (verbleven met 4 collega's voor een beurs)"
7023,1054406,253106602,2018-04-13,94645301,Rasmus,"We stayed in Thomas apartment during a job at Stockholmsmässan. It was a really nice apartment with everything you needed in a nice calm area. The lake made a perfect scene for a morning run and the inner city of Stockholm was only 15 minutes away by car, when we were going out to eat in the evening.

I would surely recommend the apartment for others - especially if you need to be near Stockholmsmässan."

Gute Kommunikation und Beschreibung von Thomas haben uns die Ankunft erleichtert. Wir wurden sogar vom und am Ende zum Bahnhof per Auto abgeholt bzw. gebracht. Top-Service. 

Unterkunft und Lage: Sieht aus wie auf den Bildern. Sehr grosszügig geschnitten. Betten für uns sehr bequem und ohne Rückenschmerzen. Alles vorhanden. Inkl. Geschirrspüler und Waschmaschine. Zu unserer Überraschung war der Kühlschrank gefüllt mit Bier, Wein, Wasser, Saft, Milch, Schoki, Butter, Käse, Schinken und zudem noch Brot, Nudeln und Müsli (letzteres glaube ich von Vorgängern). Top-Service. 
Gutes Wlan auch mit 4 Geräten gleichzeitig. 

In 3 Minuten ist man an eine idyllischen See, alte Apfelbäume wurden zum Klettern benutzt und ein uriges Cafe lud zum Pausieren ein. In 17 Minuten zu Fuss ist ein gut ausgestatter Supermarkt. 4 Geh-Minuten zur Bushaltestelle nach Fruängen und Älvsjo. Wir sind immer nach Fruängen gefahren, dort im Supermarkt Proviant besorgt und dann mit der Bahn nach Stockholm City. Rückweg das umgekehrte Programm inkl. Einkauf. Am besten schon am Flughafen bei der Ankunft SL Karten (je 20Kr) kaufen, dann 72-Stunden- oder wie wir Wochenkarte kaufen. Spart Geld.


Etwas Negatives gab es für uns nicht. Wir haben uns „fast“ wie zu Hause gefühlt. ;)"

Direkt nebenan ist ein wunderschöner Badesee und ein tolles schwedisches Café. Spielplätze sind auch in der Nähe. Die Bus und Bahnverbindung sind sehr gut. Innerhalb von 30 Minuten ist man in Gamla Stan (Altstadt). 
Wir können die Unterkunft wärmstens empfehlen und würden jederzeit wiederkommen!"
7026,1054406,277410560,2018-06-16,165346186,Karin,"Thomas and Madleine were very nice, curing and helpful hosts. The communication was uncomplicated, the answers very fast. The location of the apartment was very good. We could do everything with public transport. Parking spaces were available for the cars. We felt comfortable in this apartment."
7027,1054406,280487400,2018-06-23,178811382,Maria,"Мы останавливались у Томаса на неделю с двумя детьми. Нам все очень понравилось, начиная с того как нас встретили - Томас разрешил нам приехать раньше времени, указанного на сайте, купил нам немного еды, чтобы мы могли перекусить с дороги, все рассказал и показал все самые необходимые вещи  - где находится автобусная остановка, магазин, кафе, более того Томас отвез нас в магазин на своей машине и мы смогли купить на неделю еды. Для младшего сына (2 года) Томас принес нам детский стульчик, игрушки и мячик, показал нам своих кроликов и разрешил их кормить, чему был очень рад мой сынишка.
Сам апартамент отличный, просторный и уютный. Расположен в 5 минутах до автобусной остановки. До центра можно легко добраться 5 остановок на автобусе и еще 10 остановок на метро по прямой.
Думали перед приездом, что возможно нужно будет пользоваться такси, однако городской транспорт очень удобен, так что даже не воспользовались!
Место чудесное, потому что живешь в городе Стокгольме, но в доме и ощущение, что находишься далеко от города! Место тихое, спокойное и красивое. Рядом большое озеро.
Рекомендую!!!"

7029,1054406,293311141,2018-07-20,86477815,Ricco,"Wij hebben Thomas’ Airbnb zes nachten gehuurd voor ons eerste vakantie in Zweden.

Wij ontvingen onderweg aardige berichtjes, en de verrassing dat er wat kleine boodschappen waren gehaald. Zo was er vers brood, boter, melk, bier, yoghurt, limonade en wat ijsjes. Echt heel aardig en super handig voor de eerste avond en ochtend.

Mijn vrouw, twee volwassen kinderen en ikzelf, vonden ons verblijf een groot succes.
Het is namelijk een schoon, opgeruimd, net, ruim, koel, prettig ingedeeld appartement.Precies zoals de foto’s en de beschrijving op de site vertellen. 

Twee ruime slaapkamers, een ruime badkamer met douche, bad, toilet en wasmachine. Verder is er een ruime woonkamer met open keuken en een prima eetgedeelte.

We hebben een aantal keer gekookt. En als wat je nodig hebt om te koken, is aanwezig. Onze dochter wilde wat strijken, en er is zelfs een strijkijzer.

Ook vonden wij het fijn dat dit een echt gastenverblijf is, dat goed afgesloten en gescheiden is van de privé woning van Thomas’ gezin. Extra verrassing was dat we de privé tuin en terras ook mochten gebruiken. Thomas was zelf een weekje weg, maar kon binnen drie kwartier terug rijden als dat nodig zou zijn.

Al met al een echte aanrader."

The apartment is beautiful and very convenient. Based on Thomas's suggestion, I was running around the lake and enjoyed it very much :).
Getting to the metro station requires a ~20min (beautiful) walk, or using a bus. 
All in all, we had such a great time and were amazed by how beautiful the city is.
Thomas was very responsive and helped with every question we had."

The flat is very clean and you can reach the city with puplic transportation in about 40 minutes. The flat is perfect if you like to have swedish nature and lifestyle in combination with citylife, because there is also a wonderful lake next to the sea. The communication with Thomas was always perfect. We had nothing to complain about."

The apartment was clean, spacious and private. Thomas was a superhost, providing great local tips and even drove us to a local store to buy groceries on our first night. There was a lovely surprise of bread, juice, milk and lots of other little extras waiting for us and Thomas even let my daughter feed his pet rabbits. Can not recommend this place more. Easy transport into Stockholm and the lake was beautiful for a morning walk. Was wonderful. We would love to come back one day."
7041,1054406,367193333,2019-01-04,185703905,Ashley,Really lovely space. Thomas greeted us upon arrival and also allowed for early check-in and late check-out given flights. He even stocked the refrigerator with a few items. The house itself was large and could easily fit far more than the two people who stayed there.

Het appartement heeft goede voorzieningen: complete keuken, lekkere bedden, goede douche, buiten zitje. Het enige minpuntje vonden wij dat de woonkamer vrij donker is. 
Thomas en Madeleine zijn zeer behulpzaam en reageren snel op vragen. 
We hebben een topweek gehad!"

Check-in was a breeze, and upon arrival, we were greeted with a cute sign and several food staples in the fridge. When we had questions, Thomas responded almost as soon as I’d sent the message. The location is lovely, quiet and peaceful, with a lake nearby, and easy access to the bus. Our family of five felt right at home here, and we hope to stay here again if we return to the Stockholm area."

Thomas ist ein sehr umgänglicher und fürsorglicher Gastgeber. Ich fand sogar einen Kühlschrank vor, der zum Teil gefüllt war, damit wir am Anreisetag nicht gleich einkaufen mussten. 
Bis zur U-Bahn sind es zwar 1,6 km, es gibt aber eine gute Busverbindung dorthin. Bus, U-Bahn und Fähren sind im SL-Verbund zusammengeschlossen. Sehr gut sind Mehrtagestickets für alle öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel im SL-Verbund. Die dazugehörigen aufzuladenden Checkkarten hatte Thomas uns bereits in die Wohnung gelegt. 
Die Unterkunft ist sehr zu empfehlen! Detlef"

La zona es muy bonita y se llega rápidamente al centro de Estocolmo con el bus 144, y luego en metro o en tren.  Merece la pena hacer este trayecto para descansar, después de recorrer Estocolmo,  en esta zona rodeada de naturaleza,  muy tranquila y con un lago cercano. 
Thomas responde rápidamente a todas las dudas y preguntas.
La casa está limpia,  es muy agradable y no falta de nada. 
Incluso te deja el frigorífico y la despensa con comida y bebida; lo cual nos ayudó mucho en la primera noche. 
Nos hubiera encantado conocer a Thomas para darle las gracias personalmente. 
Lo recomendamos 100 por 100."

Es besteht aus drei Räumen und liegt parterre. Man kann direkt vor der Tür parken! Die Unterkunft befindet sich in einer ruhigen Einfamilienhausgegend und liegt in der Nähe des Sees Långsjön. Mit Pkw ist man in 15Min Downtown (Gamla Stan/Schloss),sehr guter ÖPNV ist aber auch vorhanden (Selbst die Stammkarten werden von Thomas gestellt!!).

The cot was very comfortable and our little boy slept well. Thomas was an excellent host. He met us at the bus stop to show us to the apartment, made us feel very welcome and left a lot of groceries in the fridge, which was very much appreciated. The centre of Stockholm is easily accessible by public transport. I would highly recommend this apartment (and Stockholm in general) to anyone travelling with children."

Hilfreiche Tipps vom netten Gastgeber sowie 2 Karten für die Bahn zum Aufladen.
Nette Aufmerksamkeit des Gastgebers, dass ein kleines ""Essenspaket"" (Brötchen, Gurke, Bier, etc.) bei der Anreise zur Verfügung gestellt wurde.

Empfehlenswert!"
7067,1096827,4484558,2013-05-07,6140634,Johanna,"The stay at Anitas place was really nice. We had the whole flat (which was like in the pictures - charming interior, spacious, nice neighbourhood and clean) for ourselves because Anita herself wasn't there. But her neighbour took care of us, showed us the flat and gave us some tips for the surroundings and about Stockhom. 
The flat is really close to a subway which is going every 10 minutes and takes just a short ride to the important places in Stockholm.
All in all it was a very nice stay!"

The metro is just about 5min from the apartment and takes you into the city every 10min. There is also a supermarket and a pharmacy nearby.
Anita is a great hostess, we had the pleasure to meet her and talk a bit. She even left us some food in the fridge. Overall we had a great stay and enjoyed the time at Anitas place."
7071,1096827,5963282,2013-07-24,5825478,Lisa,"Anita's place is located outside the centre of Stockholm, but easy to reach by metro. The stop is at the end of the road and trains to the centre run every 10 minutes. There is also a supermarket next to the metro stop and a nice local restaurant downstairs of the house. The apartment itself is lovely: quite big, very light, and cosy. The jacuzzi is amazingly big and perfect for a relaxing evening. You can even play music in the bathroom. The fridge was filled when we arrived, a sign of how kind the hostess herself is. "

Steps away from the metro  (green line 18, stop Sandsborg) that will take you to the central station with plenty of shops and restaurants around if you need it. The apartment itself was spacious and gorgeous. The beds were comfy, two of us stayed in the room and one in the pull out sofa bed. We especially appreciated the awesome stereo system which allowed us to listen to the music throughout the house, including in the bathroom where there is the most amazing Jacuzzi tub I have EVER seen! The area surrounding the apartment was so cute, I wish I would've had more time in the area to experience Enskede! Anita herself was so welcoming and helpful in the planning process as well as patient when I showed up about an hour late due to lost luggage on the plane. I would not hesitate to stay with her again the next time I am in Stockholm! Thank you so much for everything ! Staying here made our time in Stockholm truly special !"

The house is in a very quiet neighbourhood but it's still very easy to access to the city center. The metro line is at 5 min. walk distance and you arrive to the center in ca 15 min. Around the house there is a restaurant, a bakery and big market where you can find everything for the kitchen. 
Anita's house is a clean, big and peaceful place with an excellent decoration. 
So I highly recommend you to book this beautiful house when you are in Stockholm. "

The flat is across the street from a wonderful bakery my sister and I frequented every morning for breakfast and it is also only a 5 minute walk to the metro stop.  Anita herself could not have been more sweet and helpful as she left us some food in her refrigerator and even lent us her bike. I would recommend this flat in an absolute heart beat!"

It is very easy to locate, close to downtown and the surroundings are very agreeable. She's an easily approachable person and was so kind of recommending us a few places to visit in the city. As a nice detail, she left us some food in the fridge.

The living room is great, with a big TV + DVD and a stereo sound-system with turntable, even some assorted CD's. A lot of art books, books about Swedish culture, even an English-Swedish dictionary that was very useful when learning some rudiments of the language. We were very glad of being able to spend time there."

We had a really great time and we would totally recommend her as host! Thank you so much! Tack så mycket!"
7087,1096827,78826504,2016-06-09,3710282,Marcia,"Staying at Anita's place was special treat.  Anita is a superb host.  Her directions were excellent, and she was waiting for us when we arrived to greet us and orient us to the house and the neighborhood.  The apartment is spacious and cozy, light and airy, and very comfortable.  The neighborhood is quiet, but also surrounded by wonderful amenities:  an old-fashioned bakery across the street, an excellent restaurant with outdoor cafe, a convenient market, and easy access to the T Bana.  We were just minutes from Gamla Stan and the city center, but the Gamla Enskede location of her charming flat has the character of a gracious 1900s garden superb.  I'd definitely go back to stay there again on my next trip to Stockholm."
7088,1096827,79713357,2016-06-13,1114558,Jean-Pierre,"L'appartement d'Anita est un appartement ""habité"", pas seulement destiné à la location. Il a une âme au charme suranné. Certains le trouveront peut-être surchargé par rapport aux logements locatifs aseptisés mais moi j'ai adoré. L'appartement est propre.

Je ne vous apprendrez rien en vous disant que Stockholm est dispendieuse (pour un Québécois, en tout cas!), coûte la peau des fesses, comme dirait Victor Hugo... L'option de résider en banlieue est donc intéressante. L'appartement est tout près d'une sortie de métro-train, dans un quartier sécuritaire, avec une épicerie tout près. Peu ou pas de touristes dans le coin et on peut prendre une ballade en toute sécurité le soir, loin des foules, tout en goûtant la paisible vie de banlieue suédoise.

Il y a tout, vraiment tout pour cuisiner (et plus) et Anita nous donne accès à toutes les épices et condiments ou accessoires dans son appartement. De plus, elle nous avait garni le frigo de lait, fromage, saucisson en tranches, yogourt, de quelques fruits et j'en passe.

Quant à l'accueil, il a été des plus chaleureux, sentant qu'elle prenait vraiment à coeur notre séjour et notre bien-être.

À part le lit peut-être un peu étroit et mou, rien à redire.

7089,1096827,81737724,2016-06-24,51188713,Jen,"Anita's flat was beautiful! She was not there when I arrived because we got the dates of my arrival mixed up, but this was no problem. She left the key with her lovely neighbor across the hall. She left out many helpful brochures and even bought some food for me to have in the fridge. Not only that, but her kindness was felt when she called me and gave me advice after I had lost my luggage (and got it back thankfully!) and gotten a migraine from lack of sleep and stress. 

The neighborhood is so cute and pretty, and is right next to the subway. It was easy to get around, a perfect location. I am in love with Stockholm, thank you Anita for hosting me and making this a memorable trip! I would definitely stay with you again."
7090,1096827,83963027,2016-07-04,66215719,Sinping,"The flat is amazing. Cozy, quiet, feeling like home. We appreciate the help from Anita! She left some breakfast for us, and even though we arrived late, she still waited until we got there and gave us some travel advices. Anita is a very lovely and friendly host! The apartment is close to the metro and easy to find. We enjoy our stay very much! Definitely recommend it!"
7091,1096827,85661393,2016-07-12,15820653,Britta,"Anita´s flat is wonderful! It is very spacious, light and the bed is very comfy. The flat is equipped with everything you might need: towels, breakfast, soda stream, scissors, pots, pans, glasses, cutlery, etc. The location of the apartment is also pretty good. It´s a less than 5 minute walk away from the metro station of Sandsborg. The area is very peaceful and relaxed. Very nice neighbours, too! :)
However, the check-in and check-out turned out to be a bit tricky. We chose this place because the check-in and check-out times were listed as ""flexible"". Initially, we booked 4 nights at Anita´s place, but ended up spending only 3 nights because the check-in time (12.30am because our flight got in so late) did not suit the host. We were planning to check out around 4/5pm, but also this time was not suitable. So we ended up checking out in the morning and storing our luggage at Centralstation which costs 90SEK."
7092,1096827,86770212,2016-07-17,67577919,Sharon,"I have just returned from a four night stay in Anita's apartment. The apartment is very bright, spacious, clean and comfortable, it was pleasure to return here after tiring days visiting the sights of Stockholm. We did not meet Anita but she communicated quickly by e-mail giving us very clear directions about how to find the apartment, she also left us food which was very welcome as we arrived quite late.  The apartment is in a very pretty and  quiet area so there was no problem having a good nights sleep -there was no noise from the restaurant downstairs. The apartment is less than five minutes walk from Sansborg T banna which will get you into central Stockholm in about 15 minutes.  This was my first Airbnb experience and I would highly recommend Anita as a host.  "
7093,1096827,91836974,2016-08-06,18557308,Maria,"Anita ha sido muy atenta desde el momento de realizar la reserva hasta el alojamiento en su casa. Su respuesta, siempre muy rápida.

El apartamento es muy amplio y dispone de una cocina muy equipada. El barrio está a 15 minutos en metro de la estación central, en un entorno muy tranquilo. Te mimetizas con la cultura sueca totalmente.

Lo recomendamos, sin lugar a dudas.

7096,1096827,177508080,2017-08-03,10985135,Ruth,"The location is really good (not more than a five minutes walk to the green line) and it is really calm.
The apartment has lots of charm and is cozy. Anita rents out her apartment when she does not live there herself and you can feel her personality with the books, photos, music in her house.
The contact with Anita was warm and friendly. My daughter an I can completely recommend Anita's place."

Le restaurant au rez-de chaussée ne provoque pas de gêne sonore ni olfactive, et on y mange très bien ! Bien que le quartier soit résidentiel voire pavillonnaire, il y a une boulangerie juste en face de la rue."

Es ist alles da, was man braucht, und trotz der Lage etwas außerhalb ist man durch die nahe U-Bahn superschnell im Zentrum. Anita und auch eine Nachbarin, die wir getroffen haben, sind sehr nett und hilfreich bei allen Fragen oder Problemen, die man als Stockholm-Besucher so hat. Wir wollen wieder kommen!"

There is a nice grocery store just down the street and the kitchen was perfect to cook a few meals. The room is clean and nice with a lovely bed and the bathroom was also clean and pleasant. Polina stayed up very late to check me in which was much appreciated. Great stay at a great price!

I got tips on where I could shop for food near the apartment and which restaurants we could eat at. She even got on the subway to pick us up to show the way to the apartment when we arrived. 

The apartment was clean and towels were provided. The bed was big and very good to sleep in. There was no noise even with the window open at night. We cooked and enjoyed ourselves in the apartment and also ate at a chineese restaurant just across the road from the appartment that had good food. Thank you for a very nice stay!

I especially appreciated the fact that the metro station is 5 minutes walk and I could go basically everywhere from there. Unfortunately I haven't met Polina in person but we spoke by messages to arrange my check in and check out and she seems a very nice person and a great host. My arrival was a bit troublesome because I arrived late at night and she was not available at that time, but despite that she accommodated me perfectly and everything went smoothly. A big thumbs up! :)"

We didn't see her, but her friend Magdalena was in the appartement as well when we were there. She waited for us when we arrived late due to flightdelay, which we appreciated greatly. Quite far from city center (+/-45min with bus+/-metro), could have been faster if there was now constructionworks happening at the Metroline. We recommend this appartement for a short cheap stay near Stockholm."

7157,1119738,300931992,2018-08-03,29308103,Mélanie,"Anna is a really friendly and lovely person. I went to her with a friend of mine and we enjoyed staying there. It is a quiet and lovely place. We even got bicycles to drive to the lake wich is near by. My friend and I went to Stockholm to learn a bit the language and culture and Anna helped us to learn these things. We said that we would try to speak swedish with her and so she spoke swedish with us, even slowly so we could understand better. When we had questions we could just go to her. 
I recommend her cordially. "
7158,1119738,307464238,2018-08-14,3387670,Etienne,"Anna is a very nice host, very open to nice and interesting chats that help you understand Sweden a bit better... And her house is a real piece of quietness in the middle of the trees!"

环境很好｡周围都是别墅,花园绿化都很好,我们到了的时候,苹果树硕果累累,地上都是熟透的果子,花园很漂亮｡

房间很干净,床和房间都很舒服,很安静,很舒适｡

房东ANNA很热情,英语很好,很容易沟通｡我们住了3晚,然后飞挪威和冰岛,在斯德哥尔摩买了很多东西,都可以寄存在房东家里,最后一站还是住她家,很方便,很友善｡

强烈推荐,非常喜欢｡"
7162,1119738,330225883,2018-09-30,44806426,Agnes,"Anna's house is situated in a green, quiet and lovely neighboorhood. It is a perfect location to explore Stockholm city and it's surroundings, since the Metro station  is only a few minutes away. Lake Mälaren is also in walking distance,  if you enjoy a walk in the nature. Although Anna was not at home during our stay, she was really quick in answering the questions we had - before and during our stay- and gave us advise on what to do in the area. The house was indeed very cosy. We would definitely come again, should we visit Stockholm again and can highly recommend it to others!"

7167,1119738,468699429,2019-06-13,46942925,Helene,"I went to Stockholm for a work trip, and was forced to find an Airbnb as all hotels in Stockholm were fully booked. Thanks to Anna and her lovely house we had the best stay abroad we've had in years! We almost forgot we came there for work as it felt more like we were on a short holiday... The house is not very close to public transport and shops, but the neighbourhood is absolutely stunning and there is a lovely walk to the waterfront as well. Anna made us feel right at home and is very accommodating. Also, the house feels very cozy and having a separate living room for Airbnb guests is a great way to relax after a full day of work / vacationing. The only downsides to our stay were the very soft beds (our backs hurt a bit) and the small bathroom. Otherwise, 5/5!"

Anna was a friendly and relaxed host and we had nice conversations with her. The apartment was very cosy. We shared the kitchen en the bathroom with Anna, but that wasn't a problem at all. We even could lend bikes and explore the city this way."

7173,1124388,4465867,2013-05-06,5834391,Victor,This was our first experience with Bed and Breakfast stay in Stockholm. We highly appreciated the hospitality and the services provided by our Host was excellent. It was a nice neighborhood and commuting from the apartment to the Stockholm center with bus was easy and quick.
7174,1124388,4690116,2013-05-20,1650067,Gabriel,"The apartment was nice and welcoming even if we were expecting a separated room instead of a tiny separation between the living room and the bed.
The location was good. Just 10-15min away from city center in Bus (Day and Night).
The host was particularly welcoming with good food waiting for us. Thanks again Carl for the apartment. I will definitely recommend this flat for a weekend."

7176,1124388,5150645,2013-06-15,6608496,Blake,"My fiancé and I had such a lovely time in Stockholm while staying at Carl's place. It's located on a really cool little island (30 minutes to casually walk the shoreline path) with some very nice apartments on it, and even some little shops and docks. Everyone there speaks english, (better than many of my friends, in fact), and they are all very helpful. The (#1) bus stop is right around the corner. The place itself is compact, but efficient, warm, and inviting. Carl even has some vinyl records available which truly set the right mood. That was a fun memorable surprise. Would happily visit and stay again! Thanks Carl!"
7177,1124388,5583172,2013-07-07,6629006,Vitaly,"This was first travel for our family (3 person) in Scandinavia and first experience stay in apartment. Carl is very friendly and hospitable host  for travelers . There were nice breakfast, fresh towels and clean apartment, good wi-fi and everything necessary. Great location in quiet place in island. For the little beach we went about  5 minutes, where bath people. Beside apartment locate little supermarket and tai-food, pizza, Indian food, fast-food cafe. About  10-15 min away from apartment to city center in Bus № 1 (Stop called “Cityterminallen”).
We really enjoyed our trip and Stockholm!
Very recommend Carl’s apartment for everybody!

7178,1124388,5744782,2013-07-14,6448822,David,"Had a great stay in Stockholm, and really enjoyed the apartment - had a very homely feel, and very convenient to transport and the middle of town. Carl was a fabulous host who not only emailed us detailed maps of the locations of the relevant bus stops to get there from Central, he also left us some food for breakfast.  Even more, after we left some belongings in the apartment, he met up with us again a few days later to return them! Would highly recommend :)"
7179,1124388,5837995,2013-07-18,5868402,James,"This is a great little apartment on a beautiful island in Stockholm. I have lived in a few different places around the city and this was my favorite. It is a peaceful spot that isn't far outside of the city. The apartment itself has everything you need and the breakfast foods were a nice touch that not many AirBnB hosts throw in. Definitely appreciated. This is a great spot to base your Stockholm adventures out of. You can tour the city, and when you return home you won't feel bad spending lazy time close to home on this super peaceful island. "
7180,1124388,5953818,2013-07-23,5233524,Evgeniya,"My partner and I spent a really lovely weekend in Stockholm staying at Carl's apartment. The place was very cosy, the building clean and nice, the bus stop right outside the door. Carl made us feel very welcome, helped us with directions and was overall an amazing host!
My personal favourites during the stay were the bird feeder on the window and the prettiest ever shower curtain :)"
7181,1124388,5970312,2013-07-24,5238005,Antonia,"I would highly recommend this place. Enough space for three persons. There is a bus - only a one minute walk away - which takes you frequently to the city centre. We only stayed for one night but even though could everything been managed as its best.
Very good communication with the host. 
Tack så jätte mycket!"
7182,1124388,6201152,2013-08-03,7476490,Jean,"Nice little appartement, on a pretty little island.
Everything you need is there, and Carl e-mailed us all the details.
He even let us use a free city bike card (which is a must have in Stockholm). Bikes are available next to the bus stop, cards are sold a little bit further tho.

The island is cool and quiet, you can jogg around it, and even swimm if the water is not too cold!

Too bad we didn't have a chance to meet Carl, but i recommend him as a host, as everything went fine!"
7183,1124388,6327090,2013-08-08,1247626,Alevtina,"It was great time in Stockholm, good location and fine apartment :) perfect place to stay!
Thank you, Carl!"

7185,1124388,6660264,2013-08-20,7312362,Carolina,"The flat is very convenient situated in Stockholm, just 15 minutes bus ride from Main Station. Also night service is provided. The bus stop is nearby, as well as a small grocery shop. We recommend a  walk to the nearby island Kungsholmen along the water and Ralambhovspark.

Carl was very flexible for check-in and chek-out time. We appreciated the fully equipped kitchen with some breakfast items plus possibility to cook our meals in some occasions since we don't always want to eat out. Some minor problem with Bathroom lamp was quickly solved.

We also found his book collection really interesting! Wi-fi worked perfectly.

The bed size was nevertheless a bit on the lower limit. Though, there's an extra bed available, which we didn't use. Bathroom is very compact, typical swedish. Towels were available. 

I highly recommend it for an urban holiday in Stockholm!

7188,1124388,7014781,2013-09-03,7526776,Cameron,"Great little apartment with separate cosy kitchen with dining table and chairs which was nice bonus! Bigger than it looks in the photos.
Very easy to get into town with regular bus service every 5-10mins which ran into early hours or 30 minute walk through parks and along shore front. The bus stop is literally a 20 meter walk from the building entrance and stops right outside the central bus and train station (where the Airport bus drops you off!). 
There is a small supermarket opposite which was well stocked and couple of takeaways. We tried the one a couple of doors down and it was great. 
Carl left us some really nice things for breakfast, including some traditional Swedish break knakebrot which we wouldn't have tried otherwise. Carl was really friendly and a great host. He answered all our questions by e-mail before we arrived and met us to show how things worked and also left left us information about Stockholm and a bike card. "
7189,1124388,7099226,2013-09-06,2710003,Jonathan,Lovely cosy flat in Stockholm with quick transport links to the city centre. We had a fantastic time and really liked the flat. We'd definitely recommend!

7195,1124388,7918544,2013-10-08,238661,Joost,Carl has a nice appartment close to the main bus lines. It's small but it can fit three people (1 couple in the bed + 1 guest on a foldout in the kitchen). We had a great time in Stockholm and Carl's place was a good (and cheap) alternative for a hotel.
7196,1124388,8057162,2013-10-14,5232435,Gaëlle,Very nice and cosy place to stay ! Carl is nice and very welcoming. A place to recommend !

7198,1124388,8254701,2013-10-22,1875384,Christos,"Carl was a very good host. He was waiting for us in his apartment and he gave us every detail that we asked about Stockholm. The room is very close to the center (only 12-15 minutes from central station by bus and the bus station is only a two minutes walk from the house). We had some trouble with one missing towel (only 2 for 3 persons) and some dirty sheets but when I told him, he immediately gave us what we asked. The house is small but good enough if you do not ask for too much. There was a very good music stereo that we enjoined a lot and the kitchen had everything that we wanted to prepare a breakfast. There was a table with 3 chairs and is quite spacious concerning the small house. In 30 meters distance from the house there is a supermarket if you want to buy something to eat in the house. 

P.S.: I you are planning to stay for 3 days or more, please buy the stockholm card. It might be expensive but it is worth it because the public transport is very expensive too. A single ticket costs around 4 euros. With the stockholm card you have unlimited transport and free entrance to the museums."

Carl is really nice : gives you all the information you need with details, food left in the kitchen for us, messages to know if everything is going ok. 
I really recommend this flat if you plan on going to Stockholm!"

We were three and the extra bed was ok. We had a really nice stay at his place, which was very clean and convenient. We took the bus to go to town but we also walked (around 45min) and the path is really nice for those who don't mind.

7207,1124388,10922100,2014-03-13,9216006,Augustus,"Booked Carl's place for a 5 night stay for 3 of us. Carl is an utmost professional to deal with. I got a response to the pre-booking inquiries in a very timely manner. 

Getting to apartment

After the booking Carl sent exact information on how to get to the apartment. He is also reachable on instant messenger ( (Hidden by Airbnb) ) to make the entire check in process smooth as possible. The morning we were to arrive Carl sent an email about the taxis. If you're using one from Arlanda to Carl's place, use the Taxi020 (yellow cabs) and the fixed price is Kr 470 as of the writing of this review. Be weary of cabs in Stockholm as it is a bit of a minefield for tourist really! 

There is also very easy ways to get to the pale via public transport which Carl gives exact information on. BTW entry to the apartment building is via a 4 digit code which Carl will send. Sometimes you need to punch the code over and over for the door to open. It seems pretty normal. We didn't have any issue for the entire duration of the stay.

Apartment and Area

It is just perfect place for a getaway. Located in a small island which is part of Stockholm. There is a grocery store right in front which is well stocked and the folks speak English pretty well. We used the No 1 (night bus 91) bus to get to the Center of City from the apartment. Easiest we found was to that bus to Freidhemsplan T-station and pretty much anywhere from there. 

I would have no hesitation is recommending Carl's place for your stay in Stockholm.

There's a great little kitchen (ideal for making your own evening meals) and the apartment just had a lovely atmosphere that made us feel at home straight away.  Great location too - it was only 15-20 minutes to get into the city centre by bus or you could take a wonderful walk along the southern edge of Kungsholmen island past parks, boat clubs and get to the Stadshus in about 45 minutes.  We'd recommend it to anyone going to Stockholm!"

The appartment is well situated, so we could take the bus just around the corner for all our excursions.Very near there was an ICA, so we could always buy food for the meals. And in the kitchen, which is top equipped, we had everything we needed.
It´s a pitty, that we couldn´t talk or even read swedish, because Carl´s library is worth to be read!

Unfortunately the first night we arrived, Carl was not able to meet us because he was stuck in another city. He was very accommodating and helped us find a hotel. The second night we were able to stay at the Cosy apartment listed here.

Although our stay in Stockholm started off a bit rocky, it completed nicely and without any further incidents.

Carl's flat is compact and the bed mattress is flush up against the walls. Although very cozy, there is still plenty of room for two people to prepare a snack in the kitchen, eat in the living room, and sit on the shared balcony (which you access via the attic)."

We could see the owner's tidy character from all the details in the room. Books, music, small objects etc ... We could go and come easily by bus between the apartment and the city center. If the weather was nice, we could even walk, I guess. We asked for a few times the change of check-in time (sorry ...) but each time Carl accepted pleasantly. He was such a nice person. Thank you ! "
7225,1124388,14898763,2014-06-29,11034777,Mira,"Carl is a supernice guy and his appartement is small but it has all you need. The loction is one of the best in Stockholm. Supermarket across the street and the bus stop around the corner.

The appartement is clean and the building is quiet. I certainly recommend this place."
7226,1124388,15050213,2014-07-01,13487527,Chloe,"Good location - the number 1 bus goes everywhere! Nice little place to stay, has everything you need. "

7230,1124388,16974102,2014-08-05,14155062,Luca,"We were 3 people staying for 10 nights in Carl's apartment. We found everything very comfortable, and the location is perfect since with the bus n. 1 you can reach the central station and the underground.
We had enough space to cook and eat and to sleep, even if we found the room slightly small for 3 people... But it is enough comfortable to stay in just for the night and other few moments. We are sure that for 2 people is even better.
Carl was very kind to us and gave us precious infos to reach the house.
It has been a great experience and we all thank Carl for it."
7231,1124388,18051390,2014-08-21,5382460,Eric,The appartment was fine and then 1 bus is very pratical. Carl was very helpful with the laundry  issue and we also liked the restaurants near by and we adored the city.
7232,1124388,18395590,2014-08-26,979313,Vera,"Our stay (3 people) in Carl's flat was wonderful. It's really cute, clean and features everything one needs (stove, oven, baking plate, pans, freezer, towels...). For some people the bed (1,20 cm) might be too small to share it, but for us it was no problem. The neighbourhood is very calm and indeed located very close to the city. A bus (Lilla Essingen) or metro station (Thorildsplan) can be reached in a few minutes by foot. 
Carl is a really nice guy, he welcomed us personally and showed us the flat. It was no problem that we arrived rather late and left early. He stayed in the city and offered to help us if we have any problem. I can definitely recommend this flat to everybody! It's close, it's nice and Carl is very friendly."
7233,1124388,18875331,2014-09-02,15290503,Clara Christine,"We were two people and stay for eight days in Carls apartment. We had a wonderful stay in Carls apartment. 
Good location, near the city. We really enjoy it to swim in the lake. Please take a hammock with you! ☺ There are attachment for those (at the lake)! 
I recommend this place.
"
7234,1124388,19405087,2014-09-12,5121032,Adrián,"Carl was great and we loved his apartment. Clean and nice, very well decorated. Filled with books, vinyl records and a very good sound system, he has created a really cozy atmosphere that makes you feel like home. The communication with him was smooth and easy and you have a bus stop around the corner where you can get to the city center in 15-20 minutes. 

Definitely recommended if you want to have great experience in Stockholm. 

-------

Carl es un tío genial y su apartamento es una pasada. Limpio y cuidado al detalle, lo ha decorado con libros y discos para crear una atmósfera muy acogedora que te hará sentir como en casa. La comunicación fue agradable y sin complicaciones y tienes una parada de bus a la vuelta de la esquina que te dejará en el centro en 15-20 minutos.

Muy recomendable si quieres disfrutar de una gran experiencia en Estocolmo."

Carl's apartement is small, but very comfortable and you have there everything you need starting from cooking equipment and finishing with internet. Plus one can spend endless time just admiring his amazing book collection. Place is also very well located for exploring Stockholm. There is frequent public transport connection and in case of nice weather you can actually even walk to the center when you feel a bit more sporty.
So we enjoyed our stay in Carl's flat wery much :)"

Foi muito simpático ao deixar um ovo de Páscoa no apartamento no dia em que chegamos.
Neste dia, à noite, nos fez uma visita e deu algumas dicas sobre pontos turísticos em Estocolmo.
Apesar do apartamento estar um pouco afastado dos pontos turísticos, o transporte ônibus + metro funciona muito bem.
Não achamos que seja vantajoso pagar mais caro para ficar mais próximo desses locais.
Recomendamos a estadia no apartamento do Carl.
Ivan e família."

Carl is a great host, he welcomed us at the apartment had a drink with us and gave a lot of tips with places we might consider visiting both during day and night. Hygiene and cleanness was on a high level. When it comes to its location, the apartment is slightly off the main party/busy area of Stockholm but there is always good public transport connections. Overall, Carl`s apartment is highly recommended.   "

Карл очень тепло нас встретил, ответил на все вопросы и помог адаптироваться на новом месте , очень были тронуты  , что он нас  лично пришёл встречать на остановку. Спасибо и за историческую справку про остров на котором мы жили и конечно же за молоко :-) .
Я буду рекомендовать всем своим друзьям квартиру Карла , и если мы поедем ещё раз в Стокгольм , мы  знаем где  нас тепло встретят. Жить в таком тихом и уютном районе одно удовольствие.

Notre hôte à été très arrangeant pour les horaires d'arrivés dans l'appartement.
Le seul regret, ne pas avoir eu une vraie couette (couette double).
Je recommande cet appartement :)"
7290,1124388,63345667,2016-02-22,1801276,Delanie,"Basic, cute apartment near a grocery store and bus stop. Easy, flat, pretty walk along the water to all the downtown sites in 40-60 mins. Quiet and comfortable. Definitely a guy's apartment. A girly girl might not prefer this. Local pizza place was good. Very safe to walk everywhere."
7291,1124388,64280583,2016-03-02,26923290,Catherine,"Le logement de Carl est sur une petite île tranquille à stockholm facilement accessible en autobus. Il y a une épicerie juste en face ce qui est très pratique.

Carl a été un excellent hôte. Avant notre arrivée il a toujours été disponible pour répondre à nos questions sur stockholm. À notre arrivée le logement était impeccable et il a partagé avec nous beaucoup d'informations sur la ville. Il nous a laissé un carte avec les attractions principales et nous a bien expliqué le fonctionnement des lieux.

Le logement est cosy et à été parfait pour 3 personnes. Le lit supplémentaire était très confortable. La cuisine chez Carl est très bien équipée pour des gens qui désirent faire à manger en voyage. Carl nous a également laisser les essentiels pour cuisiner (huile, épices etc.) ainsi que café et thé pour le petit déjeuner. 

Je recommande fortement le logement de Carl et y retournerai avec plaisir à ma prochaine visite à stockholm."

7294,1124388,69852984,2016-04-14,979313,Vera,"I stayed at the flat already the second time and still everything was fine. Communication, arrival and departure are uncomplicated. The neighbourhood is just great and super close to Västerbron and Kungsholmen. I'm still fascinated by the broad collection of books he has ;-)"
7295,1124388,71027523,2016-04-23,39251031,Maxime,"This host was very nice, a very good welcome the day of our arrival. A lot of catalogs of what to do in Stockholm and in its nearest areas in different languages. The island were is the accomodation, is a bit far from the center but there is still buses to go, and by walking there is a beautiful point of view (if we follow the mälaren sea) of stockholm and the city hall (very nice with the sunset). There is everything necessary in the appartment, even a vinyl reader to listen ABBA for example"
7296,1124388,72893357,2016-05-05,20100127,Costis,Very nice cost apartment. Very easy to get to the center via bus. Supermarket and restaurants close in the neiboughood.

7297,1124388,73729299,2016-05-09,64215654,Patsy,"Carl was a delightful host. He was so helpful in explaining different ways to get to his flat and the costs and routes involved. He was waiting for us with a welcome drink and was generous with his time and answered all our questions to orient us to a weekend in Stockholm.  
The flat is light and we found it had everything we needed in a charming student- like style, including an eclectic range of books and music. We did not cook bigger meals but everything was available to do so. Showers hot and very efficient.
The flat is on a pretty little island just a 12min bus ride from the central station. Very frequent bus service. There are several choices for eating out within a few steps of the flat, as well as a very good convenience store on the corner."
7298,1124388,74543771,2016-05-15,28605818,Claire,"Me and my two friends stayed in Carl's apartment during our trip to Stockholm and would really recommend it. Carl was a very welcoming and friendly host, giving us detailed directions before we arrived and leaving maps, information etc in the apartment with us for our stay.  The apartment was cosy and well-equipped with everything we needed, and was well located for public transport so we could get everywhere we needed to go really easily. "

Carl left a list of sites and restaurants to visit along with plenty of maps and brochures. The apartment is on a small, quiet island that is only a short bus ride away from the bigger parts of the city but perfect for a more relaxing experience of Stockholm. "
7301,1124388,78393522,2016-06-06,24743911,Angela,We stayed 3 nights at Carl's studio.  Carl was very communicative and helpful.  The neighborhood was good.
7302,1124388,79378832,2016-06-12,58082823,Amanda,"My one reservation would be the location -- it was not as central as we would've liked. Otherwise, Carl was a wonderful host and was very proactive in making sure we knew how to get to the apartment, and to and from the downtown area. The place was exactly as pictured in the listing - clean and spacious!"

Mon amie et moi vous recommandons chaudement cet appartement pour sa situation géographique (à 20 min de la gare centrale en bus, arrêt du bus et magasin à proximité ouvert de 8h à 22h, endroit calme avec nature aux alentours).  Notre hôte Carl s'est montré discret, mais très sympathique et efficace.

My gf and I had a great experience in Stockholm, thanks to Carl. 

When we first got in touch with him, he replied very quickly and gave us the informations we needed. He sent us some others details about the easiest way to get there (maps, bus line...) few days before we went to Sweden. We were a bit late, but he was kind enough to wait for us and explained us different things about his appartment. Carl let at disposal in many languages brochures about Stockholm and maps.

Actually, it is all as indicated in the description he has made on this website. Good appt, great location (bus stop to central station, a convenient store open from 8.00 am to 10.00 pm, quiet place, nature...).

To sum it up : +++++

We both really enjoyed our stay in Stockholm and recommand you this great place whose host is great as well.

He sent clear and accurate instructions for reaching Stockholm from the airport, and then reaching his apartment from the train station. The apartment was exactly as described, and in fact quite lovely. Everything worked; in particular the shower was quite nice and we were able to find everything needed to use the stove (including staples such as oil and salt, as well as some spices).

Карл очень интересуется русской культурой, много знает о нашем кино - было здорово с ним пообщаться на эту тему. Книг великое количество - на всемозможные темы! 
Еще, нам понравилось, что нет телевизора - зато такая классная аудиосистема, мы постоянно местноеьрок-радио слушали по утрам, а по вечерам пластинки. Романтика:)
Квартира маленькая, но там есть все, что нужно, все очень функционально! Нам не хватило только микроволновки, но и то пару раз всего.
Район очень тихий и маленький - обошла его весь за 20 минут вокруг. Окружен водой, приятный для пробежек. Рядом магазин, где есть все.
Удобно добираться до любых мест, езды минут 15 до Гамла Стана. 
В общем, рекомендуем.
Спасибо, Карл!)"

Located in a great part of town which is an excellent distance from the city - Easily reachable via bus or bus+metro, or walk.
 
The apartment has a nice charm to it and easily accommodated 3.

Express supermarket is located across the street which is also very convenient. 

Carl is polite, friendly and seems like a genuine and very approachable guy.

Thanks Carl.

Carl was there when I arrived and he checked in during my stay to make sure I had everything I needed. The apartment is equipped with everything needed for both a business and private trip and the 10 to 15-minute bus ride from the central station makes it conveniently located. The neighborhood is very quiet, but the busier parts of the city are within easy reach. "

Einfach zu erreichen und gut an die Innenstadt angeschlossen. Da wir tolles Wetter hatten, sind wir meist zu Fuß bis in die Stadt gelaufen - immer am Wasser entlang, einfach toll.
Vor unserer Ankunft hat Carl uns mit allen notwendigen Infos versorgt, damit wir problemlos zu ihm finden. Das war super und hat sehr gut funktioniert.
Die Wohnung selbst ist klein, aber gemütlich. Alles, was wir brauchten haben wir gefunden und würden sofort wieder dort übernachten."

Carl ist ein sehr guter Gastgeber...bevor wir anreisten hatte er uns mit Infos versorgt und Kontakt zu uns aufgenommen. An unserer Anreise hatte er uns sogar an der Bushaltestelle abgeholt und zu der Wohnung begleitet und uns dann alles gezeigt. 
Meine Freundin und ich können es nur weiterempfehlen nach Stockholm zu fahren und dann in Carl's Wohnung zu übernachten.

Seine Wohnung liegt perfekt, um sich die Stockholm anzugucken oder einfach nur ein paar entspannte Tage in der Stadt zu verbringen!"

He offered to pick us up from the bus station and showed us around in his apartment. We had time to ask everything we needed to ask, he also checked in with us via text mssg during our stay. The apartment looked exactly like on the pictures. It is a small place and has everything one might need. The value for your money is great. 
The public transport connection is awesome. Only 10-15min by bus (station right in front of the house) to T-Centralen. Right in front of the house are also a big enough supermarket, drug store and restaurants. 
So all in all we definitely enjoyed our stay, everything was super easy. Thanks!"

Die Lage ist einfach toll, wenn man Stockholm erkunden möchte. Lilla Essingen ist ein sehr sympathisches Quartier, von Wasser umgeben. Man ist mit dem Bus sehr schnell im Zentrum von Stockholm oder bei der nächsten U-Bahn-Station. Ein Laden, der bis 22 Uhr geöffnet hat, ist direkt vor der Haustür. Auch die Fußwege ins Stadtzentrum oder von dort zurück entlang dem Mälarensee sind sehr schön und nicht zu weit. 
Carl war sehr freundlich und verlässlich und hat sich rührend um unsere Bedürfnisse gekümmert. Er gab uns auch wichtige und gute Tipps zu Verkehrsverbindungen, Sehenswürdigkeiten und guten Lokalen in Stockholm. Sehr empfehlenswerte Adresse!"

Nous avons aussi apprécié le quartier, certes résidentiel mais au bord de l'eau avec une belle promenade, des airs de jeux pour enfants et malgré tout très proche du centre en bus ( 10 à 15 min de city terminalen) avec un petit commerce au pied de la résidence ainsi que quelques restaurants ( pizzeria, tapas).
Enfin, accueil et disponibilité parfaite de l'hôte.
A noter, la chambre n'est pas close et le lit est plutôt petit, tout dépend du gabarit des dormeurs!"

7345,1124388,204265214,2017-10-17,13956302,Dani,"the place is located about 40 mins by walking from the centre old town area. The walk is very pleasant by the island coastline if the weather s good. besides, there is public transport (bus number 1) nearby (3 mins) which will take to the heart of centre in just about 15 mins. 

there is a good supermarket downstairs which is very convenient. The kitchen is very good and spacious to prepare a good meal which can save you a lot considering the eating out in Stockholm is very expensive.

Carl has a good stereo system (B&0) in this apartment so you can enjoy and relax in the night. It is a budget choice for people who plan to visit Stockholm and do not want to only stay in a touristic area only."
7346,1124388,218157779,2017-12-11,158039089,Risto,"Great place if you need stay in Stockholm. Close to everything, Carl gave us all information that we needed.

Parfait pour deux personnes, il est très sympa et assez équipé (frigo, four, plaques, bouilloire, machine à café, bon équipement musique et radio). Cependant, un peu éloigné du centre si l'on veut tout faire à pieds: je dirais une quarantaine de minutes. Tout même très accessible en bus (ligne très régulière qui amène à l'hypercentre en moins de 15 minutes). La communication avec Carl était très fluide (anglais), il a été très réactif ! Bref, je recommande ce logement pour un séjour dans la belle ville de Stockholm !"
7348,1124388,229930343,2018-01-26,18446612,Gracie,"Had a short trip to Stockholm and stayed in Carl's lovely little flat. Perfect for 1-2 people for a comfortable short stay, even 3 if you're just using it  as somewhere to crash amongst seeing Stockholm! 
The flat was comfortable and homely, with plenty of bits and pieces to accomodate cooking/eating when there. Good shower, nice and warm (given it being -4 outside) and quiet/safe block of flats and area. 
Transport links to city centre were fantastic and regular, running late at night when needed. Local store was just across the road had everything you needed grocery wise. Not many local bars/restaurants, however central area only 10 min by bus, so no problems to get out in the evening. 
Would strongly recommend for a break in Stockholm, easy to get around to main attractions, and to/from Central Station/Arlanda Airport. Thank you! "
7349,1124388,236004711,2018-02-18,160602329,Sarah,Everything was as described. Carl is a wonderful host - he even picked us up from the bus station. If we come back (and we definitely will because Stockholm is amazing) we will take Carls apartment again.
7350,1124388,239585865,2018-03-02,115939403,Alexander,Super Unterkunft. Carl hat uns rechtzeitig viele hilfreiche Tipps gegeben und war stets für alle unsere Fragen da. Sauber und sehr gute Lage neben einem Supermarkt und neben einer Bushaltestelle. Der Bus fuhr alle paar Minuten ins Zentrum. Kann ich nur weiterempfehlen.

7353,1124388,252330319,2018-04-10,141896653,Emma,"Just spent 5 nights in Carl's lovely little (Website hidden by Airbnb) is warm, cosy and very welcoming.Plenty of space for two of us and even managed to squeeze my daughter in for the last night (really comfy fold out bed).  The flat is positioned about 3 mins from the bus stop and a fantastic transport system that can take you anywhere round Stockholm. (we got the weeks travel card - and downloading the app is a must).
Lovely little island with fantastic views and amazing bakers (wonderful cardamon buns!!) and a small supermarket just across the road in case you need anything.
Already planning our return trip!!"
7354,1124388,256652064,2018-04-23,87100419,Isabelle,"Appartement accueillant, idéal pour deux personnes en court séjour. Le quartier est très calme, très agréable pour la promenade. Il y a des commerces et des restaurants au pied de l'immeuble. Pour aller en centre ville il faut prendre le bus et le métro. C'est rapide et cela permet de voir les différents quartiers de la ville. Carl a été très accueillant, très prévenant. Il s'est libéré pour nous accueillir et nous a donné de bons conseils de sorties."
7355,1124388,259160332,2018-04-30,33743836,Egor,"This is the perfect variant with good cost! It’s very cute apartment in attractive district!

Das Appartment ist klein aber vollkommen ausreichend für einen Städtetrip.

Carl ist freundliche und hilfsbereit. Wir wurden sogar an der Bushaltestelle abgeholt.
Einziges kleines Manko war, dass das Geschirr teilweise nicht zu 100% sauber war.
Alles in allem sehr empfehlenswert! Gerne wieder."

Carl also gives couple of tips/tricks you can use and is available (on the phone) when you need him, thank you for having us :) "

7364,1124388,302860158,2018-08-06,64448612,Saskia,"This Apartment is good for two persons.
It is great located in quiet Lilla Essingen. Just a few steps to a supermarket and the bus Station. With the bus you can directly drive to the city centre in 10-15 minutes. And it departs every few minutes.
Carl is a really nice host, he picked us up from the bus stop and was very helpful in everything.
Also the communication before arriving was good, helpful and with a lot of information."

Highly recommended."
7366,1124388,310814002,2018-08-20,8457273,Beatrice,"I really enjoyed staying at Carl's place. The flat is stylish and clean,  with everything you need. It is connected to the centre of Stockholm by a direct bus that takes you there in roughly 15
minutes, and it is a 3 minutes walk 
to the bus stop. Super easy! There is a convenience store just across the building and a few affordable yet nice places to eat locally. Carl has been very helpful and always available, a great host. 
"
7367,1124388,323917888,2018-09-16,177392242,Amanda,Cosy apartment with all the basics. Carl was always v.quick to respond and very helpful with local knowledge.
7368,1124388,327660916,2018-09-24,100602940,Jon,"Carl’s apartment was great, enough room for two friends, using the spare bed. He had great communication supplies us with directions and maps to get to the apartment. The apartment is about 30 minutes from the city centre using public transport which was fine for us. With late buses too. Would recommend for a trip to Stockholm."
7369,1124388,329517302,2018-09-29,106838585,Thaïs,"We wish the place had been as welcoming and nice as Carl (who was a great host - he even picked us up from the bus stop). 
But the place was dusty, and generally not clean. We had to ask for toilet paper, and the bed wasn’t made when we checked in (and no towels). Something was quite smelly in the fridge. And the blankets were super tiny and thin for quite a cold weather! A bit disappointed."
7370,1124388,337399398,2018-10-16,95414987,Anya,Cosy flat. Perfect for what we needed it for. About an hour’s walk into central Stockholm along a beautiful route. Close to supermarket and restaraunts a short walk away.

7372,1124388,342654329,2018-10-29,183323288,Paulius,"Carl was hospitable and caring as a host. He gave me tips on ways of getting around and provided information on major attractions in the city. He was communicative and flexible regarding the check-in and the overall experience.
As for the appartment, it's a great find. It has a pretty neat location (about 12-15 minutes from the centre by bus). The appartment provides more than enough space for a single person, would be ok for two.

A sidenote: in case you ever end up tired of exploring the city, Carl has an impressive library of books for you to spend an evening with."
7373,1124388,344715381,2018-11-04,110769109,Laura,"Die Lage war super, alles war gut mit Bus und Bahn zu erreichen 

Carl schickte uns vorab Infos für den Bus von Flughafen zum Apartment 

Die Leute in der Straße (in Geschäften) waren sehr zuvorkommen und hilfsbereit 

Immer wieder gern!!"
7374,1124388,349797106,2018-11-18,19053303,Lucy,Carl was really helpful. The check in and check out times fitted around us. Location was quite but easy to get to the centre. Great stay

The supermarket and the bus-stop are around the corner. 
We highly recommend Carls apartement for your next trip to Stockholm."

7380,1124388,408696530,2019-02-05,141826694,Sylke,"Nice apartment as described, on a small island just west of Gamla stan. Carl ist a great host and provided us with very helpful information on how to get there from the airport and on things to do in town. Thanks again, Carl, we'll surely bei back :) Sylke"
7381,1124388,410419720,2019-02-10,28453495,Rose,"Carl was a wonderful host. He responded quickly and in detail to all questions. On the day of arrival, he came to meet us at the bus stop despite the fact that we arrived at midnight. He showed us around and made sure that we had everything we needed.
The flat is in an ideal location, walkable to the city centre on a fine day or easily accessible by bus in the snowy weather we experienced. The area is perfect for travellers with a 7/11 opposite the flat, nearby restaurants and bars and great links to transport.
The flat itself is ideal for everyone's needs. Carl has made it feel lovely and homely. All of the home comforts are there and his vast collection of books, vinyls and pictures on the wall give an overall sophisticated feel to the place. We enjoyed our experience immensely and look forward to visiting again soon!"
7382,1124388,416856517,2019-02-25,51083604,Annette,Mysig och ombonad lägenhet med ett centralt läge. Lugnt och tyst fridfullt och naturnära. Helt nära Mälaren med utsikt över sjön där du kan ta ett morgondopp mitt i staden . Det är svårslaget. Carl var vänlig och snabb att återkoppla fanns inget att klaga på. Med vänlig hälsning Annette och Thord
7383,1124388,422885938,2019-03-12,2835793,Luca,The apartment is quite confortable for one person that need to pay a visit to Stockholm and relax after a long day spent around in the city. It is well positioned and well connected to pubblic trasportation. Carl is a precise person and will provide essential information according to the guest needs. I would recommend the experience
7384,1124388,428572333,2019-03-25,93762624,Sam,"Absolute legend, wonderful place and awesome location"
7385,1124388,434660980,2019-04-08,61080678,Leo,"Carls apartment is good value in an expensive city. It’s fairly conveniently located (10min by bus, 40min by foot to the inner city). He was very friendly and waited for our late arrival. However, the bed is VERY small for two people, especially given the plywood walls on both sides. Then again, Carl quickly provided us with an extra bed. I’m sure there are apartments with better value, but Carl’s was all in all satisfying."
7386,1124388,437892102,2019-04-15,29677298,Rachele,"Carl m'a envoyé un mail avant l'arrivée avec toutes les informations nécessaires pour bien arriver à l'appartement (bus et lignes conseillées, une carte avec l'indication précise de l'appartement et les divers codes d'accès et lieux importants dans les alentours). Ils nous a accueilli à notre arrivée et soigné la propreté de l'appartement. Plein de bonnes informations et bonnes adresses, il nous a même envoyé un message pour nous informer d'un marché particulier qui avait lieu pendant notre séjour. Vraiment une personne attentionné et disponible.
L'appartement est conforme à la description, lumineux et fourni de tout le nécessaire. Une ferry juste à deux pas de l'appartement emmene jusqu'à la mairie, à côté de Gamla Stan, Carl a contacté les transports publics pour nous donner les horaires exactes du bateau, vraiment un geste très attentionné !
Nous les conseillons vraiment !"

Sehr gute Kommunikation mit dem Gastgeber und wertvolle Tipps bekommen. Sehr unkomplizierter Check in. Würden wir immer wieder machen. :-)"
7388,1124388,455164551,2019-05-19,26595259,Andrea,Nice and cosy flat. Good location when you love to walk and experience the city by foot and bike.
7389,1124388,459373498,2019-05-27,22721485,Sophie,Carl's place is lovely and located not very far from the city centre (15min by bus). We had a lovely time and Carl was very attentive and ensured everything went smoothly with checking in and out and during our stay. Would definitely recommend it!
7390,1124388,464301527,2019-06-05,212758001,Jörg,"Carl war extrem hilfreich und gab sehr viele Informationen, wie wir vom Flughafen zur Unterkunft kommen konnten. Er hat persönlich an der Bushaltestelle gewartet und uns zur Unterkunft geführt. Die Unterkunft ist bestens mit Öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln zu erreichen. Die Bushaltestelle liegt in unmittelbarer nähe. Man braucht ca 5 Minuten zu fuß um zur Fähre zu gelangen, welche direkt ins Stadtzentrum fährt (ca 10 min Fahrt). Die Fahrt mit der Fähre war definitiv ein Highlight. Auf der anderen Straßenseite gibt es einen Supermarkt. Die Wohnung befindet sich auf einer kleinen Insel, welche man in einer halben Stunde umlaufen kann. Ein Abendspaziergang lohnt sich definitiv. Die Lage der Wohnung ist wirklich fantastisch. Die Wohnung selbst ist sehr klein. Wir waren zu dritt und es ist vom Platz her in Ordnung zum Übernachten. Wenn man bei schlechtem Wetter Zuhause bleiben will, ist die für drei Personen wahrscheinlich zu klein. Die Sauberkeit war in Ordnung, jedoch nicht überragend. Eben eine alte Studentenbude. Ich würde sie vielleicht nicht meinen Großeltern empfehlen, jedoch für junge Leute die perfekte Unterkunft für einen Städtetrip."
7391,1124388,475490102,2019-06-24,161954231,Thomas,"Super Host, Super good location,  a little bit small for 3 people but it's fine"
7392,1124388,478558292,2019-06-30,170350602,Arto,Great place and Carl was very helpful. Highly recommended!
7393,1124388,481774986,2019-07-05,21494769,Tom,"Fantastic place! Very easy to get around as there is a bus stop and ferry stop close by. There is a lovely running path around the island as well, which was good for us to shake out our legs from traveling. Carl had great tips on local food and history, and his book/record collection is fantastic. Highly recommend!"
7394,1124388,490143552,2019-07-18,101916300,伊辰,So good .i will be back definitely again
7395,1124388,494314595,2019-07-24,14066912,Tina,The place is  very well connected by bus and it was nice that Carl picked us up. I can recommend it very much for tourists who don't want to take long bus transfers and like to enjoy island life in Stockholm.
7396,1124388,504657999,2019-08-08,199620596,Samantha,"The time in Stockholm and Carl‘s apartment was great. The apartment is small, but you find everything you need for a citytrip. Carl is very friendly and helpful. The island Lilla Essingen is wonderful and you reach the center in 15 minutes by bus or ferry. We recommend Carl and the apartment :)"
7397,1124388,517401714,2019-08-25,4651337,Alessio,The apartment is as described. Nice and comfortable. We stayed in two people for four nights. The place is not far from the centre and in Stockholm the public transports are well organized. Carl was very nice and he gave us all the information and suggestions for our visit too. He was helpful for the check in (he waited for us at the bus station) as well for the time of check out (we had the flight in the afternoon). Absolutely recommended.
7398,1124388,521613792,2019-09-01,19460855,Johann,We had a very nice long weekend at Carl's place which was very enjoyable. The apartment is well connected to public transport and it was easy to get to places across the city. The apartment itself is very cozy and we felt quite comfortable there.
7399,1128990,5662652,2013-07-10,2312039,Jackie,"Anette was an excellent host - very flexible with our travel plans and the apartment was just as we expected it, if not a little bigger. She even left a bit of breakfast food for us! The apartment was clean, the building was in an excellent location, and everyone we were travelling with had a great experience. I would highly reccomend this apartment!"
7400,1128990,5852678,2013-07-19,7325577,Morten,"Hyggelig vert og fin ren leilighet som ligger sentralt til rett sør for Gamla Stan. Det tar 15-20 min å gå dit. Ellers var området stille og fredelig, med flere spisesteder også i nærområdet. Vi var heldoge med været om Stockholm er en flott by. Vi koste oss der"
7401,1128990,5920946,2013-07-22,3090872,Hannah,Fantastic location and great host. Loved the neighbourhood. Thanks Anette!
7402,1128990,6532186,2013-08-16,2835935,Dmitry,"We stayed a whole family with 3 kids. Anette is a great hostess. There is plenty of space in the apartment, rooms are big. The apartment is not a ""new"", but newly painted. Quite clean. The location is very good, in nice neighborhood with a lot of shops and restaurant. Walking distance from Stockholm old center. The only problem is to find a parking for a car."
7403,1128990,7304778,2013-09-15,5358135,Judith,An apartment could not be located more conveniently in relation to where we needed to be in Stockholm! It was literally right up the road. The communication with Anette went smoothly at all times. Thanks for allowing us in! :)
7404,1128990,8374717,2013-10-28,8774738,Mai,"I booked this apartment for my friends. It is the very comfortable apartment.

Anette is so kind that she helped me a lot  before I booked. My friends who stayed here had great time!

I highly recommend the apartment and Anette as host."
7405,1128990,8560120,2013-11-05,1831748,Alexander,"I spent 3 days with friends in a wonderful Anette's apartment. I have to admit that the apartment is not ""brand-new"", but it does not become less comfortable. Location is good, the city center within walking distance, the infrastructure around very good. The apartment has everything you need for a comfortable stay."
7406,1128990,8604445,2013-11-07,9675569,Gemma,Anette is a perfect host! The apartment was really nice and very well placed! 
7407,1128990,12213578,2014-04-26,10752881,Tim,"My family and I had a great time in Stockholm and really enjoyed our stay at Anette's apartment.  Sodermalm is a great suburb and Anette's place is strategically located.  The apartment is spacious and comfortable - plenty of room for the four of us. Anette is an excellent host - there to meet us on our arrival, ready to assist with any queries, generous with the provisions she left for us and flexible with our departure arrangements.  We would not hesitate to stay at Anette's place again."
7408,1128990,13814555,2014-06-05,9837607,Michelle,"Anette's apartment is lovely, bright, and spacious. She was very friendly and even left us some breakfast food, coffee and tea. What a lovely welcome! The location is perfect for exploring sodermalm and is 10 min from the subway. Security was good and it was quiet. The living area has a lovely big comfortable couch to relax in. The apartment was very clean. Was a pleasure to stay there! Note the bathroom has a hand held shower over bath which can be awkward to use if you're not used to it! I highly recommend Anette's apartment. Thank you very much. The three of us had a wonderful time there!"
7409,1128990,14288036,2014-06-16,15317513,Christopher,"We were met by a friend of our host who very helpfully showed us round the apartment, gave us neighbourhood advice for cafes/restaurants etc, explained the arrangements about check out, and gave us a contact number if there were any problems. Our host had already told us about this and left us some very welcome provisions in the fridge, especially helpful as we arrived quite late in the day, had not visited the area before and do not speak Swedish!
The apartment was very well located for a lovely part of Stockholm (Sodermalm) and we were very pleased with all the facilities the apartment and area offered - great for families. We really appreciated having a bath as we had our 1 year old grandson with us, though some people might prefer a more standard shower facility."
7410,1128990,14691330,2014-06-24,13410248,Lora,"Ultimately we were happy with Anette's apartment but I was disappointed at first that the place was not cleaner. It seemed that a quick cleaning had missed things like dust on mirrors and food in microwave. But the beds were comfortable and it was the perfect location, blocks from lots of cafes and restaurants and cool vintage shops and an easy 10 min walk to the subway station, and 20 to Gamla Stan old town area and its historic sites. The apartment was big enough for us to relax in living room before going out at night. The shower took some getting used to (we weren't accustomed to handheld showers faucets that you hold over yourself with one arm) but that was part of the experience. Anete was also responsive to my emails with questions about how to work the coffee maker and where to put recycling, and she kindly lent us a converter.

7411,1128990,16839118,2014-08-03,9281078,Isobel,"Had a great weekend stay in Anette's apartment. Perfectly located in SoFo. Plenty of space for 4 people and had a big living room and kitchen too.
Thanks Anette"
7412,1128990,17641484,2014-08-15,12032302,Daniel,"Anette has a nice apartment with a good location in the ""Sofo"" neighborhood of Stockholm. The area has great restaurants, with designer shops spread out in the neighboring blocks. It's pleasant, mostly quiet and 10 minutes from Gamlastan, the historical center. Anette was helpful with the check-in time and left us some basic provisions which were useful. The apartment has good light and accommodates 4 people (sharing one bathroom). The shortfalls for us were the lack of a washing machine (the laundry service outside was pricey), that it's a bit cluttered and, while in general it was fine, the flat needs a deep cleaning. Otherwise the flat is spacious and its located in a nice neighborhood of Stockholm."
7413,1128990,18481537,2014-08-27,17657333,Susan,"We really enjoyed our stay at Anette's apartment.  It was very cozy and in a great neighbourhood.   Anette was kind enough to leave supplies for breakfasts as well as plenty of coffee and tea.  There is wifi and satellite tv. The beds were great and the living room was  comfortable for relaxing after a day out. We loved Stockholm and hope to visit again.  When we do, and if we come with our children, we would be happy to stay at Anette's."
7414,1128990,25022083,2015-01-05,22498007,Rafael,"What a spacious apartment in a great part of town!  Anette greeted us the day we arrived and graciously showed us around her home which was perfect for me, my wife, and our daughter during our week-long stay in Stockholm.

The room was a bit packed with her things, so hanging jackets in the closet was not possible. The two twin beds were comfortable but we noticed some moths flying around the last night. Location of the room is fantastic. It's walking distance to plenty of shops, cafes, grocery stores, and bars. Overall, a great place!"

Although internet connection was intermittent, her place was indeed a surprise, nice and quiet, right in the middle of an urban neighborhood. It was accessible to eating places, the supermarket, and a convenient store was just almost next to the apartment in the corner. Parks were also such a welcome boost, plus a quick walk towards a beautiful overlooking view of the river and the sunset while I was there -- these were enough to connect me to nature and make me feel relaxed especially after a hectic one-week Conference! I even had to walk only 5 min.to get to the Church last Sunday. The Old Town and museums were also walking distance. Super like! I strongly recommend Yvonne's place!"

Emma may ask you to take care for her flowers if you stay around summer. But that was no problem for us because we really felt like being at home. Neighborhood and backyard are very quiet what guarantees you peaceful nights. Emma's adress is easily reachable from Arlanda airport. Just take the ""Flygbussarna"" to Hornstull. From there it's just a 5 minute walk. City-bike and subway station are just around the corner what makes it very easy to explore Stockholm. Emma provided all necessary information about arrival, shopping facilities, things to see and to do in the city. Thank you once again, Emma! :-)   "

Bedroom is quiet with good bed and balcony. Kitchen is good for breakfast, we did not try any serious cooking.  For a longer stay maybe TV would be nice to have. There is a busstop 59 just around the corner and ten minutes walk to tube. Great deli-restaurant around the corner, a bit expensive but just great! It was lovely to stay in Sofo. Gabriel was promt with communication via messages. We had a great trust that everything will go well and our expectations were oversucceed! Gabriel was flexible with check-in and out. We give a warm recommendation!"
7490,1137050,11226259,2014-03-25,7345249,Thomas,"We had a great stay at Gabriel's place! Communication from start to end was excellent. The location was superb and the apartment has a great bohemian and creative feel. Don't hesitate, I'm coming back next time!"

7492,1137050,12067536,2014-04-22,4628250,Lindsay,"My boyfriend and I spent two nights in Stockholm and had a wonderful stay in Gabriel's apartment in Sofo.  Location was perfect, apartment was clean and looked just like photos.  We didn't get a chance to meet Gabriel in person as he was away for the weekend but he left very clear instructions on how to find the apartment, left a key for us, and was communicative all weekend, checking in and making sure we were comfortable and no issues or questions.   It's a great spot if looking to stay in Sofo."
7493,1137050,12890489,2014-05-13,13684158,Georgina Rose,"Gabriel and his fantastic apartment exceeded our expectations in every way. All communications were brilliant and the whole trip went without a hitch, which made everything stress free. The apartment was extremely clean, comfortable, arty and super stylish…..a fab vibe. When we arrived late at night, the apartment instantly felt welcoming with pastries, milk, orange juice etc. there for out breakfast the next day. The apartment was in the middle of a very cool neighbourhood, with interesting shops, trendy bars and yummy restaurants. Apart from during the day, we pretty much just made the most of staying in Sofo and all that it had to offer. We lived in the Urban Deli, just around the corner where we had supper and bought lots of daily treats, a very spoiling 'corner store'. The whole trip was one to be treasured and I know that having a wonderful place to call home for 4 days really was the cherry on the top. Thank you Gabriel for the use of your wonderful home and we are already looking forward to booking in our next trip…."
7494,1137050,13407649,2014-05-27,10634140,Céline,"I booked this appartment for my parent's. Gabriel has been a fantastic host : he explained everything to them (in french !), showed them the neighborhood, helped them to purchase transport tickets... He answered very quickly when they had a question and even booked their taxi for the way back to the aiport. 
The appartment is at a perfect place, close to the subway, bus stop in the street, walking distance to everything (my parents are 70 and 75, they didn't think they could do everything so easily). The neighborhood is very friendly, appartment cosy and well equiped, nice balcony, perfect for a couple.
Thank you Gabriel, you helped to make my parents stay in Stockholm unforgettable !"
7495,1137050,13651625,2014-06-02,12343363,Juergen,"My wife Brigitte and I stayed for 3 nights in lovely Stockholm.
We got a perfect and quick explanation how to reach the flat from the airport.
We got a warm welcome from the owner Gabriel and he showed us directly all rooms and how to use the facilities. Everything was cleaned and in good order and condition. Gabriel was very polite and friendly!
From our point of view was Gabriel's flat the perfect place to live in the center of SoFo, we loved it!
We didn't see the neighborhood and we didn't hear them at all. The nights were  really quiet, which surprised us for such an area, and bright for a German. :o)
Our conclusion: We loved to stay in SoFo, we like to come back and just in Gabriel's flat of course!  --Many thanks again--"
7496,1137050,14428927,2014-06-19,13010217,Suwa,"'Perfect' what else I can say about Gabriel's flat!
The place was perfect!
The neighbor was perfect!
The host was perfect!

The flat was super clean, comfy, and artsy-craftsy! Everything was well placed and prepared for guest. The bed was amazingly comfortable as well. 
The neighbor hood was perfectly great to chill out any time. So many restaurants, bars around the flat. 
Some kind of Bohemian attitude about the flat and neighbor creates a certain vibe to make yourself cool and artsy in some point. Hard to explain the exact detail of it. But if someone try to stay there, you will definitely feel it as I did.

Above all, Gabriel was the most perfect host for me! He was a very kind and attentive for me to stay safe ! All communications couldn't be better than any. He answered the questions very quickly and explained every detail that I ask for.
Thank you Gabriel for me to have a great memories about Stockholm!

7497,1137050,15772371,2014-07-15,4001911,Gerard,"Gabriel’s apartment is simply fantastic. Not only is it very well organized he has impeccable taste. I loved the Bohemian studio look and it was a great fit for me (as I am also interested in art and painting). In fact the place is so nice that I felt almost more like a museum curator rather than a guest!
The area itself is lively, with an array of nice bars and restaurants, as well as a small park - very useful for relaxing after a hard day’s work (I was over on business).
Gabriel himself was very helpful. Not only did he comprehensively answer all my questions but also he was very accommodating as to my arrival date, and left milk and juice in the fridge.
Definitely will be looking to stay there again next time I’m in Stockholm (…although that’s going to be harder with many more reviews like this!!!)

7498,1137050,18734153,2014-08-31,17752274,Aurelie,Gabriel a su nous guider des la sortie du bus pour aller jusqu à son appartement! On découvre un espace magnifique aménagé avec goût! Le lit est très confortable et Gabriel nous laisse de quoi préparer notre ptit déjeuner le lendemain! Nous avons été ravi de notre séjour chez lui! Je recommande vivement cette location et j ai déjà hâte de revenir! Merci encore Gabriel! 
7499,1137050,19789473,2014-09-18,5657626,Chia,"What a beautiful appartement! We had a absolutely perfect stay there. It is really good located, quiet, but still close to nice cafés and restaurants. We were walking distance from everything. Gabriel was the perfect host and kept in contact with us to make sure we were all set and he gives his opinion of the places he thinks visitors would enjoy, even my next city Copenhagen. If you come to Stockholm and need a place to stay, I highly recommend you consider Gabriel's apartment. You won't regret it."
7500,1137050,20792381,2014-10-05,6810861,Angela,"We had a lovely stay. The apartment is easy to find and well situated, being close to some of Södermalm's most desirable bars and restaurants. Gabriel was a great host and it was easy to contact him during our stay. We loved the bed (so comfy) and the shower was great - welcome after a long day's exploring the city! WiFi also very speedy. Note there isn't a tv - not that it bothered us in the slightest as we didn't want to waste time in exploring such an interesting city. I would happily recommend this apartment and would have no hesitation in booking again.  Thanks again Gabriel!"
7501,1137050,21220111,2014-10-13,1938509,Roland,"We, my girlfriend and I, had a great time in Stockholm and in Gabriels apartment. Everything worked superfantastic and easy. The apartment is very charming, beautiful and has everything needed. And it was absolutely clean. 
Even though we didn't meet him personaly, the communication with Gabriel was easy, he was obliging, provided all information needed and offered his help."
7502,1137050,22428796,2014-11-06,386994,Sal,"My wife and I stayed in Gabriel's apartment during our one week stay in STK. Overall perfect! Amazing decoration, lovely details, great shower, fast internet, very cute and functional kitchen, Gabriel is always available to help with anything but above all things an outstanding location. We walked everywhere in the city during our stay and where never bored exploring the neighborhood. If in STK again for sure I'll stay at Gabriel's. "
7503,1137050,28152783,2015-03-18,4311871,Clara,"Gabriel was the perfect host--I enjoyed every minute of my stay in his art-inspired flat. I was on a writing deadline and his space provided both inspiration and a quiet, calm atmosphere. Everything was in perfect order, the apartment is in the epicenter of a trendy Stockholm neighborhood, and the bed was divine! Gabriel was also kind enough to let us stay an extra day. "
7504,1137050,31080977,2015-05-01,3807375,Lisa,"Gabriel is an excellent host and his place is very well-situated in Sodermalm, very close to many excellent restaurants and bars and even a great record store.
He was gracious enough to accommodate my last-minute request and he was very prompt with his replies. We had a nice but brief chat when I arrived at his place and he checked up on me after the first night to make sure everything was going well.
I definitely got the sense that he loves the area he lives in and gave me some great ideas about where to eat and what to see. He's extremely knowledgable about Stockholm and a very interesting, well-traveled person. The flat is decorated in a very unique and cool way. The curios cabinet in the bedroom was a bit strange to get used to at first, but the lovely bedroom balcony made up for it. 
I didn't spend much time in the flat, as I was out exploring Stockholm or hanging out in Sodermalm bars.
I enjoyed my stay at Gabriel's flat and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to stay in a hip area, not far from historical Gamla Stan.
 "
7505,1137050,33863788,2015-06-01,1130548,Satyam,"Gabriel's place was perfectly located in Soldermalm, surrounded by great restaurants, cafes, and shops.  The place itself is very cool, decorated with an artist's eye, lots of light, and very comfortable.  Gabriel was very helpful as well, made sure we knew our way around and was very available for questions.  I would definitely recommend his place to anyone. "
7506,1137050,43472563,2015-08-20,25868076,Rebecca,"I rented Gabriel's flat in Södermalm's Nytorget neighborhood of Stockholm for 2 months with my mom and my dog, Laila. Gabriel is very friendly - he met us at the door when we arrived and helped us get settled. His apartment is gorgeous - beautiful old wood floors, antiques, lots of books, a real artist's oasis. It worked perfectly for us. The neighborhood is swimming with restaurants, cafes, and bars from yummy and affordable to high end and fancy and  and shops from vintage funky to high-end designer. There are parks and open spaces everywhere. Söder is my favorite island of Stockholm - very old with beautiful 18th century houses and cobblestone streets, and it was great to get to know this part of it. Very hipster, if that is your thing. I'll definitely be back!"
7507,1137050,148160255,2017-04-30,832688,Amy,"Gabriel's apt is a great option for a solo traveller. It is located in a nice area of town, in a well-kept building. The apartment itself is clean, has lots of character, and the kitchen is well equipped for cooking! Communication with Gabriel was always quick & clear. Many thanks!"
7508,1137050,176457561,2017-07-31,72225718,Kurt,Die Wohnung liegt zentral in Södermalm. Zentral aber nicht im Tourismuszentrum und daher fühlt man sich wie ein Stockholmer. Typische schwedische Wohnung in Stockholmer Wohngegend. Umgeben von trendigen Läden und Lokalen. Einen Besuch wert!

Everything was very, very clean!  The kitchen was very well equipped & we ate breakfast there every morning.  Cecilia and her mother went ABOVE and beyond for accommodating us as we were traveling with two very small children. We couldn't believe how thoughtful they were (a travel bed & changing pad for my son & a booster chair for my daughter!  So considerate.).  Communication was very efficient & we get so welcomed. The building was quiet & safe. It was in a wonderful location- walking distance to parks, restaurants, cafes, transit & Old Town.  We can't say enough good this place we called ""home"" for our stay in Stockholm.  Thank you Cecilia for helping us create beautiful memories for our family. "
7511,1139359,171276629,2017-07-17,16216792,Amanda,"Spacious, lovely apartment in a great part of Stockholm. We walked to the subway or train station everyday. The bus stops were also very handy. Groceries, restaurants and shops were all right there.  You are in a city and there can be noise in the evening from people on the street who have been out to bars. That didn't bother us, but some might not like it. There is no bath soap, shampoo or hair dryer, so bring your own. You will really enjoy having such a large, well decorated flat with big, modern bathrooms. We had a great stay!"

The pictures accurately show the apartment and it was extremely clean and a very large open space to stay in. All communications with the host were very easy. It was a perfect stay!
7514,1139359,250219032,2018-04-04,24846686,Nathania,"Maria and her husband have an absolutely beautiful flat. It is in an excellent location, with quite a few grocery stores, restaurants and a subway station within just a couple of blocks. It's also an easy walk to Fotografiska (the photography museum) and Torget at Medborgarplatsen (a square with cinema, shops and restaurants).  It is exactly as pictured, if not better. It's spacious and was incredibly clean. There were five of us: My husband and I, our two children and my mother-in-law and we fit perfectly. Maria was wonderfully communicative throughout the whole process and met us at the flat when we checked in to give us a thorough walk through. She and her husband were very friendly and sweet and even left us a bottle of wine and some chocolates. There can sometimes be a little noise at night from the street below (patrons coming and going from bars) but it was never too bad. We would happily stay in their lovely flat on our next stay in Stockholm. We highly recommend their place."
7515,1144069,4865752,2013-05-29,4606433,Pascale,"We have just arrived from a nice stay in Stockholm where we stayed in this superb apartment; modern, spacious, very clean and equipped with all the necessary commodities.  It is also very well located, only one minute away from the metro which, in turn, arrives to the city centre in three minutes or so.  We were greatly welcomed and all the much needed instructions and information about the neighborhood were provided in a clear and concise manner.  Even in face of a medical emergency the hosts were of great help, even accompanying us to the emergency unit in the city.  A very big thank you for a great stay and experience in your apartment!   "
7516,1144069,5543747,2013-07-05,6131844,Tomas,"Jon is a very good host. He directed us to the apartment and met us there. He gave directions and recommendations to the neighborhood on everything we might need. He even provided us with breakfast. 

The apartment is as described, with a comfortable bed and good kitchen equipment. Since we travelled with a small baby it was very convenient with crib, baby chair and nursing table. "
7517,1144069,5736879,2013-07-14,6766022,Oliver,"I booked Jon's place for my Mum and her partner who was visiting from Australia. They both really liked the apartment for it's space, comfort and the location and really enjoyed their stay, with the city so close by as well as the variety of shops and restaurants in the area. The apartment was very clean and well organised and Jon and his Mum were great at providing instructions and very generous with their time and help. I would recommend Jon's place to anyone."

The location was handy as it was close to transportation, shops and cafes. Jon kindly accommodated our requests for a small family, and our late arrival. As a much appreciated gesture, Jon also got some breakfast food for us. The bed was very comfortable, and at least during our stay it was very quiet at night. The living room was also a good and cosy space. The wireless internet was very fast and worked with no problems. We'd stay there again, and heartily recommend it, in particular for young families."
7519,1144069,8060830,2013-10-14,8051544,Francois,"We really enjoyed staying in Jon and Suann's flat. Great location in Sodermalm. It is only a 2 minute walk from Mellqvist Kaffebar, a delicious coffee / sandwich place; the underground is close by; Drop for coffee lovers is a reasonably short walk; and so on. The flat was clean and spacious, plenty for 3 people (and the couch, surprisingly comfortable to sleep on!). Jon and Susann were very friendly and it was very easy to communicate with Jon to sort out the logistics. I definitely recommend their place and would stay there again next time I'm in Stockholm."

Having a few things in the fridge for our breakfast was very welcome. Jon was there to welcome me and offered suggestions for local eating places, interesting venues etc. It was altogether a successful stay and good to know we could return if we wanted to."

It was very easy to communicate with Jon who was very friendly, letting us know about good shops/ restaurants around the flat.

As we were traveling with our daughter of 14 months old, we really appreciate to be able to use baby chair, nursing table which were in the flat. She could also plays with the little toys of Jon's daughter and that was really nice !

We really enjoyed to be in Sodermalm.

We recommend this apartment !!"
7524,1144069,18258716,2014-08-24,4296635,Miranda,"We had a lovely time in Jon's apartment - it's very nicely laid out and well organised with everything we needed for our stay. The area was also nice and peaceful at night. We were travelling with our baby daughter so it was incredibly nice and helpful of Jon's daughter to lend us her toys/bath/cot/highchair! We enjoyed getting to know Sodermalm and the area around Mariatorget is particularly nice, with good shops and cafés and excellent transport links - it's close enough to the subway but we also walked into the centre very easily. Would definitely recommend a visit!"
7525,1144069,29182569,2015-04-05,28224757,Anni,"We stayed in jon's cozy, bright and well organized flat for two nights. Appartment was clean and quiet, towels and sheets were included and little breakfest in fridge was also a nice bonus. Jon had acknowledged our 1,5 year old daughter by leaving baby towel and blanket, high chair and some toys for her to play with. Flat was well located close to metro station, restaurants and grocery shops. Jon was not home when we arrived but his mum was friendly to admit us to the flat. We appreciated Jon's restaurant hints! Jon's flat met our expectations and I can warmly recommend his place for anyone who visits Stockholm."

This apt is definitely lived in, and that seems to be what many renters are looking for.  This isn't just a property up for airbnb all year long.

It's only a couple blocks to the subway.  Very nice.  Also, not far from Mariongorget.  It
S one subway stop, and there are cute coffee places and more along the pretty grassy square.  Easily walkable from the apt.

Stockholm was great fun!"

Everything was clean, well organized and functional, the kitchen had everything we needed. We didn't meet Jon but he ensured a friend was there to greet us and answer our questions. This would be my preferred place to stay if I am ever in Stockholm again. Thanks Jon!"

7536,1144069,71291522,2016-04-24,5919314,Katie,"Thanks Jon for a super comfortable and relaxed stay in your home!!  

Jon's apartment was immaculately clean, light and warm and really comfortable with cool art work.   It was very close to the underground station and we felt really safe walking around late at night also.   Good hot shower with lots of water too!

Excellent host who met us at the apartment and gave advice on any topic we had. 

He arranged a VERY comfortable double airbed for us also so my friend and I didn't need to share the double bed.  

I loved my stay here because it felt like a proper home and I lived a little bit of a Scandinavian life for a weekend.

Thanks for everything

Kate

Easy to get to the T-bana and surrounded with grocery stores and solid inexpensive food options.

7543,1149820,7383226,2013-09-17,4333363,Keri,"Klara's studio is really bright, stylish and lovely as you see it in the pictures... It's well located in the ""new"" cool area of Stockholm, on the edge of Södermalm. It's in a charming old building, you can see big leafy trees out of the window. Nearby there's plenty of small restaurants, there is a long walk on the river side, a big park and a cute island that you can reach in 5 minutes, walking... If you feel like enjoying the night we found some great local concerts at the river (Email hidden by Airbnb) We really loved Stockholm! Keri and Riccardo 

p.s. One thing: the bathroom is really small and the shower is open, so the water goes everywhere, not a big deal but if I could change one thing this is it I would make it more comfy and user friendly..."
7544,1149820,8453327,2013-10-31,2141054,Didier,"Came to Stockholm for a quick stay of a few days. Klara was kind enough to adapt to my travel schedule to hand over the keys. The room is a bit...spartan, but according to description. If you are a jogger this place is for you"
7545,1149820,8697420,2013-11-12,7829862,Stella,"Small studio well agenced, warm and cute.

Nothing wrong to report, except that our travel was too short and that the weather was not shiny (in november (hahaha)).

Klara gave us the key in the main train station and sent us indications to find easily our place. Don't forget the shampoo ans something too eat in the morning (there is a teakettle, some tea and coffee you can buy it in the subway's shop)

Thanks a lot =)"

We didn't get to meet Klara, but she was very helpful. Maybe some more instructions in the usage of the apartment might be useful, for example where we can bring away the trash... ;)"

7550,1149820,12836524,2014-05-12,946151,Nathalie,"We had a wonderful time at Klara's apartment. Though we flew in very late, Klara was very generous with our ""late-check-in"". This is very much appreciated. The apartment itself is beautiful and the interior is designed the typical Swedish style: simple and elegant. Kitchen is perfectly equipped and when you lie in the bed, you can see the sun set through the window. Obviously the location of the apartment is superb: close to the station of the airport bus shuttle and still in the middle of Sodermalm. Klara will share some local recommendations (cinnamon buns!) which you should definitely try - in fact the best cinnamon buns  we could find. All in all we couldn't recommend enough staying at Klara's place. Thanks for all the help and the great time!"

The only potential red flag was that the advertised rate was lower than actually charged (bummer!) so I recommend double check before booking! "
7552,1149820,13615636,2014-06-01,3410740,Kristin," My husband and I enjoyed a great stay at Klara's place in Hornstull.  She met us at the bus station and gave us keys in person. She provided detailed information about the apartment and recommendations for the area. (The rolls at Cinnamon are delicious!) She also had two city bike passes available for use and it was a great way to see the city! The apartment is small and the shower is not separate from the rest of the bathroom, but we know both of those things going in.  The apartment is also in a great location for running with easy access to a trail that runs all the way around Sodermalm. Overall we had a great stay!"
7553,1149820,13790053,2014-06-04,1824291,Vivian,"Everything went very nice and we had a very pleasant stay at Klara's apartment. She was very nice during all process so when we arrived there were no doubts or concerns. The studio is very clean and had everything we needed for a short stay. It's very close to the subway station, only 5 minutes walking. Pretty close there are plenty of restaurants, coffee shops and grocery stores, and also a small shopping mall. Would definitely recommend to my friends and come back :)"

7555,1149820,14348585,2014-06-17,5737888,Ivo,"We booked this apartment for 3 nights. We met Klara in the city for the keys and everything was fine with checkin/out. Also, Klara provided us with 2 cards for the bike sharing in Stockholm, which was very unexpected but really helpful!
The apartment is as expected. However, we found that there are very few plugs all over the room, so if you depend on them for your laptop phone etc. take a multiplier with you. Also, please note that the bathroom does not have any separation for the shower. Unfortunately, also the bed/mattress wasn't too comfortable for 2 as there are coil springs in the mattress and the mattress kind of ""bent through"" too much; the surface didn't stay even/flat. I can imagine that for ""heavy"" people it might be uncomfortable as well.
We didnt hear anything from neighbours, except for some music in the evenings. other than that it was pretty calm.
The neighbourhood was comfortable. There is a nice restaurant just on the other side of the street a bit uphill that is also doing outdoor concerts and parties in the summer. The place is not far from a Metro station."
7556,1149820,14826904,2014-06-27,5339064,Becky,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Klara's studio for three weekday nights. We spent most of the day exploring Stockholm, so this small space met all of our needs (bed, shower and kitchen for cooking breakfast). The apartment building and surrounding area are calm, and we felt super safe the whole time. Plus, I really loved the clean and minimalist design of the studio. 

The location was quite convenient, too. In less than five minutes, you can walk to the nearest metro stop, which is easy to navigate. Also, Klara let us use her bike rental cards, which was another fun way to see the city. There's actually a bike stand closer to the apartment than the metro. 

Klara was a thoughtful host. She emailed us a document with additional information about the apartment as well as recommendations for cafes, restaurants and grocery stores. (There's a good one right by the metro.) 

If you don't require too much square footage (especially in the bathroom where the entire space basically becomes the shower), then this studio is cozy for a couple and fantastic for a solo traveler. 

Tack, Klara!"

She was very accommodating and met us at the train station to deliver keys and gave great suggestions and directions. The place was perfect for us - very clean and nicely decorated. She even gave us cards to use the City Bikes for the few days, which was awesome. I definitely recommend this place!"
7559,1149820,16130982,2014-07-22,17422783,Francisco,"The apartment was exactly as promised: a small, clean, cozy, stylish studio, perfect for a couple or one person, in a wonderful location (3 minutes from metro station; by metro, 10 minutes to city center). Apart from that, the neighbourhood itself has a lot of interest. And Kara is a kind host, really thoughtful. Everything was smooth and easy. I strongly recommend this apartment. 
"
7560,1149820,17852618,2014-08-18,4424088,Sophie,"A beautiful studio, looks just like in the presentation but even better! Very comfortable. The area, Hornstull, is so nice, you could spend the whole time here and still feel you really experienced Stockholm. Amazing eateries, parks and very convienient with supermarkets etc.  "
7561,1149820,18421472,2014-08-26,12571600,Maria,"I arrived too early to the flat, but I sent her an email and she came in earlier than we had agreed! She had sent me a document with ""usage instructions"" and local recommendations so it was easy to get started.

The apartment was really clean and... might I say it? even inspiring! It was an exercise on minimalism, but a successful one at that. The lift is also something to look at!

It is located in an area which has lots of ""local"" feeling, i.e. it's somewhere where real people live. The island in front (connected with a bridge!) makes for a very nice walk, and it's easy to get to the city centre alias ""tourist central"" in about 30 minutes (depends on how quick you walk). Klara also let me a bike card but I didn't get to use it."
7562,1149820,19029038,2014-09-05,7765283,Marc,"Cute little studio in a quiet neighborhood. Awesome location: you can get anywhere in Stockholm within minutes thanks to the metro station nearby. Getting there from the airport is also very straightforward (there's a direct bus) and Klara was really helpful and easy going. The studio was perfect for my week-long stay, though the kitchen and bathroom were rather small."

I stayed for a long weekend with my husband and t suited us perfectly - it's a great base from which to explore Stockholm as you can get around very easily from the tube station that's very nearby.

We didn't meet Klara as her boyfriend met us at the station to drop off the keys, but she was in regular contact and gave us very clear instructions for how to find the apartment as well as tips for the local area.

I would recommend this apartment to anyone. We had a lovely stay!"

Lägenheten är liten men känns ren och luftig och där finns precis det som behövs. Området kring Hornstull är trivsamt, många bra restauranger och butiker. Det är superenkelt och går snabbt att ta sig hit via centrum med tunnelbanan. Vi rekommenderar Klara och hennes lägenhet varmt."

There is a metrostop a 10 minutes walk away, which will take you all around stockholm. The neighbourhood itself had a few nice bars and restaurants. And there is a small shoppin (Hidden by Airbnb) very closeby (with a h&m and grocerystore). We would definitly recommend this place."

It's in a perfect location with a short walk into Hornstull (and the tube station) as well as being, literally, across the road from the amazing island of Langholmen, which is perfect for a morning stroll.
Klara sent us really useful information about accessing the building and the amenities of the area before hand, which was extremely helpful as it was our first time in Stockholm.
Unfortunately we weren't able to meet Klara on our visit but she arranged to have her friend meet us when we arrived to drop off the keys. Very impressed overall!"

We often had coffee at the Rio Pio theater, and enjoyed the market by the water on Sunday morning. We walked home every day from other parts of the city along the top of Sodermalm, watching the sun get closer to the horizon along montelius vagnus, then making our way to a view point with bald boulders, just over an old factory tower. One other bit of advice: if you see large groups drinking by the water, you should join them! Our favorite days ended at bars and beer gardens along the canal. "
7575,1149820,37805625,2015-07-10,9044519,Christoffer,"I spent three nights in Klara's wonderful studio-apartment with my girlfriend. The listing is nothing short of perfect for couples visiting Stockholm. 
The studio is exactly as seen in the pictures. The flat is beautifully decorated and a shining example of how to decorate a studio apartment where space is limited. 
The flat is located a nice 4 minute walk from Hornstull metro, in a quiet spot right next to a couple of parks. 
Klara was very nice and easy to communicate with. I would not hesitate one moment to book this listing again. Thank you Klara"

Lots of cafes,restaurants  and bars. A few minutes walk to Hornstull station, where there is a supermarket and other shops,  and from there you can get to pretty much anywhere in a few minutes, we didn't use the t-bana much and instead walked and explored. It's a really gorgeous walk from the apartment to the old town by the river, and after having a few drinks in some great bars in 'SoFo' we would walk back to the apartment from there too.

Klara always responded promptly to any questions we had and we felt really welcome, her tips for the area were great, had cinnamon buns for breakfast every morning I was there! Delicious!

Tack!"

I was looking for a place to stay rather last minute and Klara responded immediately where others didn't. Checking in and out went super smooth. Klara's place was nice and cozy like in the pictures (maybe a little darker) and didn't feel small at all due to the smart layout. Location was great close to public transport (airport, metro, local bus) and supermarket all within minutes and nice places nearby to eat in the evening. Kitchen was a little limited for cooking so didn't try that. Did do some lovely walks around Söder and the two smaller islands nearby. You could basically get out into nature right outside the door!"

It is as shown on the pictures. Small but just right for a city trip, clean and very cute. The bathroom is very small, but also clean and ok for a few days once you get used to it. 

The location is perfect!! 3 mins walking to metro station Hornstull / 2 mins walking to a citybike station and a second one not far either / 3 mins walking to Hornstull Market - a must do on weekends / 3 mins to a small ICA supermarket / 2 metro stops to Slussen in the middle of everything / 5 mins bike ride to Hornstull beach.

7608,1149820,474365464,2019-06-23,31687333,Cailin,Klara was a great host. The apartment is cosy and very clean. Great location next to Långholmen park and good independent cafes and restaurants nearby.  Would definitely recommend Klara’s place to friends.

The location is great (there are concerts in the local park you can hear but they end by 10pm), really close to a lovely beach and lots of cafes, shops and bars. It's very close to the metro station as well so there's easy access. Klara was very quick to respond, and we would recommend her and her home to anyone visiting Stockholm!"

Thanks a lot Anna."

We encourage you to choose this address."

Groceries and the metro are nearby and our kids loved the parks in the surrounding areas.   We needed to wash dishes before they were usable and found the beds soft.  Regardless, we found Terry to be an excellent host who responded promptly and accommodated our late check in time.  "
7632,1153177,7333131,2013-09-16,6928891,Edouard,"We had a great stay at Terry's appartment. The flat is large: we were 5, but you could definitely host more people if you put mattresses on the floor. I really appreciated the two large balconies which were a real plus when the weather is as sunny as it was for us. Located in a brand new area about 15 minutes walking distance from the lively Östermalm, and 5 minutes away from the T-bana Stadion, from which you can reach all the central hot spots, you will probably not find better for that price.
Terry was a very kind host. He prepared us a english breakfast when we arrived and gave us a small gift as a souvenir when we left! He's a really cool person, and we had great discussions together.
We really enjoyed our week-end and I can only recommend you to  stay at Terry's for your visits"

Accommodations, kitchen, wi-fi were fine and appreciated. 
The apartment is about 5-10 minutes walk from Gamla Stan. There isn't much immediately outside the apartment. A small grocery was close-by and plenty of dining and ""fika"" options are a short walk."

Flat is spacious, well equipped and wifi is good. Location is perfect as its quiet and free from noise but Yet only 4 min walk from subway. 
Terry was so kind as to have snacks prepared for us on arrival which was awesome since we took the early morning flight from stansted so it was the perfect 'pick me up' to ensure that we Kept our energy up! 
Only thing I will say is apartment possibly could do with some more lighting ( especially in the living room) ..

Thank you Terry!!!"

He was waiting for us upon arrival with a tasty pasta and meat pie lunch that really hit the spot before our first foray about the city.  The apartment is roomy for 4 adults and 1 toddler, who had her own room far enough away she wasn't disturbed by our conversations or we by her crying until she adjusted to the time change. "

He was very prompt in responding to the booking request and later inquiries.  He clearly makes every attempt to accommodate guests. Terry's apartment was exactly as advertised.  It was clean & has all the amenities needed.  It is in a very convenient location, only 2 stops on the metro from the central station, & only a few minutes walk from there.  I can recommend Terry & his apartment without hesitation.  Thanks Terry!!"

Idéalement situé: 3 mn à pied du métro et à 3 stations de la vieille ville, très calme, petit supermarché à proximité. L'appartement est vaste, très clair et agréable.
Nous avons été accueilli très chaleureusement par Terry qui nous avait préparé un bon diner que nous avons partagé ensemble en discutant et nous avons pu profiter de ses conseils.
Merci encore Terry, nous avons passé une excellente semaine.
Roger et Marie-France  "
7646,1153177,14951917,2014-06-30,13117073,Dominique,"I came to Stockholm for a long weekend with 3 friends.  Terry was really friendly and relaxed, and had generously got us some nibbles and offered us a glass of wine when we arrived which was very much appreciated.

The apartment was bigger and better than expected, with three bedrooms, a large bathroom, dining area, kitchen and living room.  There are balconies on the front and back of the apartment as well.  We were provided with several sets of keys so we were able to do our own thing, towels, wi-fi, and access to a computer, so we had Spotify going all weekend and we were able to look up where to go and how to get around while we were there.

The area was really quiet and safe, and within a five minute walk of the underground network which was very easy to use, safe, clean, and reliable.  The location of the apartment was incredible for the city, but also very good for the Friends Arena - we had travelled to Stockholm to see a band playing there.

I can highly recommend the apartment, and Terry as a host."
7647,1153177,15574364,2014-07-12,1028616,Jimmy,"My family and I stayed at Terry's apartment for 6 days, and it worked out perfectly! The apartment was plenty spacious and comfortable for 5 adults, and located in a great area of the city - close enough to walk to the tourist attractions, but remote enough that it was calm and quiet.

Terry was a great host - he welcomed my family with a home-cooked breakfast when we arrived, and answered all of our questions throughout the week. Even when the washing machine broke unexpecedly, he came over and finished and folded our laundry before taking the machine way for repairs. He was charming and conversational with my family, and even broke out his guitar and sang us a couple songs before we left!

Would definitely recommend Terry and this apartment to anybody looking for a great place to stay in Stockholm. Thanks Terry!"
7648,1153177,15689717,2014-07-14,4364872,Rosie,"Terry was a fantastic host, welcoming us with a lovely spread of snacks and drinks when we arrived!  The apartment was fantastic also- a great place to go with a group as there is a big table where you can enjoy meals together, a spacious living area and 2 terraces.  The area is good too- close to the metro and a wonderful big park. "

Ce retard nous a empêché de profiter de l'expérience de Terry qui n'avait plus beaucoup de temps à consacrer à notre accueil. Heureusement nous avons pu le revoir en milieu de séjour.
La situation de l'appartement correspond tout à fait à l'annonce faite par Terry."
7650,1153177,18254976,2014-08-24,10731153,Desi,"Terry was exceptionally responsive throughout the entire process.

We loved the area, near to a great park for running with a lovely supermarket and an amazing bakery close by. You can walk to most parts of Stockholm from here and we found some lovely parks close by for the children. We'd definitely rent this place again. It was very clean and Terry left us milk, juice and water which was great. We even used a few of his tea bags (thanks Terry)!"
7652,1153177,20987930,2014-10-09,1863057,Pj,"Other members of my party arrived earlier than me and expressed how gracious Terry is. He helped them figure out things to do in Stockholm, gave them cake, etc. The place is just lovely, very eclectic. The queen size bed is not the same queen you would expect in the US, more of a double-size. Kitchen is beautifully stocked. Terry left train passes that his guests could fill , just the little things we don't often consider. We felt very comfortable there. Thanks Terry! "
7653,1153177,24465341,2014-12-29,21919164,Colleen,"Terry's flat was exactly as described on Airnb. He was out of the country himself when we arrived but he welcomed us with a nice note and holiday drinks as well as 3 metro passes. 
Our family of 5 enjoyed sitting around his large dining room table playing games and catching up with each other . 
We had to communicate with Terry a couple times and with him also on vacation we weren't sure if would hear back from him. 
We promptly heard back from him and want to thank him for his quick responses to our questions and taking the time from his own vaction to make our stay in Stockholm as wonderful as it was. We would also like to thank his neighbor who also was more then willing to help us.  "

The apartment was perfect for our group. Three good sized bedrooms, large living room to hang out in, and nice dining/kitchen area for meals. The two porches were great too, although a little cold when we visited. The apartment is in a quiet area, but an easy walk to restaurants/bars, the city center, and only minutes from the subway. I would definitely recommend the apartment for a group of friends or a family."

Terry provided easy communication while we arranged our visit and on our arrival he had kindly made a delicious chicken soup for us. The apartment was exactly as described and the perfect size for 4 adults and a baby. Terry even had a pink cot for my daughter! We'd recommend this place to anyone wanting to explore Stockholm as you can explore most places on foot. We'd definitely use again if we returned!

I've only rented condos or homes when I've not stayed in hotels in the past and been expected to launder sheets and towels (or bring my own) and clean the house before leaving. This was a true bed and breakfast and Terry was a true and gracious host. He arranged for a car for us so we had transport to the apartment, then greeted us with an amazing spread of food, including delicious homemade pasta and salad dishes. The kitchen was stocked with all the essentials, as was the bath, should we have needed additional toiletries. He shared all the tips we'd need to get around town, and was responsive when we reached out to him. I would not only stay there again but also stay in other Airbnb properties based on this experience. Terry, you're the best! Thanks again!"
7669,1153177,40918528,2015-08-03,18918157,Barney,"We had a great time staying at this spacious and well located apartment. Terry was a great host and laid on food and beers for our arrival which was a really nice touch. Totally quiet at night so you can get a good sleep, yet only 2 stops from Central Stockholm . Would recommend to anyone looking for a base from which to explore this beautiful city."
7670,1153177,43751811,2015-08-22,31530682,Audrey,"Nous étions 5 dans l'appartement de Terry pour 6 jours. Le bon emplacement du logement (à 5-10min de la gare centrale en transports) nous a permis de visiter tout Stockholm dans les meilleures conditions !
A cela s'ajoute l'excellent accueil de Terry et sa grande gentillesse, nous indiquant parfois des endroits absents des guides de voyage ! Merci encore Terry. Appartement recommandé !

We were 5 in Terry's apartment for 6 days. The great location (5 to 10 minutes from the central train station) gave us the opportunity to visit Stockholm in the best possible conditions !
Furthermore, Terry has been a lovely host with great kindness, pointing out spots that were not even in our guide books ! Thanks again Terry. Recommended apartment !"
7671,1153177,45237211,2015-09-01,29619954,Pat,"Terry was a great host.  He greeted us with a home cooked meal of chicken soup,  fried cauliflower and crisps and left many more sweet treats.  He also did our washing for us.  His apartment is well located and a refreshing walk to the attractions, otherwise very close to the metro and lovely restaurants.  There is also a great market hall.  For a group of 5 persons it was also good to have a separate toilet and wash basin and really enjoyed waking up to hot,  filtered coffee.  The kitchen is well equipped  with everything you need and the place is very secure.  Made our stay  in Stockholm most pleasurable."
7672,1153177,47034844,2015-09-15,18378037,Edwin,Terrys lägenhet i Östermalm är perfekt att upptäcka Stockholm. Det går bra att sova i lägenheten med familj med 3 barn. Lägenheten är nära Djurgården och nära T-bana. Det är faktiskt perfekt! 
7673,1153177,47288296,2015-09-17,3211448,Patrick,"Terry was great, he met us like an old friend and made us feel at home straight away by cracking open a beer. He then took us to the local pub and we hand a laugh over a few more local ales before he left us to it. He'd also provided breakfast and everything we needed for a great stay."

He made us feel completely at home by preparing a delicious lunch when we arrived and provisions in the fridge for breakfast.  The apartment was spacious, very clean and tidy and had lovely terraces at front and back.  It was ideally situated close to the metro, buses and within close proximity to the city centre but nicely tranquil at the same time. We especially appreciated Terry booking taxis for us from and to the airport and his excellent communication skills which made our stay seem seamless.  We felt very much at home before we arrived.  Stockholm is a wonderful city to explore and was only enhanced by staying at this apartment"

It was situated in a peaceful neighbourhood with a supermarket just round the corner. Terry met us when we arrived and had stocked the fridge with all the basics and more (wine and beer!) and he had made us homemade pizza! This was a perfect treat for our two kids after the journey. We loved our stay in Stockholm! 
7680,1153177,53757406,2015-11-12,14479023,Penny,Terry was waiting for us when we arrived in the cab - he couldn't have been more welcoming and helped us with directions...The space is very accurate ad there are many nice home touches such as candles lit when we arrives and a light lunch prepared in advance.

He was full of tips on how to make our stay as enjoyable as possible and allowed us to check out later than check out time as we had a late flight. The apartment was central and conveniently located to get to anywhere of importance either by foot or by the metro. Would definitely recommend this apartment and also anyone who wants to feel safe and secure in Stockholm - Terry's your man!"

The apartment is bright, spacious, and exactly as stated in the description. The apartment is perfectly located, only a few minutes away from the metro station and close to the city. 
Terry is a great host. Unfortunately, I hadn't the chance to meet him as person, as my flight was cancelled. But he warmly welcomed my colleagues, and he even bought cheese for us. 
I would recommend the apartment to other guests. "
7684,1153177,81839347,2016-06-25,2997101,Bassem,A great apartment in fantastic location. Quiet and residential but at the same time super close to public transport and walking distance to the many important landmarks. Highly recommended for a family or a group of friends.

He was a wonderful host and his apartment was perfect for our family of five, located in a quiet green suburb beside local transport and also walking distance to town. We especially liked the balconies for catching the sun morning and evening. We also enjoyed the local restaurant Kouzina and bakery. Thanks for a great stay In your lovely home. "

7687,1153177,87660971,2016-07-21,37916415,Michael,"As we stepped out of our taxi from the airport Terry came across to greet us. This was in keeping with all our dealings with Terry. From my first enquiry, he  replied without delay to all our questions and requests for clarifications.  For our arrival welcome a cooked dinner was waiting and a substantial amount of foodstuffs was in place. When leaving I asked Terry to book a taxi for us to the airport, which he did immediately. Truly a super host.

We were delighted with this accommodation for our 8 day visit to wonderful Stockholm. It is spacious, comfortable, modern and very quiet,  including importantly at night for sleeping. Situated just off the broad Valhallavägen with its grand linear park, it was an ideal base for us. A good supermarket is close by, at the junction of Nybrogatan and Karlavagen. 

We had a marvellous time in Stockholm. We love walking and did much. The nearest metro station is only a few minutes walk but we used it only once, as we did almost all our sightseeing on foot. 

Based on our very positive experiences throughout, on a return to Stockholm we would without hesitation request to stay in this grand accommodation again."

7692,1153177,95094028,2016-08-18,20826649,Ann,Terry met us at the apartment with grilled chicken meal as well as bacon and eggs. He helped us to retrieve the cell phone left in taxi.  Way beyond the call of duty.  Outstanding and responsive host.  Great apartment. Would highly recommend.

"
7694,1153177,98327739,2016-08-30,8795921,Matthew,Terry was a fantastic host and the apartment was everything we needed and more. He welcomed us with food and drinks when we arrived and took the time to help us coordinate ourselves in the city. I thoroughly recommend staying in.
7695,1153177,98990855,2016-09-03,51443466,Masako,"Terry was a great host - we felt so welcomed when we saw him made the apartment so ready for us to relax - with all the candles lit, waiting for us to arrive and gave us a tour, and he even cooked us a dinner because our arrival was later the night. It was so thoughtful and our children LOVED it. The location is great, too. We walked to everywhere - restaurants, cafes, Skansen, and Gamla Stan. There was a good bakery in 1 min walk - we had our breakfast there. I recommend!"
7696,1153177,101074919,2016-09-11,6267890,Sara,Fantastic spacious apartment and Terry was very welcoming. We had a great stay in Stockholm and wouldn't hesitate to recommend the city or this apartment.

The apartment is very comfortable and stocked with everything you need for a comfortable stay. It's very central and only 3-5 minute walk to the Metro. Terry is an excellent host and I definitely recommend this apartment. 
7699,1153177,160884794,2017-06-16,38045981,Carol,"Terry's apartment is spacious and airy with lots of natural light, two balconies and easy access to public transportation, a small supermarket and take away food.  There is a small park area behind the apartment with a fountain, where families gather and enjoy the outdoors.  The apartment is also close to the Royal Music School, and Stadion T-bana station.  For access to food, Eatalia (take away or eat on the patio outside) is excellent and the owners are super friendly and helpful.  There are two very good bakeries nearby.  My favorite is Fosch Patisserie.  They are to the right around the corner from the round apartment building.  Their coffee and pastries are fantastic.  The other, more traditional bakery, ( don't remember the name) is good but only has coffee from a pump carafe.  I highly recommend Terry's apartment for families and/or couples.  Terry kitchen is well stocked and he had food in the refrigerator for us to eat as well as sharing whatever else there was in his pantry.  He made us feel very welcomed when we arrived.  Thank you Terry!"
7700,1153177,162257459,2017-06-20,120120611,Margaretha,"Classy, well-appointed apartment with easy room for five. Close to Stadion T-station and City bike stalls. Two nearby grocery stores, sushi/Thai place across the street. Safe quiet neighbourhood with excellent access to DT and Lidingö. Terry met us at the apartment even though we came in at 2am and he had stocked the fridge with bare necessities AND made us some authentic Swedish toasted cheese sandwiches. He answered and helped with many pre-trip details and was a wonderful unobtrusive yet supportive host while we were there. "
7701,1153177,164483921,2017-06-27,4114144,Kristen,"Terry is a host with few equals. He was very communicative, helpful, gracious, and thoughtful. And his place was roomy, comfortable, well appointed, and perfect for our needs (2 adults and 3 kids under 14). It allowed walking access to Djurgarden and Gamlastan, and easy access to the subways as well. The neighborhood was quiet and people we met there were friendly. We'd stay again for sure!"
7702,1153177,165540266,2017-07-01,7228095,Debbie,"Amazing host! Terry was incredibly gracious and beyond thoughtful and wowed us with a salmon and potatoes brunch with coffee and OJ when we arrived. He also left snacks, milk and breakfast items for our stay. Incredible hospitality and helped set a super positive tone for our time in Stockholm. His place itself is lovely– it was spacious, comfortable, has lots of sunlight, and was very clean. His place is also in a central location and walking distance to the great areas/places in Stockholm - like ferries to the islands, Gamla Stan, the Vasa Museum, the gardens, shopping, terrific restaurants, grocery stores and Saluhall, trains, subway, etc. We cannot say enough to good things about Terry or the apartment.  Thank you, Terry!  "
7703,1153177,168209841,2017-07-09,114212860,Christine,"Wonderful apartment and location. Easy walk to the museums, boat trips, restaurants and cafes in the center of Stockholm. Comfortable beds, great kitchen and dining area, two balconies for enjoying morning coffee and warm cardamon bread from the bakery which is a short walk away. Terry was a gracious host who met us off the metro to lead us to the apartment, had delicious snacks waiting and arranged for our taxi back to the airport. Loved it! Thank you!"
7704,1153177,180079482,2017-08-09,16900139,Jose Maria,"Terry was a great host. He welcomed us with plenty of delicious food and treats for the kids and provided many tips for plans in the city.

The apartment is very nice, just as it looks from the photographs. Area is quiet and very nice with lots of open space and green for the kids. 

We thought from the map that it would be further from downtown, but it ended being closer than we had anticipated. In the end we just walked everywhere and didn't even take public transport any single day.

Highly recommended apartment and host."
7705,1153177,182565846,2017-08-15,118070117,Lynne,"What a unique & eclectic apartment. Located in a beautiful part of town. With the two outside balconies you could enjoy the morning & afternoon sunshine. Plus having both front & back doors open provided a wonderful cross breeze. We highly recommend this place to stay if you are traveling to Stockholm. Our host greeted us upon our arrival and provided lunch. After traveling 13+ hours it was a welcoming sight. Thank you Terry! Sincerely, Lynne Hamilton"
7706,1153177,184194071,2017-08-19,131304305,Yvette,"My family and I spent 14 days touring Scandinavia, staying at 3 different airbnbs.  By far, this was the best place we stayed!  The apartment is spacious and full of light.  It fit three adults and two teenagers quite comfortably.  The two bathrooms came in handy.  Terry  has set up  the apartment so that you feel like it's your own; plenty of space to put your own things in the closets and bathrooms, free access to all the pantry items in the kitchen (fully  stocked kitchen), lots of extra towels, easy trash disposal right outside the door of the apartment, and he even left us prepared food when we arrived!  Very thoughtful.  Terry was a delight- he greeted us at the apartment and walked us through everything and then slipped out.  Couldn't have asked for more.  The location is ideal - very safe area with lots of shops and food nearby  (there is a bakery and an Italian restaurant about 4 minutes away!) and within walking distance of downtown.  Stockholm was by far our favorite city to explore.  The metro stop is just a 2 minute walk from Terry's apartment, so it was very convenient to get around - and to stop back at the apartment mid-day for a rest!  The apartment has two balconies to sit on and enjoy the neighborhood. We were able to save money by grabbing food at the nearby grocery store and preparing our dinners in.  Highly recommend a visit to the Ostermalms Saluhall, a food hall with lots of local food - bakeries, fish markets, and some prepared food ready to take home and eat.  Lovely place and within walking distance.  Can't say enough to recommend Terry's place for a stay in Stockholm!  We really enjoyed it."
7707,1153177,186337682,2017-08-24,19878405,Francois,"Very nice place, very clean, well furnished, convenient. A generous welcome of Terry and flexibility. A place to recommend!"
7708,1153177,188038447,2017-08-28,32685128,Heather,"I have travelled to many airbnbs and this one tops it! Terry was the most amazing super host, greeted us at the door, had candles lit, snacks and wine ready on our arrival, and even serenaded us on his guitar!  The home was so amazingly decorated with both Swedish, British, antique, and contemporary pieces! We were a group of 5 women celebrating a reunion of sorts and we appreciated the two toilets, two hair dryers, loads of mirror space, two amazing decks that had both morning and evening light, and of course an immense supply of clean towels and loo roll (so used to being rationed at other airbnbs of these supplies!)!! The location is perfect, we had quiet rests in the evening and early morning, even with the windows open.  We felt safe walking home at night back to the flat as well.  Great walking distance to yummy brunch places, ethnic restaurants, posh marketplace and of course the water.  Terry's hosting and flat is definitely worthy of super host status!"
7709,1153177,189990340,2017-09-03,7539941,Micky,"Me and my family had a great experience staying in Terry's place. The apartment is even better than the pictures. Charming and cozy, we had everything we needed for our staying.

The location is perfect if you looking to staying close to central area but still wants to have some peace and quiet.  Located in a beautiful and calm residential area, surrounded by parks and small stores that made our stay really convenient. 

As a host Terry couldn't be better. Always quick in answering any doubts we had, he even cooked for us a welcome lunch (that was delicious by the way), which made us feel even more at home at his place."
7710,1153177,192225466,2017-09-10,11867096,Eunju,"Spacious, clean and well-stocked kitchen.  A few extra food items he provided was handy."

7714,1153177,214237695,2017-11-25,153535240,Jordana,"This unit was perfect for our family. There are 3 bedrooms (one with 2 twin beds) which fit our family perfectly. The location is great as it is in Ostermalm (a couple blocks from Stadion underground stop) so you are near everything but it is a quieter part of town. There are amazing playgrounds all over the place. We found a new one everyday. The grocery store, bakery and an italian place are very close by. We were able to eat breakfast and most dinners at the unit which was perfect. Terry was an amazing host. He was flexible, quick to respond, kind and was always available if we needed anything. We would not hesitate to recommend this unit to anyone looking for a fun trip to Stockholm."

Terry met us on arrival, gave us a few tips then was on his way and available via AirBnB text the whole week. We traveled with two small kids and Terry added some nice touches to make our stay more comfortable.
Also nice was the size of the Home, full kitchen, clothes washer, elevator, secured entrance, and two baths. 
The best part about Terry’s flat is the location. It’s so close to everything and easy to get anywhere in the city. Public transportation is a breeze! 
Thank you Terry!"

We travelled with two adults and two youths. The appartment and it’s location was ideal for us. 
We arrived about 02.45 in the morning due to a four hour delayed train. Terry was at the appartment, greeting us, with the refrigerator filled with eggs, milk, ham, juice, jam. Just what we needed after a long journey. 
The appartment is fully equipped and we really enjoyed using the kitchen when preparing several in-house Communication has been flawless both after booking, and prior to arrival and through our stay. 
Terry is the perfect host, and is highly recommended. 
Thanks for making our Stockholm visit a very memorable one!"

7733,1153177,329620069,2018-09-29,106951345,Doug,"Great apartment in a very nice, quiet location, with easy access to public transportation.  Was a perfect place for my colleagues and I to stay while attending a meeting at Stockholm University.  Easily accommodates the number of people advertised.  Well-stocked kitchen, plenty of towels and linen, and balconies that we would have used if not for the brisk weather.

As a great bonus, an awesome bakery is located less than a block away--check out their sublime cardamom rolls (""mumma"" I think they are called).  A modestly-sized grocery store is also very nearby."

The location is fantastic: short walk to the train and restaurants. The neighborhood is stylish and pleasantly quiet. Terry was there to check us in, walk us through the apartment, and provide helpful tips for our stay in Stockholm. He was very accommodating of our early arrival. We highly recommend Terry’s apartment."

7744,1153177,511423356,2019-08-17,110897355,Doreen,Terry is a great host. He is thoughtful and patient. He even gave us a big surprise. His apartment is big and clean. It’s convenient for four girls to stay and cook. It’s near the metro. And just two stations to T-central. We really spend a great time in Terry’s apartment.
7745,1153177,514878384,2019-08-22,5694661,Shaun,"Our wonderful stay in Terry’s apartment began upon check in.  Terry was graciously flexible in meeting us later than we expected due to unplanned changes to our travel itinerary.  When we eventually arrived, Terry was warm and engaging and had prepared a delicious meal for the four of us!  The apartment is in a great location within walking distance of most of the things we wanted to do, and there is a T-Bana station just a couple of blocks away that we used when walking was not the best option.  The check in and check out process was easy and uncomplicated, and the apartment’s amenities were perfect for our needs.  Terry was additionally always timely with his communications, and offered helpful advice.  I would definitively stay here again, and highly recommend Terry’s apartment to others."
7746,1153177,521884506,2019-09-01,75628897,Jan,Terry was great to deal with. The apartment was clean and in a great location. Not enough storage space for our clothes. The beds and pillows were not very comfortable but that can be common in Sweden. And the shower water leaks over half the bathroom floor but again common in Sweden. Overall it is good place.
7747,1153177,526716684,2019-09-09,259442367,Louis,"This is a very nice and quiet apartment located  close to a metro station (a five-minute walk) and then only 2 stations to get to Stockholm Central Station , so we have a very easy and quick access to the main spots in the city. The district in which the apartment is located is very quiet too. The apartment has everything you need, it has three bedrooms with comfortable beds, we really felt well in this place and would like to come back there if we had to visit Stockholm again. Stockholm is a city which is really worth visiting it. Thanks toTerry who was a very friendly and helpful host."

In comparison to other vacation flats that we have rented over the years we found Jenny's to be quite spacious for our family of four.  It was well located - in a quiet neighborhood with cafes and shops and close to public transportation.  It's a short walk to the nearest bus stop which takes you into town and just two blocks from the ferry dock.  One of our favorite experiences was visiting the local lake (just about a mile walk) for a swim where there was also a small beach and a cafe.  Jenny provided us with directions to the lake.

Jenny and her husband were very considerate hosts.  They were responsive over email and helped us reserve time in the laundry room.  Thank you Jenny! "

The location was perfect and we thoroughly enjoyed the free ferry service offered at the dock around the corner from their location. It was very convenient to walk to Old Town and conveniently located near bus stops, as well as many restaurants. Their balcony view toward the water was beautiful. The landscaping around the area was wonderful. We would definitely recommend staying here."

L'appartement est fidèle à la description avec un plus: la terrasse avec un aperçu sur le lac. Quartier très agréable, près du centre ville très bien desservi par un réseau de transports en commun. L'appartement est très clair, très agréable, très spacieux pour nous quatre et situé dans un quartier de beaux immeubles entourés de très jolis jardins.

7755,1156474,41075088,2015-08-04,33229245,Torbjörn,"Jag bokade denna lägenhet för en annan familjs räkning, från Jakarta Indonesien. Vi hade en bra mejlkontakt med ägaren Jenny innan och efter bokningen av lägenheten. Hela ägarfamiljen mycket trevlig och hjälpsam. De tog emot gästerna när de anlände och gav information om lägenheten och dess omgivningar, kommunikationer m.m.

Lägenheten är en ""levande lägenhet"" där folk bor! Den är modern, ljus och ganska stor, ren och fin och bra utrustad. Modern lägenhet i ett nytt område, nära Stockholms innerstad. Ganska stor och mycket trevlig balkong. Närheten till vatten gör lägenheten mycket attraktiv. Sammanfattningsvis allt mycket bra!
"
7756,1156474,41933710,2015-08-10,32182623,Rikko,Thanks for a great stay at your appartment. We felt very welcome and the appartment if great for 7 people - even adults as we were. The owners was kind to help with specific questions regarding our stay in Stockholm. It is easy to go from the appartment to the city. Two stop with the Express bus and you're almost in very centre. I can only recommend the appartment

7759,1158791,9581999,2014-01-03,3848665,Arnaud,"We stayed one week in Alex's appartment. The location is very convenient, it's 10 minutes away from the city center, and 2 minutes away from supermarkets and the subway station.
The appartment is very clean, bright (quiet a good thing when it's dark at 3.00 pm during the winter time). 
Beside this we got some candies as a welcome present, which is a very nice attention from Alex.
If I have to find a small negative thing it would the noise from passing cars in the street. As we are used to have a very quiet environment where we live, we were a bite disturbed by the street noises at the begining, but we got used to it. Beside this the traffic is pretty low, only few cars/buses per hours. 
The appartment can be recommanded without any problem. "

Die Wohnung ist sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet, wir fühlten uns sofort sehr wohl. In der näheren Umgebung gibt es Supermärkte, Bäckereien, Restaurants, Haltestellen für Bus und U-Bahn und City Bike Fahrradstationen. Insgesamt können wir Alex und seine Wohnung weiter empfehlen.

7764,1158791,125696869,2017-01-07,22675401,Kajsa,"This place was excellent and a great location especially since we arrived with train. The bus stopped just outside and the subway was just a short walk away. Lots of shops and restaurants in the neigbourhood. We loved the old atmosphere of the building and the apartment, great interior design too. Nice surprise with the toys which our 4yr old really enjoyed, which made the stay even better. We had a very nice time in Stockholm and Alex was very helpful with giving us the information we needed to make our stay great. We got a lot of snow which we wanted, an amazing holiday for us that usually lives in the cold. We would love to come back and stay next time when we are in Stockholm perhaps then in summertime."

Nicely furnished, fully equipped kitchen and nice little balcony towards the backyard. Our two kids slept in the small room on extra beds, absolutely fine for the stay. The main sleeping room is very big and goes towards the street, but its very calm (esp. as 4th floor). The area is very nice, close to the water, shopping and dining. Would definitely come me back.

We had a good communication before our stay, Maria gave my familie a warm welcome and gave a perfect tour around the house before she left.
The house is fantastic, a real cozy oasis where it is easy to feel at home and relaxed.The weather was wonderfull, so we spent a lot os time in the cozy garden - a true adventure for our kids with all the things to play with.

A wonderful experience ! :-)"
7781,1158893,20897024,2014-10-07,18494456,Magdalena,"AMAZING TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow, that would barely cover just what a fabulous time we had in our Stockholm home. There were six of us, 4 adults (2 couples) and two teens (female) that stayed in the home for 9 days. We had plenty of room for all us. Private rooms for each couple and the two teens. Plenty of bathroom and shower space. We spent a lot of time in the kitchen as most families do, but everything we needed was available. The home included laundry facilities, kitchen ware, towels, BBQ grill, cable TV, apple TV, and plenty of living space for everyone to spread out. The home felt cozy and warm and it was perfect. The bus station is a 5 min walk, with service to the nearby metro station. The metro station is a 10 min walk. Two grocery stores are within 10 min walk in either direction. The host was awesome! He kept in touch weeks prior to our trip providing information about Stockholm and some great sites to visit as well as weather. The host met us the metro station and walked us to the home. Upon arrival we received a tour of the home, a set of keys, an instructions page on the home, and various visitor maps. It felt like we had been long-life friends- it was a great welcome. The listing description was right on and so much more! The neighborhood was fabulous and very safe, very much a middle-class area. We walked many evenings from the various metro stations and bus stations surrounding the home, as well as to and from the grocery stores. We highly recommend this home for anyone staying in Stockholm. It was great staying in a suburb area and riding the metro into the city each day. It was an escape from the hustle and bustle of the city people traffic. "
7782,1158893,24807367,2015-01-03,3516992,Arne,"The House looked exactly like on the pictures. Everything was nicely arranged!

Huset er minst like fint som på bildene - nesten finere egentlig. Alt var bra, både soverommene, kjøkkenet, tv stua og stua nede. Det var greit å komme til t bane og inn til Stockholm. Været var veldig skiftende så utemøblene og Hagen ble ikke brukt. Vi kommer gjerne hjem igjen om sommeren en gang. Stickholm er en utrolig hyggelig by. Vi møtte ikke Dany men alt fungerte perfekt ved ankomst og under oppholdet. Vi var 2 voksne og 4 barn i alderen 6 år til 16 år. "

We were really feeling like at home, and the house was exactly as described on Airbnb site as well as large enough for our family (6 persons). Outside logistical aspect, I would like to make a standing ovation to Dany & Maria. They welcomed us in a perfect manner, and prior our journey, we had many mail exchanges with them.  Very quickly, we were feeling like we knew each other for long time. Many Thanks again, for all kindness and information provided ahead, that made adventure quite easy for us. We really recommend this place to anyone who wants to visit Stockholm."

We were extremely impressed with the prompt response from our host whenever we had a question about the city, or a concern about the house. It was on a quiet cul-de-sac, and felt like an escape from the bustle of downtown, while still being close to everything we wanted to see. If we ever return to Stockholm, we'll look Dani up first!"

We were a group of six and the house suited us very well. 
It was clean and spacious and well equipped.
We enjoyed the garden too and could have happily stayed here without going into Stockholm but we had sightseeing to do.
We would have been happy to stay longer and take advantage of everything the house had to offer.

A large deck in the back yard was an additional plus, the backyard itself was an interesting and pleasant place to be for a gardener like myself. 
Dany was extremely helpful and responsive, communication was clear. he send us lots of helpful information to get to his place and from there it was approx. about a 15-20 min car ride to down town  Stockholm."

The house is spacious and convenient, with all we need for a week vacation. The beds are very comfortable. The garden is very enjoyable. Its location is also convenient for us to drive to the city for sight-seeing. Walking distance to the water side, grocery, and public transportation. There is also a very charming little design store ""Plan 2"" in the villige, which I would recomment. A big thanks to Dany and Maria!"
7792,1158893,44277446,2015-08-25,28926777,Rob,Dany was so helpful and made us feel very welcome.  It was fun experiencing a Swedish home and neighborhood!

7794,1158893,58760268,2016-01-05,31368368,Debra,"Dany is the most perfect and gracious host we have had the experience of working with.  His and his family's home is lovely; clean, comfortable and nicely decorated.  We absolutely loved our stay in Dany's home.
Dany met us at the home, went through everything with us and even helped us order pizza delivery as we had been traveling all day and were exhausted.  He called and ordered taxi pick ups for us on our departing day.  Dany made us feel like we were at home."
7795,1158893,60575201,2016-01-25,32653025,Marta,"Dany's house is amazing, so comfortable and cosy! The location is quite good, 10 min. walk from the nearest metro station and in a quiet nice neighborhood. I only regret having come in winter and not having been able to use that beautiful garden of his. Dany was very nice and helpful to us and our stay was just perfect. Highly recommended!"
7796,1158893,61321249,2016-02-02,54739511,Pak Kin,Thank you for sharing your lovely home.   The welcome pack was useful and comprehensive.   Our flight was delayed and we missed our connection in Doha and arrived in Stockholm one day later.   Dany the host was very kind to accept a last minute change to stay only for one night instead of two and gave us a refund.   Thank you.
7797,1158893,64772757,2016-03-08,15063997,Ling,"this is a really home in my long vacatio. everything is good, more than image.
thank you, deany! I will back on summer .
超级可爱有品味的一栋房子,4间卧室,两个浴室和厕所,离车站有点远,走路15-20分钟,车站边有个不小的超市｡比起瑞典的高房价,这个价格对家庭旅行者来说不能更赞,从一开始房东就非常友好的推荐我当地的玩乐和美食｡
厨房里锅碗瓢盆调料咖啡茶包一应俱全,还有太太亲手准备的各种说明｡唯一的缺点大概是洗澡烧水一次最多两个人,人多了就要等等｡浴室甚至有桑拿房｡"
7798,1158893,67367481,2016-03-29,26372450,Annalinda,"Very beautiful experience in Dany's house! We were in 9 people, all adults, and our stay was very confortable. The house is fantastic, large, super-equipped and is a 15-20 minutes walk from the metro station. Dany was a very kind host with us. Strongly recommended!"
7799,1158893,74382898,2016-05-15,34166711,Ellie,"We really loved our weekend spent at this house! The house itself is absolutely beautiful, lovely furnishings and a great homely feel. We really felt like we were experiencing the ""real"" Stockholm. The house is in a lovely quiet neighbourhood and Dany was really thorough in giving us directions to the house from Stockholm centre. It was really easy to find (even at eleven o'clock at night with a suitcase) and was a great base for going in and out of Stockholm using the Tunnelbanna. Dany even told us how to get a travel card which we used for our whole journey.  

Even though there were 6 women all staying in the house, there was plenty of space and all of the facilities accommodated us really well, the shower room was lovely and the upstairs living space was great for sitting and chatting. Dany was a fantastic and attentive host, he really tried to make sure we got the most out of our trip, providing me with suggestions for places to visit and eat in Stockholm (we took his advice and went to a restaurant called Luzette, which was lovely) and also helping us to find the best way to travel from the airport. We had a fantastic trip and staying here played a big part in how much we enjoyed ourselves!  "
7800,1158893,76748111,2016-05-29,54817942,Angelika,"After booking Danys house he sent me a lot of very helpful emails with sightseeing and shopping tipps and a very, very detailed map to find his house and the next coop market. Unfortunately my plane had a 3 hours delay so I didn't meet Dany in personal, but he welcomed the other members of my family very warmly - they were totally excited about his kindness and his helpful tipps. The house was perfect - we felt very comfortable and had some really wonderful days there. Also Dany was not angry at all, although I texted and called him at 10 p.m. the day before we left Stockholm. I want to thank Dany and his wife Maria and can totally recommend the house, there was plenty of space for the 5 of us and I would love to come back someday."
7801,1158893,78462808,2016-06-06,23615542,Catherine,"Nous avons passé un super séjour (3 nuits) dans la maison de Dany et Maria.
Cette maison est vraiment pleine de charme et très bien équipée avec un jardin très agréable. 
Elle est située à une dizaine de minutes à pieds du métro : ce qui permet d'aller facilement dans le centre de Stockholm et de rentrer le soir au calme. 
Dany nous a donné toutes les informations utiles. Nous nous sommes sentis les bienvenus.
Pour notre première visite en Suède, c'était une très belle expérience."

7803,1158893,82513245,2016-06-27,6219229,Brigitte,"Our stay at the Quiet Oasis near Central Stockholm was absolutely fabulous. We found a very cozy, spacious, practical and super clean house in a quiet neighborhood. Dany had given us very helpful information before our arrival and he and his wife helped us out with delicious food since we arrived on a public holiday and had no chance to find an open supermarket. We contacted Dany several times with questions and he always answered immediately with helpful hints and suggestions. We loved sitting outside on their porch, enjoying the garden and birds and enjoyed cooking in their fully equipped kitchen.
Dany, his wife and kids are superb hosts and we appreciated very much being able to stay at their perfect house. Thank you again to the whole family for this very pleasant Swedish experience!!!!"

"
7805,1158893,91111280,2016-08-03,14604072,Sarah,"We had a great time staying at Dany's place in Stockholm.  The 4 bedroom house was as described in the profile and very comfortable for 8 adults.  It was also great having two bathrooms.  The house had everything you need, including a washing machine and dryer and overall was comfortable.  Dany was extremely helpful before our stay providing tips for our visit and advice about various attractions.  His instructions for finding the house and to get to and from the tube were really good and overall, he could not have been a more helpful host.  Thank you Dany.  "
7806,1158893,92610687,2016-08-09,12915025,Judith,"The House was as discribed and I can recommend it as the best Choice to Stay with a Family or Group. You find everything you Need in the House, it was superclean and we enjoyed the huge Terrace and Barbecue in the Garden.
Dany was easy to Communicate with and he sended youseful information about the House, transportation and things to do in the neighborhood before arrival. This was really perfect for Planning in Advance!
Thank you Dany and your Family for Lending us your house - we really felt ""at home""!"

7808,1158893,97884956,2016-08-28,42868095,Xiaoping,"The house is located in a lovely county, with very nice local beach and we even can take the 1902 steam boat to city center and had a steamboat tour which is a such bonus during our trip. The house itself is very lovely nice garden, very cozy rooms upstairs, decorated with great taste arts. Dany is Singh a great host he prepared an amazing house guide with everything in detail. It is like a complete tour guide from local people. We really enjoyed the time there and really appreciate all that Dany did to help us. Thanks! "

We arrived on the 22th of October with a group of 10 (my family). It's easy accessible with the metro. Their are plenty of grocery stores in the surrounding, and it's a quiet and peaceful neighborhood. The house is more then perfect. It's clean, cozy and Dany has a good taste of the house decor. Overall Dany is easy to go with, he always wants to help you, and the house is all you need. Thanks Dany!"

Upon arrivals, Dany and Maria provides us plenty of helpful information about Stockholm and the area nearby. Communication was swift and they're always ready to help when we'd questions. "

Bien aménagée la maison à un beau jardin, qui a été apprécié par les enfants! Un seul ""défaut"", la maison est un peu loin du centre, avec les enfants il faut compter 15' à marcher et 15' en métro. Ce qui peu faire beaucoup sur un Week-end. Mais sinon très bien! Merci beaucoup à Danny pour toutes les informations sur la ville et les restaurants. "
7817,1158893,155336386,2017-05-28,5850229,Annick,"Nous étions sept à loger chez Dany et dès notre arrivée nous nous sommes sentis comme ""à la maison"". Dany a rejoint sa résidence à la campagne et nous a laissé sa maison comme s'il y était - rien à voir avec une location classique sans âme.
Visiter Stockholm ne pose aucun problème : la station de métro à 15' à pieds vous amène dans tous les endroits de cette ville à taille humaine que vous souhaitez visiter. Tout est accessible ...même en chaise roulante.
Bref nous avons passé un long week end superbe et remercions Dany pour ses conseils avisés.

Dany did everything he could to help us enjoy the Stockholm area with info on attractions and transportation. Quiet neighborhood with room for kids to play.

7821,1158893,175070896,2017-07-28,95653604,Raf,Comfortabel en groot huis met alles er op en er aan in een rustige en veilige woonwijk van een randgemeente van Stockholm. De metro en supermarkt zijn op 15 min lopen. Vriendelijke eigenaar die je van heel veel info voorziet. Goede en snelle communicatie en prima waar voor je geld in een grote stad als Stockholm waar een hotel dichter bij het centrum veel duurder en kleiner is dan dit. Echt aan te raden.
7822,1158893,177200477,2017-08-02,17368164,David,"Dany's house is a perfect base to explore Stockholm for a family or group. Short trip on tunnelbana takes you to all places of interest and station only about 1km from house.
Dany is an incredibly helpful and generous host, providing loads of information and making check in very easy. 
House is spacious and well equipped. Lovely garden area to sit out.
I would definitely recommend Dany as a host and his house for your trip to Stockholm."
7823,1158893,178664414,2017-08-06,119400720,Andreas,"Es war einfach toll. Angefangen von all den Informationen im Vorfeld über Sehenswürdigeiten, Tips über Restaurants und Orte die man aufuchen sollte über die perfekte Dokumentation, um zum Haus zu finden. Selbst als wir da waren wurde gefragt on alles in Ordnung sei oder ob man noch etwas brauche. Das Haus hat sofort zum Wohlfühlen eingeladen und jeder, immerhin fünf erwachsene Kinder und die Eltern, hat seinen Platz gefunden zum relaxen oder zum Plaudern. Einfach herrlich. Dass das Haus sauber und gepflegt war erklärt sich von selbst. Fazit: Toller Platz, um mit einer Familie einen winderschönen Urlaub zu verbringen und tolle Gastgeber."
7824,1158893,184562489,2017-08-20,71306988,Salvatore,"Una bella casa, molto curata, in un quartiere tranquillo. Comoda la posizione, vicina alla metropolitana e alle autostrade. Siamo stati accolti benissimo. La consiglio!

La maison est vraiment très agréable et parfaite pour un groupe de 8.
Marche de 15-20mn pour aller jusqu'au métro. Un bus fait le trajet mais il ne fonctionne plus à partir de 18h30...à savoir si on est chargé.
Nous avons vraiment passé un excellent séjour !"
7826,1158893,192724883,2017-09-11,55573173,Nimit,"Great home to stay in when in Stockholm. 

We stayed here as a group of five friends to attend a cycling event. Dany went out of the way to make the trip memorable. He even left out tools for our bikes

House is in a quite residential area which is easy enough to get to. It's about 10 mins walk to Tunnelbana and has parking if you are renting a car. 

The place is clean and very homely. Kitchen is well equipped which makes breakfast an easy job and then you are ready to have a fun day. 

We were arriving late at checkin and Dany had left enough stuff in kitchen sufficient for five people to have breakfast. 

Overall we had a nice stay."
7827,1158893,197295781,2017-09-25,44752394,Peter,"Lovely house in delightful neighbourhood, an easy T-bana ride from the centre of Stockholm (15min walk to house from closest station).  Everything thoughtfully provided and explained. Unbelievably clean!  Beds comfy. Welcoming lights on when we arrived (some on timers,  including garden lights).  Friendly email communication with Dany before and during our stay. Just a lovely place to stay.  Sorry we couldn't have stayed longer. Thanks for sharing your home!"

Clean, spacious & well equipped. Dany is a great host, he prepared nice introduction to both his home & Stockholm and also the snack & breakfast for our stay. We got a wonderful holiday for our first visit to Sweden. Thanks a lot."
7831,1158893,262235060,2018-05-08,52295609,Ulrika,"Cannot give enough stars to Dany and Maria as Airbnb hosts! Super communication, super quick responses,  and loads of tips and extra useful info. House is amazing, with an even more impressive garden with BBQ (which we could use and Dany even left charcoal for us!) and lots of fun for kids (trampoline and swings). Dany was so helpful and really did everything to make us feel welcome, we got to borrow high chair and crib for our 18months old, and he even prepared breakfast and treats for us. House is in a one way street so super quiet and with soo comfortable beds we all slept like babies (including the baby :)
Would love to come back and will certainly recommend to friends!"
7832,1158893,276927362,2018-06-15,175663623,"Mary ""Crispy""","Dany and Marie’s home is a true treasure. Quiet and peaceful. Ecelectically furnished and super comfortable. Lovely back yard.
The configuration of the home was unusual but we all had our privacy and that added to the charm.
We cooked on the barbecue, washed clothes, and enjoyed the sunshine in the backyard.
I wish that our time had been longer than 3 days.
Our ages ranged from 61 to 85. We don’t like stairs. We kept our suitcases down stairs and we did not consider that an inconvenience, with the bedrooms being upstairs."
7833,1158893,292118997,2018-07-17,60687823,Abhishek,"Our stay at Danny’s place was really pleasant especially because of his house. It’s pretty, cozy, warm and welcoming. Loved the tiny details/ decor throughout the house. However, our only disappointment was the location of the house which we did not really have an idea as we were unfamiliar with the locality. We didn’t initially think walking 1.5 kms approx up and down to reach the nearest station will be a problem. But after a whole day sightseeing, it was physically draining to walk back another 20 mins to reach home. Otherwise Danny was extremely welcoming and an amazing host and helped immensely with our outdoor plans. I certainly recommend his place if you keep the location in mind."

7836,1158893,318673047,2018-09-04,190474826,Kristin,"My family loved our stay at this house.  We had two toddlers with us and the yard was just perfect for them to run around and enjoy.  They spent hours on the trampoline and really enjoyed eating fruit and veggies straight from the garden.
Dany was a wonderful host, gave us a ton of helpful information for our stay, and really made us feel like the home was ours.  It is about a 15 minute walk to either of the 2 convenient train stations, but we did it a number of times with strollers and it was no problem at all.  The beach is about a 25-30 minute walk, but it was very cute. 
We would absolutely recommend this house to families hoping to explore Stockholm and still experience all the comforts of home.  We had an amazing time!"

7838,1158893,344714496,2018-11-04,209799073,Ariana,"I decided to celebrate my birthday in Stockholm with a group of 7 friends. I chose Dany's house for our staying in Stockholm (3 nights) and it was the best decision of the entire trip. The house is amazing; all of us loved the space, especially the backyard and the living rooms. The bedrooms are amazing and the master bedroom's bed is like sleeping in heaven. The house is simply gorgeous and luxurious. The house has everything you need for a comfortable staying and makes your life easier when staying in a house that has everything at your disposal.
I would like to leave here a special thank you to Dany, who thought about all the small details to make our staying very pleasant. In addition, he helped me with everything, providing me with all kind of information useful for my first visit to Stockholm. 
I do not have enough words to thank him for everything. Great house and even greater host. We love this house and definitely recommended 100%. 
Thank you so very much Dany :D 
All the best wishes,

7841,1158893,421781203,2019-03-10,54844564,Alexander,"Danny’s place is awesome for a retreat in Stockholm. It is convenient for 6-8 people, the bedrooms on the second floor are comfortable and neat. The first floor provides the social area that is special enough, yet cozy and warm. It is not walking distance from the center, but the subway station is near enough and the trip to gamla stan takes about 20 minutes. BBQ is a great addition to the house, we had delicious steaks in the evening.
Dany himself is an awesome dude, very welcoming and responsive. He provided us with all necessary information and then some. My group of friends and I really appreciated an opportunity to visit Dany’s place and Stockholm."

The house was beautifully decorated with lots of space to relax and play (my 6 year old especially loved all of the LEGO!). Dany and Maria provided us with a ton of information about the house and the area, responded quickly to any questions, and left really thoughtful items for us to use (snacks and staples in the fridge) after our long flight. 

We would not hesitate to stay here again! Highly recommended."

The house is lovely and comfortably fit our group - they thoughtfully left us snacks and things for breakfast. It’s in a quiet location and you can reach central Stockholm in about half an hour. Would highly recommend for larger groups.

We had 10 people (6 adults and 4 kids) staying here and there was plenty of room. We loved having two showers and two sets of washers and dryers. Dany helped answer all of our questions and was open to giving us ideas on where to eat and what to visit. We would stay here again. Dany was an excellent host and we wished we had more time to explore Stockholm.

7852,1166419,8908493,2013-11-25,7379447,Carlos,"Nice apartment. 
Pretty good location 10 minutes from downtown. Centralen Station by subway the ideal way to move around, four blocks from the local station and only 3 stations to downtown.
Ideal for three people, four is a little too optimistic unless is a short term, the one bath is a bit of a problem.
Well equipped.
Nice neighborhood."

7864,1170027,5089837,2013-06-11,1976870,Makedonka,"My husband and I spent a lovely weekend in Stockholm, begging of June, accommodated at Diana's apartment. 

Diana is a kind person; was very responsive and answered all my questions during the booking process. 
At the day of arrival, she welcomed us in the apartment, left the key and also some food for breakfast. Then, at the end of the stay she came back to pick up the key, at exactly appointed time.

The apartment looks just as described and shown in the pictures -  small, but well organized; fairly clean and the internet connection worked out perfectly. It is well suited for two persons, and a kid would fit perfectly :) (Yes, I missed my little son a lot, there was a spare bed in the room and a wonderful playground in front of the building). The apartment is located in a nice surrounding, 3min walk from the subway and about 20min ride to the city center.

Stockholm is a fascinating city. I will surely visit it again and I won't hesitate choosing Diana's flat again. "
7865,1170027,5235301,2013-06-19,6770885,Margit,"I rented Diana's apartment for my parents, who are hopeless with computers, so I did not see it, but they LOVED it!  They said it was spotlessly clean, fully furnished and equipped with everything they needed, and in a perfect, VERY quiet, convenient location, very easily accessible to transportation and shopping for all necessities.  It took them about 20 minutes to get into the center of Stockholm.  The kitchen was well stocked with equipment, and there were two huge supermarkets right near the station.  The apartment faces a grass courtyard, so the view was peaceful and lovely.  My mother, who is quite particular and fussy, said, ""It could not not have been better, and we could not have been happier with the accommodations.  Diana was so organized, was always exactly on time to meet us, was so lovely and helpful, and could not have been nicer.  We wanted to stay an extra night, and Diana was so accommodating and made it possible.  We just loved everything about our stay in her apartment!  When we return to Sweden, we hope her apartment is available so that we can stay there again."""
7866,1170027,5317715,2013-06-24,6213264,Vanessa,"Fantastic apartment, only a few minutes walk from the subway station. Only 20 minutes from Central Station. Lovely balcony & fully equipped kitchen (inc Coffee Maker). 
We used the pull out bed from the sofa as it was a Double - this was very comfortable & easy to fold away during the day - there is also a single bed in the apartment. Met Diana on our last day in Stockholm, she was extremely helpful & very quick to reply to our messages throughout the whole Airbnb experience. 
Thanks so much :) "

The location is quiet but very close to transportation and basic shopping. Diana was out of town when I arrived so I was greeted by her mother, who showed me around the apartment. The kitchen was stocked with some basics including, coffee, bread, margarine, cheese, and milk. Diana checked in with me to see how things were going around the middle of the week.  I would definitely recommend Diana and her lovely apartment!"

This is a quiet neighborhood and we can get rest at night well. I think the only one thing that bothered me a little bit was that if other people slammed the main door at the first floor, I could hear that.   "
7879,1170027,14441237,2014-06-19,12994729,Adam,"Diana's place was perfect for our few days in Stockholm. We didn't get a chance to meet Diana but her father greeted us and was very welcoming. The place itself is just as described - good bed, very comfortable sofa bed as well, and Diana was so nice even providing some much needed food for us after 30 hours of traveling. 5 minute walk to the metro, 20 minutes to the city Center. Fantastic. "
7880,1170027,26267206,2015-02-08,26613205,Per,"Jeg har kun roser at sige om Diana's lejlighed. Jeg kom fra Danmark og landede først i lejligheden kl 2 om natten hvor Diana og en veninde tålmodigt havde ventet på mig i timevis. De havde guidet mig gennem nattens snefaldet gader over telefonen. Selvom jeg var så sent på den var Diana sød og imødekommende.
Oveni havde hun købt brød, kaffe, juice mm. så jag havde lidt til om morgenen når jeg vågnede. Lejligheden var ren og lækker, en hyggelig lejlighed, der kunne rumme 3 mennesker uden problemer.
Næste gang jeg skal til Stockholm ved jeg hvor jeg skal bo"
7881,1170027,29686733,2015-04-11,136152,Sabina,"We had a lovely time in Diana's flat. Diana was always available, she welcomed us with a nice breakfast assortment, we really enjoyed our stay. The apartment is at the most 5minutes walk to the subway, on the main metro line which took us in the center
 of Stockholm in less than 15minutes. "
7882,1170027,32137929,2015-05-14,32434058,Artur,"Diana was a very kind and thoughful host. 
The neighbourhood is quite, charming and not far from the centre.
The apartment was nice and clean just like in the photos.
The location is very convinient with a subway station and grocery store within walking distance.
I would definetly recommend Diana's apartment to anyone who is passing through Stockholm."
7883,1170027,35501368,2015-06-19,1451078,Nacim,"Very clean apartment, well furnished, 5-6 minuts from metro which is 12 stops (20 minuts) from central station.
Quiet neighborhood, not lively but for the price it's a better value than hotels (which are expensive in Stockholm).
Excellent contact with Diana.

Recommended!"
7884,1170027,36313936,2015-06-27,25000579,Paul,"While I did not meet Diana, only spoke to her via phone, she is a great host, attentive and communicates well.  Her father checked me in and he is also reliable and attentive and ensures that you have a good stay.      The apartment is clean, modern, in a good neighbourhood, close to grocery stores, metro, etc -  approx 20 minutes from the city centre - I would stay here again!"
7885,1170027,40421861,2015-07-31,4595079,Vicki And Bob,"We spent a month at Diana's apartment and it was a great experience.  Both Diana and her father Avi were gracious, helpful hosts.  The location of the apartment is in a suburb of Stockholm, quiet, and in a charming park-like setting, with lots of families and children.  Once we figured out the shortcut, it's only a few minutes walk to the metro station.  The metro is on a street filled with shops, including 3 supermarkets, a produce market, a couple of restaurants and cafes.  From there, it's a direct 20-minute metro ride into central Stockholm, so it was very convenient.  However, when we first arrived it was very difficult to find the apartment since the layout of the buildings is quite confusing.
In addition to a comfortable single bed and an equally comfortable sofabed, the apartment is nicely furnished, including the very pleasant balcony overlooking the trees.  The kitchen was extremely well-equipped with everything we needed to make virtually all our meals, and Diana left a great deal of food for us.  The Internet worked perfectly.  There is a washer and dryer available a few buildings away and you can schedule a time slot in advance which was helpful.  Overall, we enjoyed our Stockholm Airbnb experience very much."
7886,1170027,74733056,2016-05-16,19311342,Dariel,"Diana was very kind with us and when we arrive she gave us some bread, cheese and ham to prepare some sandwiches, was very  convenient when we arrive hungry. 
The apartment is lovely and the building is very quiet, excellent to rest at nights, is very close from the train station and supermarkets, restaurant etc. We really enjoy our time in this place. "
7887,1170027,78024832,2016-06-05,16401067,Rachel,"Diana was a great hostess! Unfortunately I wasn't able to meet her in person, but she was very accommodating when it came to checking in/out. Her father was very sweet and called us a cab for the airport which was also very helpful. I would definitely recommend staying at Diana's, very comfortable and perfect for four friends staying in Stockholm. The train is super easy to get to and it's a safe neighborhood. 15 minutes by train to get to center Stockholm, worth getting a pass if you're staying for the week. Overall, great city, great trip."

7891,1170669,471396085,2019-06-17,69472079,Stefanie,"Jennie's place is an oasis if you need down time from constantly traveling. About a 10-15 minute walk from the train station, you get to see suburban Swedish life in action around you. Jennie was nice, quick to respond, and has neighbors that are willing to answer any questions should you just need to be shown something. We had no trouble finding the place and enjoyed our down time there. I highly recommend this place for a family or larger group!"

She responded very quickly to my messages and was coordinated with me to arrive at the apartment early in the morning which was when I arrived from Chicago.  She was helpful with arranging for us to do laundry (which we did not end up doing, but nonetheless she arranged it for us), and letting us use her printer to print our plane tickets since she lives just downstairs.  The apartment was perfect for our stay in Stockholm; great view and bright and airy.  Recommend you stay here!"

But moreover this is a hearty place where you can absolutely feel like at home.
Annika was really nice and helpful. We had a fantastic time in Stockholm and staying at this studio was a good part of it.
We had such a good time that we are already loonking forward to stay in the same place next time we will visit Stockholm next spring.
We  totally recommend Annika's place! great experience!"

7901,1170766,8809997,2013-11-18,9836943,Barış Evren,"Annika is very good, kind, calm and helpful person. Her house is very cute, clean and big terrace room. The room is decorated white colour and it is shiny, which i like. Both side of the room is covered with windows (also there are roof windows). In house you can find everything you need. There is a small kitchen with oven and refrigirator. Location also good, bus, subway and train station are close to house. You can go Gamla Stan (Old city) by walk. In the corner there is a supermarket and lots of restaurants, bars and... It was our first Airbnb experience. And we really like the system. When we come to Stockholm, wish to stay again Annika's house again."
7902,1170766,9065825,2013-12-03,10298926,Ida,Annika was a perfect host . Everything was nice and clean. Good information and follow up.

There is everything you need to stay. It's a pleasure to come back there after the long walking around Stockholm. Annika was very friendly and gave us all the nessesary instructions and stuff. It was the first time we stay in Stockholm and we got only pleasent impressions and memories. We would love to come back again! (Valeria and Dmitriy)

The studio itself is exactly how it looks like on the pictures. With a very comfortable bed, sheets and towels, TV, wireless internet connection etc. Perfect for a short or long stay in Stockholm (I stayed for 8 weeks). Located near Mariatorget on Södermalm you have access to the red metro line and different busses for transport in the city.
I definitely recommend staying at Annika's place - you will love it!
"
7905,1170766,12479349,2014-05-03,1809119,Katja,"I had the great pleasure of staying at Annika's studio in Stockholm. My trip was arranged in the last minute, so I had very little time to plan my stay. Luckily Annika responded very quickly to my request and was able to accept my request and receive me all within the same day! Communication was swift and easy and the studio itself is really nice, bright and clean, with a little kitchen so you can prepare yourself some lunch or dinner and enjoy it on the terrace in the sun!
Location is also great - at Mariaberget - within walking distance of everything, and if you prefer to take the metro, you will find Mariatorget station just two blocks away.
Access from the airport is super easy as well. 
If you are thinking about staying at Annika's - don't hesitate, it is a great base to stay at when you are visiting Stockholm!"

The room has plenty of light, a nice patio, and a comfortable bed. It is located in a great part of Söder with many grocery stores, restaurants, and shops very close to the apartment. The Mariatorget station is just a short walk from the rental, providing quick access to Gamla Stan (2 stops) or the city (3+ stops). I can't recommend Annika's place enough in an area that has quite expensive hotels!"

7913,1170766,16210539,2014-07-23,16495553,Ge,"Annika is een vriendelijke gastvrouw.
Zodra wij aankwamen vertelde zij dat het moeilijk is de ruimte te verduisteren.................Helaas klopte dat!
Overdag is het een fijne lichte studio, met transparante rolgordijnen voor de openslaande deuren naar het balkon en met verschillende ramen in het plafond.
Vanaf 04.00 wordt het daardoor helaas dan ook al heel erg licht.
Als je gewend bent in een donkere kamer te slapen, kun je beter vanuit thuis slaapmaskers meenemen.
Wij waren in juli (heerlijke 27 graden)te gast. 
Aangezien het een zolderstudio is, zou ventilator fijn zijn geweest.
De locatie is prima. (bv 15  minuten te voet naar Gamla Stan)
De wijk is gezellig, met winkels (open van 7-23) en horeca en mooie picknickplaatsen op loopafstand."
7914,1170766,16742248,2014-08-01,18308434,Mose,"We enjoyed very much our week-long stay in Annika's flat. It's a large loft-like room with all facilities and a terrace. The flat is located  in an spacious attic which has been recently modernized and equipped. It's very bright with windows in two directions (east and west). 
The building is a 3 storey building without elevator but the staircase is comfortable and we didn't find it difficult to climb the steps to the flat.
Location couldn't have been better: in the trendy part of Stockholm, Södermalm, close to shops, restaurants, and transport (buses and underground) but still quiet and near to parks and lake Mälaren. The neighbourhood has plenty of beautiful classified buildings.
Communication with Annika works very well and she is very helpful. We would definitely like to come back to her flat."

Das Zimmer ist sehr freundlich eingerichtet, alles war sehr sauber und Annika war überaus freundlich und hilfsbereit! Wir können diese Unterkunft wärmstens weiterempfehlen und kommen gerne wieder!"
7916,1170766,17960806,2014-08-19,19034806,Mira,"Annika's studio is great! Firstly,
it's well located, you can reach everything by foot and enjoy scenic routes. (Plus, just down the road is the best ice cream parlour in Stockholm!)

Secondly, the apartment itself has all you need for a couple of days and you won't need to turn on the light since the many windows allow it being naturally lit. Annika was there when I arrived and explained everything to me. She's got plenty of maps in the apartment and was happy to point out good places for swimming etc. 

I greatly enjoyed my stay and will try to stay at Annika's when I come back to Stockholm!

She is so helpful and take care of his tenants. The flat is exactly as shown in the photos, it has a little kitchenette so useful for having breakfast and diner. (we didn't had lunch there because we were out).
The location of the flat is great! Is in a walking distance of the biggest attractions, the underground is 5 minutes and you can go everywhere so fast.
The neighbourhood is calm, but just in  a short walk you can have lots of restaurants and bars, and it has great views of the city."
7918,1170766,18700867,2014-08-30,11875453,Astrid,"Annika's flat is beautiful, very clean and perfectly located. It is very bright and light, and it felt wonderful to wake up with so much brightness above the roofs of downtown Stockholm. Annika was very prompt in arranging the flat for us and very thoughtful is anticipating our needs. Loved the place, will come back!"
7919,1170766,18907448,2014-09-02,20060042,Bjoern,"We stayed 3 nights in this nice studio. It's perfectly located (4 min to Metro, 3 min to direct Bus to Gamla Stan and the ferries). The area Södermalms is very cosy and has lots of nice bars and little restaurants. The studio is very bright, windows on 2 sides, and we enjoyed breakfast on the little balcony. Annika was very friendly and helpfull and organisation was reliable and fast. Thanks for the nice stay!!"
7920,1170766,19207276,2014-09-08,19210664,Sara,"Mine forældre lånte Annikas bolig og satte stor pris på både lejligheden, som de har beskrevet som vældig rar, lys og med massere af plads. Beliggenheden var ideel og Annika var meget imødekommende og venlig."

and provided all that was needed.  I would recommend this home and the location was great!  Two places with high levels to observe the sunset within close walking distance. Three restaurants within a few blocks; the Magnolia, Tehran, and Tabbouleh.  Magnolia has a happy hour where you get a beer or a glass of wine with small open face sandwiches for 65 kroner!"
7923,1170766,19845063,2014-09-19,7165036,Michel,"Great place in a Very Nice neighbourhood, our host was charming, and helpful. Two thumbs up. "
7924,1170766,20162676,2014-09-24,21243906,Eduard,"Für uns war die Lage der Wohnung sehr günstig: nur 2 oder 3 Stationen mit T-Bana zum Zentrum, zu Fuß nach Gamla Stan 15 - 20 Minuten und Station Mariatorget nur 10 Minuten entfernt. In der Nähe von Mariatorget mehrere Restaurants / Konditoreien für den kleinen Hunger. Die Wohnung war sehr ruhig und für unsere Bedürfnisse gut ausgestattet. Aufstieg und Abstieg mit Gepäck über die Trepppe (kein Lift) wäre für uns ""golden agers"" schwierig gewesen, aber Annika ließ es sich nicht nehmen, die Koffer selbst zu tragen. Der freundliche Empfang und die Fürsorge während des Aufenthaltes waren vorbildlich."
7925,1170766,20451982,2014-09-29,21097944,Hanna,"My boyfriend and I spent three nights at Annikas Apartment. The location was perfect - there were plenty of shops and restaurants just a couple of minutes’ walk from the apartment. The area is very relaxed and has a cool vibe. You can easily reach Gamla Stan and City by foot, and the metro station is very close. The apartment was light and supplied with all necessary things. Annika was very welcoming and gave us many advices. She was also very flexible when it came to check in/check out.

We would really recommend this apartment, and we would be happy to stay here again :)
"
7926,1170766,20766166,2014-10-05,20648996,Kaveh,A perfect place to feel truly independent in Stockholm. I had a perfect stay.
7927,1170766,20962559,2014-10-08,8763003,Mark,Annika was a great host from the moment I booked the listing until the morning I left. The flat is very comfortable and clean. Location is close to the metro and grocery stores. 
7928,1170766,21292657,2014-10-14,15729969,Jan Rikus,"Het appartement is ruim, licht en schoon. Het ligt op de bovenste etage dus moet je wel wat trappen op om het te bereiken. De ligging is behoorlijk centraal in Stockholm zodat veel te voet kan worden bereikt. De metro is echter ook dichtbij. Een stalling voor huurfietsen is wat verder weg. De foto met netten voor werkzaamheden is niet actueel, er wordt niet gewerkt. Af en toe hoor je een vliegtuig, vooral in de ochtend.
"
7929,1170766,21894113,2014-10-26,2698787,Marion,"This apartment is my new favorite place to stay in Stockholm (and I already had another hostess I loved). The location is excellent, in a fun and lively neighborhood, 2 minutes from the subway and a good supermarket, not to mention bars, shops and a major theater. The space is easily 3x as large as I'd expected, full of windows and skylights - plus the porch, which bad weather sadly kept me away from. The kitchen is well equipped, the bed is very comfortable, and Annika is a kind and attentive hostess -- conveniently just downstairs if you need her! Only 2 small warnings: 1) this is an attic apartment in a 4-story walk-up building on a hilltop; and 2) if you need a dark room to sleep, consider bringing an eye mask -- there are shades, of course, but also skylights. Overall, an A-quality spot. Will be back."
7930,1170766,23078202,2014-11-22,23593927,Andrew,"Annika is an ideal host being both caring and attentive without being intrusive.  We always had the feeling that she had our welfare as a priority.
Location is good for public transport, everyday shops and walking across to Gamla Stan and beyond.  There are a collection of second-hand and charity shops in this district that are worth an explore; in one of these shops avoiding the clothes scrum I bought an oil painting for £28 that turn out to be worth maybe £500, on investigation back in England!
The flat at the top of the building does not have a lift but we warned about this beforehand -it can be a slog late at night, but the we found the flat inherently warm despite the cold weather at that time of year (mid-November).  It is quiet too and lots of windows and a balcony to look out of.
A good base as a tourist and also for business and the free WiFi was fast and problem free.  
Happy to recommend."
7931,1170766,23654722,2014-12-07,23620393,Daniel,"Annika was extremely helpful in helping locate the apartment. The apartment was clean and big with plenty of sheets and towels.

In addition, the apartment was on the top floor and offered great views. 

The apartment was located in a great neighborhood.  It was two blocks from a street with numerous restaurants and bars. I would definitely stay at Annika's again. "
7932,1170766,25557341,2015-01-19,25353217,Eric,"Annika made me feel right at home with a quick guided tour around the flat and stocking the fridge with some provisions. She checked that everything was okay too midway through the week that I stayed. 

The flat was bright with daylight even in the middle of January. Annika's photographs capture the flat very well. My experience was that the flat was spacious, well heated with plenty of hot water too. The decor is calm. The bed very comfortable - though I did manage to bump my head off a low corner over it, despite Annika's warnings.

The streets outside are relatively quiet though you can look down on the distant hustle and bustle. There are lots of restaurants, cafes, shops and bars nearby. So it's very well placed for exploring Sodermalm.

I will be recommending her flat to friends when they visit Stockholm."
7933,1170766,26397034,2015-02-11,2698787,Marion,"This was my second stay in Annika's studio, now my favorite place to stay in Stockholm (and I have several good spots in the city!). Not only is Annika a warm, friendly and caring hostess, but the place is huge, comfortable and very well appointed. I particularly like the kitchen, with everything you need to make your own meals, and of course the light everywhere, from the east- and west-facing windows and the skylights. Combined with a perfect location, it's really hard to resist, and worth every one of the stairs to get up to it!"
7934,1170766,29516729,2015-04-08,8216812,Cecilia,"I give this accommodation, and the host, the highest possible recommendation. The place is very nice, and as described on the site. It is an excellent location with all amenities nearby. Many restaurants and cool stores a 2 min walk from the door, and the subway is about 3 min away. The place is comfortable and warm, has a deck and many skylights. The host is a very nice lady and takes good care of her guests. Well worth the price asked!

I am sorry to leave! :)

Beliggenheten er sentral og leiligheten er også ren og lys. Annika er en god vertinne; fleksibel, hjelpsom og blid. Veldig hyggelig å ha med henne å gjøre. Dette stedet anbefaler jeg gjerne!"
7936,1170766,32536701,2015-05-19,6540503,Marie,"Great location in Stockholm. We loved it. It's near to the metro station so you can reach everything in no time. Plus, also very convenient, you have 2 supermarkets just next to the metro station. The apartment is spacious and very clean with everything you need. But as the description also says, it's a very bright apartment. Which is very nice at daytime, but if you have troubles sleeping in the light, bring a sleeping mask. In spring and summer the sun comes up véry early :). Annika is also very open and helpful if you would need information. We can definitely recommend this place."
7937,1170766,32873122,2015-05-22,4391812,Andrew,"Annika was fantastic and went out of her way to accommodate me during a short, last minute trip to Stockholm. The apartment get lots of natural light and is the perfect base to explore my favourite area in Stockholm - Södermalm. There are loads of nice bars and restaurants on the doorstop. I will definitely try to visit again.

7939,1170766,37172839,2015-07-05,28609729,Juliette,"Annika’s is the best place for the perfect journey in Stockholm

 We stayed in Annika’s appartment in Mariatorget for a week. The place is perfect. We enjoyed the space and brightness of it. Kitchen and bathroom are clean and really easy to use. We certainly enjoyed the balcony (breakfast under sunshine is always a delight) and the neighborhood. Lots of coffees, restaurants and shopping places. You can walk easily to the old city by the Monteliusvagen walk (a really peacefull walk and the best view upon the City). Even though the appartement is located in the city, the place is really calm. You can hear the seagulls sing every morning. Directly outside of the appartement you have supermarkets for food shopping and buses, the subway station to reach the center of the city in 10 minutes.

Really the best place to stay in Stockholm with a very welcoming guest… Annika’s place is the best !

Il y a des supérettes et le métro à deux minutes, ainsi qu'une station Rentabike qui n'est pas très loin. Tout ce qu'il faut pour passer un bon séjour à Stockholm, et Annika est charmante! Nous avons pu arriver vers 22h30 et repartir quand nous le souhaitions, ce qui a été très pratique. "

Comme il est indiqué, prévoir des masques de nuit pour les personnes qui n'arrivent pas à dormir avec la lumière du jour. Clarté très agréable. 

Very welcoming, our hostess met us at distance perfectly. The room is actually a studio that is most cozy. As noted, provide sleep masks for people who do not sleep with the light of day. We loved the brightness of the flat. "

From directions on how to get there till the handover of the keys, everything worked out perfectly. I can only recommend you staying there if you're looking for a nice spot in a great part of town.
All must see sights close by or can be reached via the subway, which is just a few mins away from the apt.

The flat was exactly as published and in excellent conditions. We had everything we needed.
The location is also quite close to the touristic center and just next to the event we where attending to. The location for us was 11/10 

So.. I Would totally recommend this flat, both for the flat itself and for the host, which sometimes in airbnb is even more important.

Annika est d'une grande gentillesse et d'une attention exceptionnelle. 
L'appartement est vaste, lumineux,confortable, impeccable, rien ne manque. 
Les descriptions d'Annika nous ont permis de trouver très facilement. 
Le studio est à proximité d'une station de métro et d' Un supermarché ouvert 7/7 jusqu'à 22h. 
Une station de vélib est également à proximité sur les quais. 
Si nous devons revenir à Stockholm, ça sera chez Annika"
7991,1170766,202189690,2017-10-10,152754125,Alwara,"De foto's die op airbnb staan doen het appartement geen recht. In het echt is het stukken knusser en gezelliger ingericht. In het appartement is alles aanwezig voor een prettig verblijf. Annika had een tweede bed voor ons  klaargezet, zodat we heerlijk konden slapen. 
De locatie is centraal en heel gemakkelijk met de metro te bereiken. Slechts 2 of 3 haltes van Gamla Stan af. 
Op loopafstand zitten meer dan genoeg leuke restaurantjes en supermarkten.
Echt een aanrader!!"

She even gave us umbrellas for a heavy rainy day.
We’ll stay again if we are in Stockholm. Thanks!"

Sodermalm has much to offer with Akkurat beer hall being close by. We stayed in November and the skylights weren't a problem. Maybe in summer they could be bright.
7996,1170766,226751919,2018-01-12,30490872,Gina,"We stayed four lovely nights in annika's cute apartment. It's very central, clean and a gorgeous space. The kitchen is a bit limited but it didn't matter for us. Perfect for a romantic getaway, Stockholm is a wonderful city. Annika was incredibly helpful and attended to our every need, I can't recommend her enough."

Het is een gezellige studio en voor mij echt een 'home away from home'. Ook ligt het appartement op de perfecte locatie om Stockholm te ontdekken. Annika is heel vriendelijk en gastvrij, ze reageerde snel op alle vragen die ik had en was altijd bereid om te helpen. Ik kan Annika's studio iedereen aanraden!"

Tatsächlich sollte man Schlafmasken dabei haben, wenn einen Helligkeit morgens stört. Die Wohnung ist lichtdurchflutet, was wir ansonsten toll fanden!"
8000,1170766,268583557,2018-05-25,12878286,Sally,Great location - super easy to hop on the train and get around the city from here. Annika was so helpful the whole way through and very accommodating. 
8001,1170766,270445452,2018-05-29,3023464,Deanna,"Annika is an amazingly host - she is so thoughtful, lovely and very responsive! The studio is in an amazing location - very close to public transportation and an easy walk to see the waterfront. Annika made the check-in process so easy and she was so sweet in reminding me to bring an eyemask since there are such long hours of sunlight during the summer in Stockholm. The bathroom is very spacious and there are shower curtains so that the entire bathroom doesn't get wet. She is also very close to my favorite bakery - Bageri Petrus! There are also multiple grocery stores nearby and her kitchen is fully stocked in case you want to make a meal at home. I loved my stay here in Stockholm and would highly recommend anyone to book this place :)"

The location is perfect for walking all over Stockholm (so relieved I did not bring a bike, as I kept stopping everywhere,  taking photos).  It's warm and cozy—like staying in your favorite aunt's attic.  The exercise, from walking up and down the stairs, was exactly what I needed.  And two fantastic benefits:  Paradiset (healthy grocery and deli) and Legumes Vegetarian Buffet (healthy and affordable restaurant) were just around the corner and across/down around the street.  Feeling much gratitude for this location and for Annika's kindness!"

It's in a hilly area with pretty views all around and a path overlooking the water. The bed was very comfortable! Nice work/eating table & a little terrace. The kitchen was more stocked and complete than expected. Perfect! "
8006,1170766,321732520,2018-09-11,12435479,Elizabeth,"Annika was home to greet us when we arrived and showed us to her penthouse apartment that is clean, spacious, and quaint. The room is like a studio apartment on a separate level using a separate entrance. The location is wonderful - close to bus and metro stations, has many good eateries nearby, and is about 25 minutes (at a strolling pace) to the old town Gamla Stan.

Overall, it was great to have a comfortable place like Annika's to come back to after trekking all over the city during our 3-day trip!"

The studio was bigger than we expected and even nicer than the pictures. It was very comfortable and had everything we needed. We cooked a few meals in the kitchen and there are several choices of supermarket right around the corner. Location is great, an easy walk across to Gamla Stan (or tunnelbana stop right nearby) that gets you anywhere you'd need. Sodermalm itself is very cool with lots of nice bars and restaurants too. Check in and out was easy and flexible and communication with Annika was great. A perfect Christmas in a lovely Airbnb. Thanks again Annika!"

Also metro station and supermarkets are  in a foot distance. The apartment looks really better then on photos. The kitchen is quite enough to prepare some basic food. The bed is very comfortable to sleep. Annika is a nice host, welcoming us and saying goodbye when we leaving."

I highly recommend her!"

The room was well prepared with towels, bedlinen, some fruits on the table and even some bread available! Annika was available on the phone is anything would have caused a problem what didn't happen.
Check-out also went well so all in all a perfect stay. By the way, getting into the city is just a short walk or taking the Tunnelbana. So kind of a perfect stay in Stockholm."

We are a family of four, who rented the apartment in the summer.
Christian and Karin were terrific hosts, we met a couple of times over (Hidden by Airbnb) prior to arriving, so we had the opportunity to see the apartment ahead of time and everything met our expectations.
The kitchen is well equipped and the upstairs renovations are gorgeous and makes it a perfect place for families to stay, with multiple bedrooms and bathrooms.
Location wise, this was ideal, with easy walking distance to t-bana, commuter train to airport and multiple restaurants and neighborhood shops nearby.
We had a wonderful stay, thank you!

Christian was a great host--very helpful with tips about the city, transportation etc. The location of the apartment was perfect;  well situated for access to public transportation, a few minutes walk to a grocery and many restaurants. We were there with our two young children and the Astrid Lindgren park was a short walk away. The apartment itself was lovely and newly renovated. It was very quiet, situated on the back side of an inner courtyard, had two great balconies, and the decor was modern and artistic. To our children's delight, Christian kindly invited them to play with any of the toys in the house. A great vacation week for us!"

8043,1173290,9668920,2014-01-05,873109,Scott,"My family and I stayed at Christian's flat over New Year's week, and we had a comfortable and enjoyable time. The flat is quite large, especially for downtown Stockholm, and the Vasastan area is packed with grocery stores, restaurants, bars, and shops. It's very convenient to various forms of public transportation, and I took many walks from there to multiple other areas of downtown. The area is surprisingly quiet, and the flat was quite clean. I'd enjoy staying there again. "
8044,1173290,14556344,2014-06-22,2172733,Suzanne,"We had a great time staying in Christian's apartment. He was a wonderful host--friendly and helpful up the four flights of stairs to his apartment.  It is a two level apartment with two full bathrooms, 4 bedrooms and two beautiful balconies. It was a perfect location for our conference at Karolinska Institute (about a 10 minute walk) and an easy walk (20 minutes) or subway ride into the center of Stockholm. The Arlanda airport bus stops at St. Eriksplan which is within walking distance to the apartment. We will gladly stay at his place when we visit Stockholm again."
8045,1173290,15254996,2014-07-06,13627645,Emma,"Lovely big flat with four separate bedrooms, a large kitchen and a cosy sitting room upstairs. We were in Stockholm for a 2-week summer school at the university. This flat was just what we needed - in a nice location, close to both the centre of town and the university (about 30 mins by tube). Making a booking for the washing facilities is a little complicated, but perfectly manageable if you're computer literate.

The hosts are very friendly and helpful. Christian was great at communicating in advance about the arrangements, and quick to reply to emails. I would thoroughly recommend this property. "
8046,1173290,15751547,2014-07-15,14179835,Susanne,"My family had a very nice stay in Christian's home one week in July. 2014. The apartment is very nice and well equipped and a perfect frame for a holiday; situated in a fantastic street in a very nice area of Stockholm, the street is full of small, very good restaurants not crowed too much of tourists. Also very close to a central Metroline and also close to the bus for the airport. Christian is a very nice host and more than willing to support and provide service e.g. Christian pointed out a very fine fitness center for us. I can only recommend this apartment if you want to stay on a private home in Stockholm in a authentic   area and close to everything you need; sights, transport and local atmosphere and possibilities for shopping and nice food."

His appartement is very nice and located in a very practical place.
It's close enough to the airport, easy to find by car and very close to the subway.
The neigbourhood is really quiet but you can find many bars and restaurants at a few meters in the street of the appartement. 
Christian has plenty of leaflets explaining different activities that you can do in Stockholm. It helped us more than the guide we had bought in France.
Christian and his wife were very nice and helped us a lot. They gave us all the informations and advices at the beginning of our trip and they did all they could to help us when we needed.
We were 4 friends and we stayed there for 10 days during the summer. We all really recommand this place.
Thanks a lot for that wonderfull time."
8049,1173290,22242219,2014-11-02,4501991,Claudio,"Christian is a great host and we (two colleagues and me) very much enjoyed staying at his cozy place while attending a conference at the Karolinska Institute.
He was very helpful and we highly recommend his place and would come back anytime without hesitation"
8050,1173290,24525786,2014-12-30,4221866,Claire,"Christian's apartment is truly beautiful, cosy, and well located.
We spend 6 days there, 5 adults, and we felt home instantly. Christian welcomed us very nicely, and he had left brochures about the city and instructions for the apartment. 
He was also very helpful and receptive to give us a hand to prepare our trip in stockholm.

The neighborhood is nice, calm, we found all we needed (supermarkets, wine sailer...) very close to the house, and you can be in the city center easily and fast with the subway.

We all really enjoyed our stay at Christian place, and we will recommended it for any family who'd like to go in Stockholm.  

Thank you Christian for this stay !!"
8051,1173290,27098612,2015-02-25,2500902,Giovanna,"L'accoglienza è stata ottima e calorosa. L'appartamento, molto accogliente,  ha superato le aspettative.Unico incoveniente, per gente un pò avanti negli anni come noi, la mancanza di ascensore. Il quartiere è fornito di negozi e ristoranti e molto comodo per i mezzi di trasporto.
Un'esperienza assolutamente da ripetere anche per il calore della famiglia Gandini!"
8052,1173290,27509210,2015-03-06,27987790,Joel,"Great apartment, great host. Very clean, all the information we needed was available and organized when we arrived. Christian met us when we got there, gave us a quick tour, and everything was easy to find and use. The apartment was very comfortable, spacious, bright cozy, and the two floors each have bedrooms and bathrooms, so it was easy to ""spread out"" and have our own space, even while staying in the same apartment. Christian has a very reasonable list of ""house rules"" and that should only demonstrate to you that he cares about you and the apartment more than most. The full kitchen had all the little things you might need, the bathrooms both have showers, there are two balconies, and it feels like a home, not a rental. We had absolutely no complaints. Highly recommended."
8053,1173290,27834464,2015-03-13,2797095,Justin,"The place was very clean and convenient and Christian was very committed to make the stay of our guests (whom we had booked the place for) as comfortable and convenient as possible. He communicated well in advance with all the details about the booking and once our guests had checked in, Christian followed up to make sure that they were comfortable.

A perfect host whom I would highly recommend!"
8054,1173290,29662585,2015-04-11,25547393,Matt,"Christian and Karen made us feel very welcome and we felt right at home. The apartment itself is beautiful and we certainly felt a sense of ""place"": it reflects the Swedish sense of style. We had everything we needed and it proved a great jumping off point for our exploration of the city. There is very easy access to the great Stockholm public transportation network, but it is also easy to walk into the city centre. There are plenty of restaurants in the neighbourhood as well. All in all we would heartily recommend this apartment to others."
8055,1173290,35650068,2015-06-21,30601458,Frances,We were made to feel so welcome and our host spent time with us after we arrived telling us about the local area and also about the best way to travel around stockholm. We felt very much at home in the appartment which is very spacious.  The appartment is in a great location with a train station and local buses just 5 minutes walk from the appartment.  If we were to go back to Stockholm again we would have no hesitation in staying there again.
8056,1173290,36264307,2015-06-27,28834446,Kim,"Christian gave us very thorough directions to the apartment and met us there with open arms into his home. The apartment was in very clean and tidy shape, and we were very excited to start our European adventure there! The four bedrooms suited the 6 of us very comfortably, especially having two bathrooms and two balconies! He is a really wonderful host who is accommodating, kind, and very willing to help you find what you need (grocery store, bank, shopping, etc.). I would HIGHLY recommend him and this apartment to anyone visiting Stockholm! Thank you, Christian!! :) "
8057,1173290,37278442,2015-07-06,22123105,Anne-Sophie,"Tak for ""lån"" af jeres hjem, det var en skøn base for vores ophold i Stockholm. At bo i en lejlighed er perfekt når man rejser med mindre børn, og der var legetøj osv. klar til dem hvilket var et stort hit!Christian var den perfekte vært, trods han har ikke var fysisk tilstede, var han meget opmærksom på vores ankomst og ophold via mail. Og det fungerede upåklageligt at hente og aflevere nøglen i 7eleven!
De bedst anbefalinger herfra.. hvis vi skal til Stockholm en anden gang, vil vi gerne bo her igen! "
8058,1173290,38369244,2015-07-15,4983057,Donald,"We visited Christian's top floor apartment with our three teenage boys.  It was spacious, clean and well equipped in two full floors. My wife and I shared a large master bedroom on the first floor where the kitchen and living room are located, while the three boys each had their own bedroom plus recreation area on the second floor.  
The apartment is centrally located close to the St. Eriksplan metro stop and a twenty minute walk from Central train station.  Shopping for food is easy as grocery stores are only a couple of minutes' walk away.  Many good restaurants are located on the same street close by.
We were very pleased with our choice of apartment and would gladly rent it again.  It was an ideal location for us to visit Stockholm, a very beautiful city, particularly in the summer. "
8059,1173290,39485711,2015-07-24,12422546,Musse,"Vi kan kun tale godt om lejligheden, som var ren og pæn og lækkert indrettet. Lejligheden lå skønt og levede fuldt ud op til vores forventninger. Kan kun anbefales."
8060,1173290,41920867,2015-08-10,28951864,Timothée,"Christian's appartment is better in reality than on picture! I spent 6 days with 3 others friends. Each one had his own real room and real bed, everything is clean, comfortable and warmful (special bonus for some furniture). The appartment is quiet (upon an inner courtyard with no noise, no cars). The balconies are perfect to have breakfeast on a sunny day in the morning. The neighborhoods are desserved by a direct train to central station and subway line, which is very comfortable to move around the city. The street of the building is pleinty of restaurants and alimentary shops and commodities.
I talked to christian by e-mail several months before arriving and he was available by mail for any question during our estancy. Have a nice journey in Stockholm! Tim"
8061,1182616,5154956,2013-06-15,1773239,Martin,"Peter is a really friendly guy and I had a great stay at his place in Stockholm. He's been very responsive (usually within some minutes) as i booked very short notice, everything was clean and organized. And the location of the room is just perfect! "
8062,1182616,5269927,2013-06-21,6068554,Bethany & Corey,"Peter's place was in the perfect location to explore Stockholm. 15min walk to central station, 2mins to metro station. Area is surrounded by heaps of parkland, restaurants and shopping. Room has a lovely little balcony that is great to have breakfast on in the morning.
Peter was a great host, more than willing to help with any requests.
Another couple were staying in the other room but they were excellent housemates, no concerns whatsoever. 
We would highly recommend Peter's apartment for anyone to stay. "
8063,1182616,5385451,2013-06-27,5966625,Daryl,"Peter's place was a great place to stay in while exploring Stockholm. Conveniently located near the metro station, it was easy to get about. The room was clean and spacious. Would definitely recommend this place."
8064,1182616,5467857,2013-07-01,740894,Vandana,"Peter is a wonderful Host and I really appreciate his prompt reply and 
helpful nature. I had a very peaceful stay at his apartment and I would 
strongly recommend his place."
8065,1182616,5622303,2013-07-08,6659370,Susannah,"My sister Lucy and I had a great few days staying at Peter's place. The apartment was clean, comfy and in a great location for seeing the lovely city of Stockholm. We were able to use the city bike scheme- picking up bikes from very close to the apartment each morning to head out and explore. Peter was a  very kind and friendly host. He was great at communicating prior to our arrival and was there to greet us when we arrived at the apartment on the middle of thee day. He also kindly let us leave our bags in the apartment until our evening flight home on our last day. Thanks for a great stay! We'd love to come back to Stockholm- beautiful city and such friendly people. "
8066,1182616,5650430,2013-07-09,387684,Nico,"Great place to stay and Peter was of good help, providing us with some maps and useful info about the neighborhood. Loved the balcony."
8067,1182616,5718461,2013-07-13,7082495,Isabella,"We enjoyed staying in Peter's flat. It's great located, clean and comfy. It was great to meat Peter, he was a great host. I highly reccomand this place! P. s. the bed is perfect! "
8068,1182616,5813112,2013-07-17,7061715,Daria,"We totally loved the place! First, it was a great location - just a couple stations from the Old City by direct line, a 2 minute walk from the metro station, a lot of shops around the place. We loved Mini Prix shop where we bought wonderful salads from salad bars (with shrimps, etc.) for dinner for a very good price when we didn't eat out. Second, the place was clean and VERY quiet - that was really important for us. Third, the host (Peter) was extremely friendly and nice! He couldn't meet us on the date we arrived so his absolutely lovely friends met us. Forth, the room itself was very good - big, light (we had a lovely balcony), with a big wardrobe with a lot of space for our things, the bed had two lamps on the sides - so each of us could read. Fifth, the also loved the kitchen - big and light, we always cooked our breakfast there. 

I would definitely recommend the place! 
"
8069,1182616,5868624,2013-07-20,3055504,Tina,"My friend and I had a very nice stay at Peters apartment. It is very close to the city centre and close to the river where you can go for a swim. Peter and Marcus were both very helpful and a nice host. 
I can definitely recommend a stay at their place!"
8070,1182616,5918456,2013-07-22,2041898,Claudia,Peter and Marcus are super friendly and their apartment is great. The room was nice and had a good balcony. There's a big kitchen as well and the bathroom is big. Stockholm is a lovely city and the apartment is conveniently located. We never used the public transport and enjoy walking around :-). I'd definitely go back!
8071,1182616,5989634,2013-07-25,7013949,Miriam,"Peter's apartment is really nice. The big room is beautiful and tidy. The best part is the balcony, where we could enjoy breakfast in the morning sun. The kitchen is also large and nice, we used it several times. I would recommend this place!"
8072,1182616,6085765,2013-07-29,7114648,Brian,"Peter was a great host - even though he was not able to be in the apartment. While he was away teaching dance lessons in Berlin, my girlfriend and I had a great stay in one of his rooms. There was plenty of space for our stuff, a great balcony on which to eat, and all the cooking instruments needed. The Wifi password was a bit long (but secure!) but that's the only negative. The location of the place was great (near metro and major supermarkets + an easy walk to a park where you can walk into the water). "
8073,1182616,6155465,2013-08-01,6142800,Julie,Well locate apartment and really nice balcony ! Good stay at Peter's!
8074,1182616,6312481,2013-08-07,7477446,Anna Rita E Luca,peter is a very helpful and flexible person. I was really fine during the period in his house. the room was big and vey clean. I hope to return.
8075,1182616,6466717,2013-08-13,4786681,Maiken Harder,"A nice place to stay in Stockholm with a fine location in a cozy neighbourhood. 
Peter and his friend are good hosts, flexible and easy to get in touch with."
8076,1182616,6519004,2013-08-15,1856394,Joep & Judith,Peters place is spacious and very nice. With the metro station just around the corner we could go where ever we wanted in Stockholm. Peter is very friendly and easy going. We would recommend this place to everyone.
8077,1182616,6576899,2013-08-17,8086259,Stefano,"Peter is a great host attentive and very communicative , which really puts the guest at ease. The apartment is comfortable, with a small terrace, in summer is a great added value. The subway is very close , very easy to visit the city, starting from the house of Peter. Great experience."
8078,1182616,6853632,2013-08-27,7597253,Jose Manuel,"Peter en una persona muy agradable, la casaa estaba bien, la situación de la misma te permite ir andado al centro de la ciudad, "
8079,1182616,6916437,2013-08-30,7628133,Quirze,"We had a really nice stay at Peter's apartment. It's a clean and confortable place and also well located, close to the old city (Gamla Stan) and 1min from the metro.
Peter is an attentive and flexible guy, he made everything easy for us."
8080,1182616,6989053,2013-09-02,243845,Man-Yan,"Peter is an Airbnb host pro! Although he wasn't in town the weekend that we arrived in Stockholm, he did more than enough to ensure that we had a perfectly smooth check-in with very clear instructions via multiple channels of communication. The room was a decent size for two friends, and the balcony was very charming. The apartment was a hop away from the metro station, which was another added benefit, with a couple bars and plenty of convenience stores around. 

Although we didn't make use of the kitchen, it seemed like it was clean and accessible, too. "
8081,1182616,7894306,2013-10-07,8981811,Martin,"Peter is very kind and his place is functional : quiet, a few minutes walk for the center, storage furniture, ... And Peter is discreet and flexible."
8082,1182616,8013495,2013-10-12,1395356,Gary,"We didn't see Peter much as he was busy and we were busy but from our short encounters he was nice, polite and welcoming. Clearly he takes this seriously and is quite professional with his guests.

The place is close to a selection of supermarkets and the train station is a short walk away taking you to the city center in no time. Our room was big and clean as was the bathroom and kitchen. I would definitely stay there again and that is as good a recommendation as anyone can give."
8083,1182616,8026559,2013-10-13,8184948,Azadeh,My husband and I stayed at Peter's place for one night. It was a great location with few min walk to the Metro station and about 20 min walk to central station. Room was very clean with good space for two persons and a balcony. Peter was friendly and very flexible with check-in/out. 
8084,1182616,8096927,2013-10-15,7522687,Jennifer,"Peter was very professional, and the room was large and comfortable. He wasn't there when we arrived, but his friend Marcus (who speaks far better English than he gives himself credit for!) was there to help us out and show us the ropes. The room we stayed in has a great enclosed balcony that I loved hanging out on. There are multiple rooms sharing one toilet and bath (I think 3, but it might only be 2), which could get dicey, but we only had to wait once to use it. Though the apartment is not in the middle of most touristy things, it’s within walking distance from Central Station if you don’t mind a bit of a walk and, if you do, there’s a T-bane stop within a couple blocks. The neighborhood is quiet and has several options for reasonably priced food, which is nice in an expensive city!

My favorite parts about staying with Peter…
* Great value
* Peter is very professional with great communication
* Large, comfortable room with a nice balcony

Perfect place for…
* Travelers looking for a great value in Stockholm."
8085,1182616,8141938,2013-10-17,2616153,Chandra Kiran,"Peter's apartment is very conveniently located and easy to locate. It is quite  close to t centralen and hence easy to get to from anywhere. We had a private room with a balcony. The room is exactly as described with a shared bathroom that is fairly large and well maintained. Peter is a easily accessible host and ensures that his guests do not have any trouble reaching the apartment or at the apartment itself. Although we stayed here only for one night, we would certainly recommend Peter's apartment to other guests."
8086,1182616,8223938,2013-10-21,9052221,Sven,"Really nice apartment, close to the city center and a subway (tunnel bana!) just around the corner.
Peter is a very nice and welcoming host! Definately recommended."
8087,1182616,8323323,2013-10-25,3253291,Viktor,Peter var en bra värd och allt gick smidigt. Läget var super!
8088,1182616,8381343,2013-10-28,9267856,Kirsten,"We had a very nice stay at Peter's. The room was just as described, the appartment just a good walk away from the city center in a good neighborhood and only 3 min from the next subway station. Since Peter couldn't be there to greet us himself, he made sure we'd get the key so that we could unpack. Would recommend his room to anyone."
8089,1182616,8480995,2013-11-02,8731064,Sam,"Great location, room and kitchen, and a very welcoming host."
8090,1182616,8642913,2013-11-10,4383660,Daniel,"We liked Peter's place, it is exactly as described .. spacious room and we loved the location.  Very close to a metro station and supermarkets.  We met Peter once and he was very friendly, kind and from the beginning very easy to comunicate with for arrengements. "
8091,1182616,8729524,2013-11-14,9300534,Maaike,"We stayed 4 nights at Peter's place. It was a clean room, which looked great and the shower was excellent! The apartment is nearby the metro which was very convenient. Thank you Peter!"
8092,1182616,8789809,2013-11-18,9534408,Daniel,"Staying at Peter's house was great! Situated a very short walk from a metro station and close to various grocery, fast food and coffee shops, the location really was ideal. The house was clean and peter was really friendly. The room was easily large enough for two, and the balcony only adds to the space. I can thoroughly recommend the entire experience and Peter's apartment as a comfortable, clean and friendly place to stay! "
8093,1182616,8924406,2013-11-25,1805513,Airiin,"Staying at Peter's was great! The apartment was very nice, spacious and really conveniently located. Peter was a very friendly and helpful host. "
8094,1182616,8956281,2013-11-28,2698787,Marion,"The apartment is in a very good location, a block from the Fridhemsplan T-bana stop, with easy access to shops, restaurants, etc. The room itself is large, with a very nice porch with a view of the sunrise, and the bed is comfortable. The kitchen is more modestly equipped than I've found in other places, and nothing was provided (not even tea), but that's more about lack of clarity than a fault. It's also important to note that this is one of two rooms that are rented out, and the other, which can accommodate more people, happened to be occupied by a rather messy group when I arrived, so the kitchen was a mess and the flat smelled like a college dorm. The next day everything was tidied up. I never did meet Peter, but he was very pleasant and prompt in his replies via email. So... a mixed experience, but generally good."
8095,1182616,9120519,2013-12-08,10133996,Edy,"Great host, responsible and helpful. Clean place.  Very recommended."
8096,1182616,9153935,2013-12-09,10133996,Edy,"This was my first time really travelling on my own and took a friend's advice to use airbnb and save some money. I had an amazing experience for my first time using airbnb.

It was even better than a hotel. I got the feeling of actually living in Sweden, got to talk to a person from Sweden and had a very pleasant overall stay in an awesome area right in the city.

The place was clean and very Swedish! Peter the host was kind, understanding, considerate and very responsive.

I sure hope the next hosts are as good. If Peter remains the same then you'll have a great time!

One thing to note is that you will be sharing the place with others (three rooms total) but that wasn't an issue for me as my room was private and most of the time I was alone.

Highly recommended for your visit to amazing Sweden."
8097,1182616,9194225,2013-12-12,4716250,Jenny / Nico,"Being Airbnb host ourselves, we usually look for places to stay for a similar budget price as we ask. In Stockholm centre you will quickly end up at Peter's place. Though breakfast is not included, some basic things made available for general use like sugar, margarine, marmalade etc. for travellers staying for one or two days only, would be convenient. We also did miss a coffee machine, a complementary map of Stockholm, some brochures of tourist spots and some hints to use the public transport system.
The location is good, but walking to all top attractions requires well trained legs. 
Though we haven't seen Peter hardly, he seemed to us a most friendly guy. Travellers who appreciate privacy, should realize that the facilities must be shared with occupants of the two other Airbnb rooms, but if you wish to visit Stockholm and have a bed for an affordable price, sure Peter's place is recommendable.
"
8098,1182616,9362837,2013-12-24,4600796,Berit,"Peter's place is just perfect to explore Stockholm!
We spent a couple of days and even though we never met Peter in person I can say that he is a really great host. The appartment is very clean and well equipped. We even got a little christmas present! :)
I would definately recommend it!"
8099,1182616,9435236,2013-12-28,2711891,Sarah Beckham,"Peter was out of town, but he has a great way of transferring keys to arriving guests. There was another set of guests in the flat, but it is definitely big enough to be no problem. We never ended up meeting Peter, but he is a nice host, and even left some chocolate for us! 
The only problem that I could see is that we couldn't figure out how to lock our door when we went out (but maybe we just didn't get something), so un-trusting guests might prefer to take there valuables with them... "
8100,1182616,9513710,2013-12-31,10363855,Valeria,"A really cosy accomodation, in a really nice and confortable flat. It has been really nice staying at Peter's: he's really good at organizing the hosting in a really smart way!"
8101,1182616,9545368,2014-01-02,9815863,Chiara,Peter is a very good host! He is very kind band the appartment is really pretty and near The centre!
8102,1182616,9628960,2014-01-03,5903407,Celeste,Peter was very good in all correspondence and in arranging key pick up. Room was large. Shared apartment with others during our stay but everyone kept to themselves. 
8103,1182616,9816165,2014-01-12,3264746,Willy,Peter was extremely nice and helpful. I lost an item on the plane and helped me call various places to help me find it. The place is excellent and the location is very close to Fridhemsplan metro station. Often Peter is not at the apartment so you usually have the place to yourself and the other roommates. 
8104,1182616,9931031,2014-01-20,10141331,Matt,"Peters house was very clean, warm, inviting and central to Stockholm!! Peters communication was awesome!! Sadly we didn't get to meet Peter as all 3 rooms were booked so he was not staying there. Be prepared to wait for the bathroom is all 3 rooms are booked. Especially when there are girls there haha"
8105,1182616,10006623,2014-01-25,10527632,Sidonie,"We stayed in Peter's flat for 4days and it was our first experience with airbnb. Thats was great: you really feel like home and you can ask everything about the country.. Peter was a really good host even if we didn't meet him a lot. The place isn't far from the heart of stckhlm and the walk by the water to go there is really fabulous!
"
8106,1182616,10055853,2014-01-27,9761078,Yan,"Peter is a perfect host. He responded to my several inquiries instantaneously. Location of his place is very easy to find (thanks to his clear instructions) when I arrived by public transportation. He welcomed me in person, and answered my questions about the city. Checkout process was also very smooth. If I go to Stockholm again, I will definitely go back to Peter's place. "
8107,1182616,10089646,2014-01-30,8630943,Freek,It was a pleasure staying at Peter's place.  The room is comfortable and clean.  The address is located in a very nice neighborhood and very accessible.  Great place to stay.

We have'nd had problems, there is no way to lockthe room'doors.

8111,1182616,10690973,2014-03-03,6805576,Maria,"Lejligheden var rigtig fin og nem at finde! Endelig var dens placering i byen god - temmelig central, så man kunne sagtens gå rundt :-) 
Vi hilste kort på Peter, han virkede rigtig rar. Det var specielt at der også var andre airbnb'ere i lejligheden, men de var alle rigtig søde, så det var en god oplevelse. 
Desuden var Peter virkelig hurtig til at svare på ens beskeder! :-)"
8112,1182616,10750705,2014-03-05,6493950,Eric,"Great, simple space with everything you need. A couple rooms available with other guests the entire time. Arrival and departure was smooth and easy. "
8113,1182616,10841762,2014-03-10,10120546,Lisa,"The apartment of Peter was perfect for a citytrip, close to the metro, busses and practical shops. The apartment was clean and practical. Peter was realy nice and reacted quick to questions. "
8114,1182616,11014083,2014-03-17,12141149,Cosimo,"Host veramente disponibile e gentile
Peter is a very helpful and polite, very happy to answer any question. The house is located in an area full of shops and shopping centers and close to downtown. 
See you next time in Stockholm."
8115,1182616,11309992,2014-03-29,13260565,Olof,"Lite besvike.. lät bättre än det var..
lägenheten hyste flera uthyrda rum till olika personer
ena kvällen hade det andra gästerna party.. inte så roligt

står rökfritt i presentationen..  rummet stank dock rök när jag kom
badrummet var ordentligt smutsigt..

8116,1182616,11342818,2014-03-31,10464039,Manon,"L'appartement était très sympa, avec une cuisine pratique et un joli balcon. Le cadre idéal pour une petite visite de cette magnifique ville! Peut être un petit peu loin du centre, mais très abordable au niveau du prix. Je vous le conseil! :)"
8117,1182616,11470157,2014-04-04,8271535,Nicolas,"We had a great stay at Peter's appartment, the bed was really conformtable and kitchen had everything needed to cook. Peter was really welcoming and answers all our questions. The location is great and close to the Central station (2 stops). I would 100% recommend this appartment !"
8118,1182616,11744769,2014-04-14,12453030,Kevin,"The stay at Peter's place in Stockholm was nice. The bedroom was clean and access to the kitchen really helped us budget. It is close to the metro and is only a 20min walk to the city centre. 
My only complains were that Peter was not around during our stay which concerned me about security since there were no locks on the bedroom doors. We were not aware of other guests in the apartment until about 12 hours before our arrival. Other than that, everything was great!"
8119,1182616,11848331,2014-04-16,3474126,James,"Nice room and balcony. Quick with responding. A little misleading in description as there were three other rooms of travelers, so it was more of a hostel than an apartment. One bathroom for 6 people was rough, and it required a lot of cleaning as the shower did not have a separate area in the bathroom (also it's not pictured). Priced adequately, just get the full story. "
8120,1182616,11950774,2014-04-20,2412589,Lena,"We had 3 great nights at Peters apparment. The room was as expected and shown on the photos, Peter is reliable and very helpful, so I can recommend this place if you want to spend some  cosy days in Stockholm City. We were mainly walking everywhere, but the metro is also close so getting arround smoothly will not be a problem at all. 

We really had a great time and enjoyed our stay at this apparment. Thank you Peter for being such a great host!! :)"
8121,1182616,12286209,2014-04-28,13276804,Serena,Great location and room and a very welcoming host!
8122,1182616,12393902,2014-05-01,11690177,Mina,"We enjoyed Peter's place. It was well equipped and  very well positioned. We never met Peter but we felt very welcome and he was very responsive via SMS. Although there we other people in the apartment, we never felt uncomfortable and there weren't any problems. It was nice to meet some of the people and hear about their experiences on their travels."
8123,1182616,12765874,2014-05-10,8717795,Ravi,"The set up and logistics getting keys and checking out was great and the apartment/room is in a great location in Stockholm, close to all public transport and the airport bus. It is a 3 bedroom apartment but note the doors to individual rooms do not have locks on them so you would not have a separate key to the room. Never met Peter but he responds to emails very quickly so there were no problems at all. "
8124,1182616,13071294,2014-05-19,13000917,Ann-Cathrine,Vistelsen har fungerat klanderfritt. Allt som vi behövt har funnits tillgängligt. Balkongen var ett gott val då vädret bjöd på solsken en av de två dagarna vi hyrde. Nära till fina mysiga matställen och tunnelbana för vidare transport. Ett rätt enkelt men bra boende. Peter är en uppmärksam och pålitlig värd enligt vår uppfattning.
8125,1182616,13535924,2014-05-30,12061400,Nancy,"We enjoyed staying at Peter's place in Stockholm.  It is very central and convenient to travel by Metro or bus around the city. It is in close walking distance of the lakefront. This is a shared living space although we only had another person in the space for one of three nights we were there. 

Peter was not able to meet us when we arrived and thus we missed having an orientation to the place and the community that would have been helpful.  "
8126,1182616,13649409,2014-06-02,10529273,Thomas,"Værten var ude at rejse, mens vi var i Stockholm, men han var hjælpsom via mail.
Jeg var skuffet over, at vi var 3 Airbnb-familier i samme lejlighed (i 3 værelser med 2 personer i hvert) - til eet badeværelse. Jeg havde forventet, at vi ville være de eneste gæster.
Kvarteret er behageligt og roligt. Der er et stykke at gå til centrum, men vi lejede cykler og så fungerer det helt fint.
"
8127,1182616,14208137,2014-06-14,6073628,Fred,One friend and myself stayed here for around 5 days and had a lovely time! The flat was clean and comfortable and Peter was super helpful and accommodating. We actually arrived far earlier in the day than we had planned but were able to drop our bags in the flat and recover in the kitchen from our overnight coach!
8128,1182616,14235997,2014-06-15,15466195,Ruth,"Our host was very friendly, thoughtful, and well organized.  The bed is super comfortable, and it was a  pleasure to sit on the balcony.  "
8129,1182616,14389510,2014-06-18,4526239,Katy,We had a good stay in Stockholm. The room was spacious and deck was nice. The location is convenient for exploring the city and close to metro and bus links. The apartment is in need of a clean and felt a little like a hostel with people coming and going all the time. Peter was very friendly and a welcoming host.
8130,1182616,14826007,2014-06-27,11077682,Hilary,"I really enjoyed my stay at Peter's apartment. The room was lovely, the location was extremely convenient (2 blocks from the T-bana!) and Peter was very friendly! I'll be keeping Peter's place on my list for recommendations when staying in Stockholm -- it was a great find!"
8131,1182616,14980083,2014-06-30,16193066,Sergey,"It was great staying at Peter’s apartment. Clean bathroom, fully equipped kitchen with huge fridges, bedroom with balcony and large comfy double bed (perhaps too soft for Spartan as I am). Well-located - close to the city center (about 20 minutes by walk). We really enjoyed our stay here. Would definitely highly recommend Peter’s place. Unfortunately we didn't met Peter, hope we can meet next time."
8132,1182616,15431997,2014-07-08,17302709,Ivan,Great place to stay. Handy location and lots of useful information from the host. 
8133,1182616,15514671,2014-07-10,9824328,Elise,"We did not meet Peter personally, but he provided us with excellent, detailed directions to his place. His apartment was clean, roomy and the beds were VERY comfy. "
8134,1182616,16191271,2014-07-22,18368980,Jordan,Had a great time at Peter's place. I didn't get the chance to meet Peter but the apartment is very close to the metro station and is very easy to get around the city.
8135,1182616,16567859,2014-07-29,5077097,Nadine,"Peter`s flat is cozy, very clean and fully equipped. We always had a good sleep and enjoyed our stay. Bike rent, Buses, T-bana and grocery are right in front of the door. A nice park is located in the back. Recommendable pretty place."
8136,1182616,16757083,2014-08-01,19091007,Yvonne,"Our host reacted extremely fast on our request if we could use his AIRBNB overnight. We felt more than welcome.
The apartment is simple but the kitchen is well equipped. good beds! We had a nice balcony. 
situated very comfortable near the centre of Stockholm City. The tube is a 3 minute walk away and in 3/4 of an hour your on the city centre square.
Our host and his friends made us more than clear that we were welcome."
8137,1182616,17083315,2014-08-06,3013692,Peter,"The apartment was perfect for our brief stay in Stockholm. Peter communicated swiftly about how to get to the apartment and where to find the key. The place was clean, and the kitchen was thoughtfully stocked with city maps, transit maps, maps of gay nightlife and museums. The room was comfortable, and the nice balcony shown in the ad was a relief in surprisingly hot weather. The apartment is a block away from a pick-up/drop-off point in new, inexpensive shuttle bus service to the airport, and in an easily reached part of town."
8138,1182616,17573592,2014-08-14,18011587,Denis,"Very nice experience. Peter is very responsive and he makes sure his guests are properly welcomed. Even though he did not live with us during our stay,  we had everything we needed.

Our room and the apartment were clean and comfortable. We really much appreciated the balcony. Metro station is only a few minutes walk event though we walked downtown (Gamla Stan) most often. 

The only minor issue is that at one point all three rooms in the apartment had guests which made eight of us to share the shower and bathroom. 

Nevertheless, we recommend Peter's apartment for your next stay in Stockholm.

"
8139,1182616,17710994,2014-08-16,19308558,Tim,This was our first trip to beautiful Stockholm and Peter greeted us at his BnB with friendly hospitality.  Peter's BnB is everything as advertised and in a great location within walking distance of many great places to visit in Stockholm. Parking is convenient. It's a popular BnB and other BnB guests may also be occupying the BnB during your stay. I would recommend this BnB to anyone visiting Stockholm. 
8140,1182616,17771967,2014-08-17,1562858,Hendrik,"The apartment is located on a good location. Contact with Peter  went pretty smooth. Although we agreed that my friend and I had to make up our own beds upon arrival (because Peter could not be at the apartment, something Peter let us know the day before arrival) we noticed that the room was just exactly as the previous guests had left it: with their used linnen stil on the bed, towels and so on. After we contacted Peter about this, he sent a friend to clean the room and from then on, everything was okay."
8141,1182616,18020349,2014-08-20,16855716,Loo Pin,"We saw Peter once or twice only but he is a friendly person. His place is clean and the room was big but affordable. It is also very close to the fridhemsplan train station as well as many supermarkets and food places.

There were other guests staying at the same time as us but they were really friendly travellers. But the only con was that we had to queue to use the sole toilet sometimes which can get rather inconvenient.

Other than that, the place is great and highly recommended!"
8142,1182616,18699508,2014-08-30,20044037,Karl,"Peter was always very quick to respond and always most helpful
I enjoyed my short stay -an overnight stop. The apartment is central and clean and spacious."
8143,1182616,18829110,2014-09-01,19829307,Thomas,Peter left very full instructions for our arrival and the flat was in good condition. The room was as expected and nicely clean too.
8144,1182616,19568438,2014-09-14,14962835,Yan Lin (Lynn),"We did not manage to meet Peter but he gave clear instructions on how to check in. The apartment's location was very good, a few minutes walk away from the metro station. We enjoyed our stay here."
8145,1182616,19706147,2014-09-16,2531590,Istvan,"It was easy to arrange the details with our host. He was very responsive and I felt all the time, that I am important for him. The apartment was perfect, located near to the city center. The public transport was excellent, everything was correct as that was described in the ads."
8146,1182616,19763813,2014-09-17,2635973,Alex,"In an elegant and raised apartment; the host provided us with towels. 

"
8147,1182616,20221135,2014-09-25,6771507,Marcus,I didn't meet Peter but was very helpful in giving instructions how to get there. It wasn't clearly mentioned in the listing that there were also (possibly) other guests staying there; however Peter did inform about that and it didn't bother me at all. There was some queuing to the bathroom/shower though. Overall had a nice quick stay!
8148,1182616,20899276,2014-10-07,19375629,Johannes Christian,"Peter was a very good host providing detailed information how to get to and in his flat. The room was very spatious and had a very nice balcony. Everything corresponds to the description. What we liked very much: kitchen, room and loaction of the flat. Flat is in a very nice quarter with many shops and supermarkets and restaurants nearby. Peter also give us the chance to wash our clothes in the very modern washroom of the building and we had the chance to exhange some views about Sweden..."
8149,1182616,21344636,2014-10-15,20795795,Jantine,"Thanks to Peter my stay in Stockholm has been very comfortable. Everything was organized perfectly, and Peter was very flexible in terms of checking-in times. 

The apartment was clean and cosy, and my room spacious. The neighborhood (Kungsholmen) is safe and bus stops / T-bana are around the corner.

Overall a great stay!"
8150,1182616,21555836,2014-10-19,22371903,Eric,"Staying at Peter's was great! We only saw Peter once but he was kind and friendly. He was also very good with communicating quickly and helping with any questions. We arrived earlier than expected and he was able to get our room together earlier than arrival by the time we were there.

His place was clean and comfortable. It was a nice place to come back and relax. We did not explore the area around his place but we felt safe around it and it was nice. The location is not the closest to the sights and main attractions. However, it was close to the metro which we used whenever going to and from his place which was very easy. It took about 20-30 minutes to get to most of the main attractions.

I would stay at Peter's again."
8151,1182616,21616531,2014-10-20,21074527,ShiJia,"Was at Peter's place for just one night. Didn't manage to meet him but he left detail instruction to enter the place and we had little problem getting in and cozy. the place could use a little cleaning up, but overall it's good. thanks Peter!"
8152,1182616,22358877,2014-11-04,986446,Joseph,"Peter arrived at the apartment at about the same time as we did and gave us a warm welcome.  The room wasn't quite ready for us when we arrived, but Peter made sure everything was cleaned and reset for us, as well as provided fresh towels and allowed us to use his laundry detergent.

While the floors could use a bit of a sweep since there's so many people in and out, the listing was very accurate and the neighborhood was wonderful!  Some of the other Airbnber's could be a little noisy late at night and the walls are a bit thin.  We didn't run into any major issues with the single bathroom either.

We only saw him once during our stay, but he had some great recommendations for us, along with a referral to the best vegetarian restaurant I've ever been to!  I would definitely stay at this apartment again."
8153,1182616,22450244,2014-11-06,23327247,Christian,"Great location, very reliable and helpful, good value for money. Highly recommended!"

8158,1182616,24211889,2014-12-22,21374023,Niki,One of the best living experience in Europe. It is so convenient to go to Peter's house from Airport. And it is only 3 minutes walk to the metro station and easy to find restaurants and markets nearby. Also the house is tidy and warm which makes us like home. Very good.
8159,1182616,24389330,2014-12-27,24853875,Leana,"Although we didn't meet Peter in person, the communication with him was very fast and uncomplicated. The room was just as described, spacious and with a nice balcony. And the kitchen was very nice and cozy. The location is very convenient, only 2 metro stops away from the centrum.  We had a nice stay, and I would recommend Peter's appartment. "
8160,1182616,24585105,2014-12-31,4407344,Wei Chin,"The two of us really enjoyed Peter's apartment. The space was adequate and comfortable. We made good use of the kitchen cooking and even baking. Peter is responsive, fast and friendly. Very helpful. The location is super."
8161,1182616,25046475,2015-01-05,21468076,Veronica,The location is great and the room is well prepared. Even though peter didn't meet us  in person but he gave excellent advice to visit the city. It was a nice stay.
8162,1182616,25526066,2015-01-18,26009206,Ruben,We had a very nice stay at Peter's place. The communication went very smoothly and everything was alright! 
8163,1182616,25610727,2015-01-20,12723773,Michael & Clare,"Peter was able to provide us with promt and plenty of information before going to Stockholm.
Unfortunately we missed our flight due to circumstances out of our hands and were not refunded any of the cost at all for the 2nights we'd planned to stay which was very disappointing on top of the missed flight. I contacted Peter as soon as we'd missed the flight as well.... Because of this we will be staying else where when we return."
8164,1182616,25649948,2015-01-21,25979726,Jc,"Peter is a great host. He has a busy life, but very welcome host and he take the time to talk with us and share some information. Dont hesitate to book him for hosting"

Très bien"

8168,1182616,26316598,2015-02-09,21961293,Renata,"Me senti realmente comoda en el piso y en la habitacion. El piso esta muy bien, con una cocina muy comoda donde cocinar y poder comer, y la habitacion estaba muy limpia, asi como el resto de la casa. 
La ubicacion es perfecta, en una zona tranquila pero rodeada de comercios y lugares donde comprar algo de comida y tomar algo, y es ideal para llegar desde Arlanda con autobus. El metro esta muy cerca pero es una buena zona para pasear hasta el Town Hall por el Norr Mälastrand.
Peter es un gran anfitrion, vino a saludarnos y por si necesitabamos alguna cosa. Y habia mapas y guias en la cocina para que el primer dia pudieramos hacernos una idea de la zona y la ciudad.
Realmente una perfecta opcion para alojarse en la ciudad, que por seguro, repetiria en una futura visita."
8169,1182616,26635948,2015-02-16,27123670,Abraham,"Peter's apartment was very nice and cozy; well located and easy to get there from the airport. He was a really nice host, attentive to our needs. Great experience!"
8170,1182616,27514843,2015-03-06,27568743,Tyler,"Clean apartment. Plenty of great food around. 15-20 walk to train station. 30 minute walk to old town. But Stockholm has great transportation, if you don't like walking get the ""Stockholm pass"" or whatever it is for transportation and entry to most museums. Room is good for two people. Peter is almost never home, I didn't meet him in 3 days, so it's almost like having a private home, unless there is someone in the other room. "
8171,1182616,27604996,2015-03-08,9561281,Brinda,Peter is a great host and it was easy to check in/out.  The space is big enough for two people and the outside patio is also very nice to have.  The location is really good because it's super close to the train and bus stops and there are tons of shops and stores nearby.
8172,1182616,27695118,2015-03-09,28573922,Niaombh,"My friend and I had a lovely stay at peters cosy little apartment, it is close to the city and very accessible to busses/trains etc. Peter was great with giving us directions to and from the airport. We only saw him briefly but he was very lovely. We really enjoyed our stay."
8173,1182616,27813772,2015-03-12,28628397,Karina,"Pretty nice location. 
Really easy going stay in a nice bright room!"

8175,1182616,28955850,2015-04-01,18438183,Maren,Nice location and nice room. The flat has thin walls though and it can get quite noisy with other guests staying in the apartment. We didn't meet Peter at all during our stay. We would have appreciated him checking the bathroom before we arrived. Otherwise in written contact he was nice and helpful.
8176,1182616,29452244,2015-04-07,6991397,Shira,"I didn't see Peter once throughout our 3 day stay. He didn't leave any personalized recommendations about what to do or see in Stockholm. The patio smelled like smoke the entire time we stayed there. The door was really hard to use (to the point where we weren't sure if we would be able to get in at night) and there weren't special instructions. You were expected to squeegee the floor yourself after you showered. Overall, I wasn't super impressed and could have stayed in a hotel that included breakfast for the price we paid for the room."
8177,1182616,29898532,2015-04-13,30963641,Diana,We had a great time staying at Peter's. Room was clean and it was really cool to have own balcony. 
8178,1182616,30423579,2015-04-21,31102798,Shawn,"Peter maintained constant contact with me via the Airbnb app to ensure that everything went smoothly. Unfortunately, our schedules conflicted and we never actually met one another.

Regardless, his place was pretty well kept. There were two other rooms, both occupied by other tourists (all of which were really friendly!)

The room itself was extremely spacious and very comfortable. The location was very close to a major transit station, so it was very easy to get around.

Thanks for having us!"
8179,1182616,30747091,2015-04-26,30249985,Ryan And Ellen,"We really enjoyed this place, never actually met Peter, but he responded quickly to all of our questions and was very helpful when we needed anything. "

El apartamento es muy limpio, ordenado, tiene todo lo necesario. Es muy central y tranquilo. "
8181,1182616,33292605,2015-05-26,10388944,Stas,"The place is very nice. You live (and share bathroom) with other people but it was not a problem. Metro station is nearby and the bus from Arlanda airport has a stop really close. 
Peter is very good communicating on Airbnb and gives you very precise instructions."
8182,1182616,33626971,2015-05-30,34107286,Camilla,"Abbiamo prenotato una stanza per tre e il terzo letto era un materasso per terra, rendendo anche difficile i movimenti nella stanza. La camera era poco pulita, un sacco di polvere sulle mensole; sporchi anche bagno e cucina. Infine nell'appartamento ci sono tre stanze da tre persone ognuna, ma un solo bagno. Non lo consigliamo."
8183,1182616,34599999,2015-06-09,3068310,Jonas,"I was in another city in Sweden and decided to travel to Stockholm the next day, so I needed a place quickly and I booked Peter's room. The room was perfect - big, clean, and with the balcony. The apartment was nice and I made fast friends with the other B&B guests. Peter was pleasant and accommodating. The neighborhood was perfect and close to the attractions. And the Champion's League final was playing in the bar downstairs and my favorite player scored the decisive goal. So yes, I had an amazing stay. My only regret is that my wife wasn't there to share it with me. Thank you Peter!

8185,1182616,34748216,2015-06-11,12786685,Max,"The listing was exactly as is and we enjoyed our stay in Stockholm. We met Peter once and he was super nice and very courteous. The room was a nice size and the bathroom was right next to the room. The patio was also one of the best parts because it was relaxing after a long day. Overall, we had a great stay."
8186,1182616,35161299,2015-06-15,35111136,Michael,"Peter's room was a great place to stay during our visit to Stockholm. Peter provided excellent communication with extremely detailed directions for getting to the apartment from the airport, and the room itself was spacious and clean. Plus the apartment is conveniently located right across the street from a Metro station, which made exploring the city a breeze. All in all I would definitely recommend staying with Peter if you're spending a few days in Stockholm.   "
8187,1182616,35274979,2015-06-16,11225410,I-Van,"Второй раз я останавливаюсь в комнате Питера 
Все попрежнему чисто и аккуратно 
все это ванна кухня комната а также большой удобный балкон 
соседи очень интересные приветливые люди а сам владелец хороший добрый человек 
рекомендую всем так как это находится прямо в центре стокгольма рядом с ратушей "
8188,1182616,35526628,2015-06-19,34927482,Jon,"Peter is a great host, with a wonderful apartment. Very accommodating!
Highly recommended!"
8189,1182616,35891690,2015-06-22,36143227,Shankar,It was a great place to stay during our visit to Stockholm. Peter provided excellent communication with extremely detailed directions for getting to the apartment. It was neat and clean too. Thank you Peter..!! 
8190,1182616,36057243,2015-06-24,22314683,Lyle,"Peter was a great host - he was very good at keeping in touch with us prior to arriving and during our stay. 

The apartment is very big, clean and functional. The shared bathroom is adequate and kitchen has everything you need. The bedroom is very large - with king size bed, couch, wardrobe and dresser. Our favourite part was the balcony - which is a great place to take in the long sunny evenings - Bonus! 

A bit of walk from the city centre - maybe about 25 minutes -  but a very good place to stay Stockholm."
8191,1182616,36151771,2015-06-25,12175239,Lucia,"We stayed with Peter for one night in Stockholm: he was very flexible with checkin/checkout so the whole experience was very seamless. The apartment is fully rented out by airbnb so we shared it with other two groups of people who were travelling as well, making it feel more hostel-like than staying with a host. That was more than okay for us as we knew our way around but maybe that is not the case for everyone. The apartment was nice and clean, with all the amenities we needed.

The location was okay - close to the metro stop so it is easy to get anywhere, it is on a busy street so a lot of places to eat/cafes however it definitely is not my favourite part of Stockholm. 

All in all, we enjoyed our stay, it was hassle-free and nice, exactly what we needed for one night. "
8192,1182616,37094461,2015-07-04,1183188,Elizabeth,"I didn't personally meet Peter, as we arranged an alternative way to get the keys, but what a great space! Really lovely room with a balcony centrally located in Stockholm. The bathroom space is shared, which can be challenging as there were 7-8 guests staying in the (3 room) apartment during my trip. Large shared kitchen area with lots of tourist brochures can be used for cooking or hanging out. "
8193,1182616,37192528,2015-07-05,30926022,Beth,"Peter's place was fine for the one night we stayed there. After toting  our luggage from central station to the train station near his apartment and down the street a few blocks, it was disappointing that the place was pretty warm with little air flow. The balcony is mostly enclosed by glass so opening the window doesn't get a breeze and there were no fans. Peter was a helpful host though with clear direction on getting in and gave us space once there. One thing we didn't realize was he sometimes has multiple air BB guests at one time. "
8194,1182616,37920938,2015-07-11,37630998,Matt,The room was as advertised. The location is good. I never met Peter but it was a nice and easy place to stay. There were two very lovely German girls staying in the room next to me as well. 
8195,1182616,38184238,2015-07-13,29735752,Janne Und Simon,"Die Kommunikation mit Peter war sehr gut, er hat schnell und präzise auf unsere Fragen geantwortet. Das Apartment ist sehr gut gelegen, 20 Minuten zur Fuß vom Hauptbahnhof oder noch schneller mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln zu erreichen.  Als wir ankamen war unser Zimmer noch nicht fertig gemacht und benutztes Handtuch und Bettwäsche vom Vormieter lagen noch im Zimmer (als wir zwischenzeitlich unterwegs waren wurden Handtücher und Bettwäsche dann gewechselt - die Person haben wir jedoch nie gesehen). 
Wir hatten eins der Balkon Zimmer; der Balkon ging zum Innenhof raus und es war sehr ruhig Nachts. Unser Zimmer war geht-so sauber, Badezimmer und Küche waren auch geht-so sauber (Hostel-Style). Küche war voll ausgestattet zum Kochen und mit übergebliebenen Essen ehemaliger Bewohner ( sowie Nudeln, Reis, Gewürze...). 

Peter haben wir in den drei Tagen nicht einmal gesehen. Andere Bewohner die wir kennen gelernt haben, haben Peter auch nie gesehen. Offensichtlich vermietet er die drei Zimmer des Apartments alle als airbnb Zimmer. 

Zu empfehlen für Leute die sich tagsüber und Abends nicht viel im Zimmer aufhalten wollen. "
8196,1182616,38767876,2015-07-18,34109730,Charles-Olivier,The host made us feel very welcomed and it was very well located.
8197,1182616,39463376,2015-07-23,5668630,Marcus,"It was ok overall and luckily I only stayed a single night, but the experience taught me to more closely read the reviews of a listing before making a final booking, as the description left out an important detail..

..that there are others living in the flat, and that the host does not live there himself.

I'm a host myself and try and take good care of my guests, from the moment they book to the moment they leave.  Perhaps the most memorable attribute was the instructions to, upon arrival, only *take one of the keys* taped underneath the carpet in front of the door.

I'm including this here in the interest of future guests feeling more safe in an otherwise shady apartment building."
8198,1182616,40183168,2015-07-28,23933430,Clémence,The host is super nice and welcoming. He answered right when we asked him for the place. The other guests were super cool. The apartment is really clean and convenient. I recommend this place.
8199,1182616,41049453,2015-08-03,1964505,Jose Luis,"Short but intense. Very easy to reach. Clean bathroom. A bit expensive for sharing an apartment with 2 other couples, but it was our decision to accept it."
8200,1182616,41678848,2015-08-08,18679579,Clarisse,"L'appartement est composé de trois chambres et une cuisine. Tout est régulièrement loué, ce qui fait qu'à notre arrivée, les poubelles n'étaient pas vidées, les lits non défaits, et il y avait dans la chambre 3 paires de draps usagés roulés en boule dans un coin... cela a donc été un peu décevant au premier abord.
Toutefois, l'arrivée a été très pratique, nous avons récupéré la clé facilement, et l'appartement est bien situé  (15 minutes à pied de Centralterminalem)."
8201,1182616,42151476,2015-08-11,17063451,Michael,"Der Vermieter hat schnell geantwortet und war unkompliziert und flexibel, was meine frühe An- und späte Abreise betraf. Seine Wegbeschreibung war sehr exakt und hilfreich. Die Location ist echt zentral, Busse und Metro fast direkt vor der Haustür, und in wenigen Minuten ist man so in der Innenstadt. Was man durch die Airbnb-Anzeige nicht erfährt: Der Vermieter wohnt nicht im Apartment, stattdessen werden alle 3 Zimmer vermietet. Zeitweise waren wir 7 Gäste, die sich ein Bad teilen mussten. Hauptproblem war, dass der ganze Ort (Küche, Zimmer und leider auch das Bad) nicht wirklich sauber waren. Es roch auch etwas merkwürdig. Ich war bei der Buchung froh, noch etwas Zentrales zu finden, das nicht allzu teuer war. Trotzdem würde ich dieses Zimmer nicht wieder buchen."
8202,1182616,42495151,2015-08-13,36942740,Neda,"The room was spacious enough for two, clean and centrally located. Very nice time in Stockholm. Thank you Peter! "
8203,1182616,43279424,2015-08-18,2950410,Monica,"We stayed one night and it was ok! The bed is extremely comfortable! Maybe for long term stay one toilet for 3 rooms could be a problem but except for that the house, the location and the host are perfect!"
8204,1182616,44886327,2015-08-30,6673479,Hannah,"Ich habe Peter erst bei meiner Abreise persönlich getroffen. Unser Kontakt war zuvor über SMS. Peter ist ein netter Typ. Er hatte in der Woche, in der wir da waren, wohl viel zu tun.
Angesichts dessen, dass er von der Vermietung der Wohnung lebt, hätte ich mir gewünscht, dass er öfter mal nach dem Rechten schaut, was die Sauberkeit des Bades und der Gemeinschaftsräume anbelangt."
8205,1182616,46021934,2015-09-07,41449588,Alexander,"Peter was a nice guy!

Everything was like he says in the description of the room, so there where no bad surprises!

The neighborhood has supermarkets and anything you need. And you can also walk everywhere to the centre and so on easily in 10 min.

All in all a nice place to stay :)"
8206,1182616,48364277,2015-09-25,651181,Ian,Shared flat which is new to me. A girl from Montreal and a guy from northern Germany were very cool. We had dinner and drank beers on the nice little balcony. Neighborhood is a good one. I slept well which is really all I needed so it worked out nicely.
8207,1182616,48481389,2015-09-26,43232003,Sam,Peter's apartment was in a great location downtown.  It was a very clean apartment with a private deck that was wonderful to stay at.  He was very easy to working with on checking in.
8208,1182616,49052927,2015-09-30,44344707,Sascha,"Das Zimmer und die Wohnung an sich waren sehr ordentlich und entsprachen der Beschreibung. Peter selbst war sehr freundlich und über die AirBnB Website oder per SMS erreichbar falls Fragen oder Probleme auftauchen sollten, dies war bei unserem Aufenthalt jedoch nicht der Fall.
Was noch anzumerken ist, ist dass Peter selbst nicht in der angebotenen Wohnung wohnt, alle 3 Räume der Wohnung sind an wechselnde Gäste vermietet. Hierdurch haben wir Peter recht selten angetroffen, was an dieser Stelle jedoch völlig neutral erwähnt sein soll. Auf Fragen, die ich im Vorfeld über die AirBnB Website gestellt habe hat er immer sehr schnell und freundlich geantwortet und war allgemein sehr hilfsbereit.
Bad und Küche waren ebenfalls stets sauber und gepflegt.
Der kleine Balkon war sehr schön, gerade wenn morgens die Sonne darauf schien.
Die Wohnung ist sehr zentral gelegen, wer gut zu Fuß ist kann sogar in die Innenstadt (Gamla Stan) laufen, dies haben wir an unserem ersten Tag getan, sonst jedoch lieber die 4/5 Haltestellen mit der Metro zurückgelegt, Bus und U-Bahn Haltestellen befinden sich nahe der Wohnung, ein Supermarkt ist ebenfalls nicht weit.

Allgemein war es ein sehr angenehmer Aufenthalt, ich würde Peter's Wohnung jederzeit weiterempfehlen.

It was other hosts in the house but it was any noise, it was very quiet. We didn't meet Peter but he was in contact with us all the time to see if everything was good so I felt good with him. The house is 20 minutes walk to the city center and also good options with bus."

A very good value for the location.

The neighborhood is not the most good looking but it is quite close to the station and it helped. We did not stay in the house much as we had few hours only to visit the city, but the room was clean and big.  "

8218,1182616,54768535,2015-11-23,14241218,Sujoy,"Christer was very welcoming and warm host. He was present when we arrived at his place. The apartment is located 15 mins from the centre of Stockholm. So location wise it was perfect. The apartment comprised of a kitchen with dining space, three bed rooms and a shared toilet and bathroom. I must highlight over here that if you are bag packing then it is probably an ok place for you. But if you are visiting with family then it is an absolutely ""no no"". First of all the basin was clogging all the time and it was very dirty. The bedroom which my parents were using did not have any room for movement after an extra mattress was added for me. I had initially thought that I would get a separate room with a proper bed. The cupboard was full of dirt and the floor was also not cleaned properly, though we were asked to take off our shoes while entering the house, which we did. All in all, it was not really a pleasant experience for me as well as for my parents."

Supermarkets and restaurants right outside. 15-20 minutes to old town, very conveniently located. There are 3 rooms in the apartment and we had 1 room. Room was very spacious and well-heated. Bathroom also very spacious. The apartment is on the 6th floor but there is an elevator :) "

We could leave our backpacks in the apartment the whole day while strolling through Stockholm and pick them up in the evening. "

The apartment is located at a good area and by a pleasant walking distance to the City Hall, Central Station and to the Old Town as well. We got what we expected for: Kitchen is well furnished, rooms are big enough and casual.
It was also a pleasure to meet with Peter. He is a friendly and helpful person and could suggest good program alternatives.
In brief I can only recommend to stay at this apartment once you are in Stokholm."

La localización si que es ideal, ya que esta perfectamente bien conectado y en un momento caminando, en metro o bus estás en los monumentos más importantes de Estocolmo. A Peter solo lo vimos una vez , unos pocos minutos, pero se porto muy amable con nosotros. Nos hubiera encantado poder compartir con él. Encontramos a faltar el Desayuno, clave fundamental en este sistema (AirB (breakfast)&B) y sobre todo, pensamos que todo hubiera sido ideal y estupendo si el baño hubiera estado limpio. Queremos quedarnos con lo bueno, pero hace falta una buena limpieza del piso en general y el baño en lo particular."

Peter was always nice, attentive and available for anything that we needed, providing a safe and enjoyable trip. 
The only thing less positive was the cleaning of the bathroom and room floor. 

Overall it was a great experience and we would definitely recommend it! 
Thanks Peter!  "
8237,1182616,62759340,2016-02-16,44477119,益柯,this house is near the city hall and very quiet. But we didn't see the landlord.

8242,1182616,64328771,2016-03-02,8523320,Hannah,Really good at communicating and answering promptly. Although we never got to meet Peter he was very accommodating and it was super easy getting around in the city from his apartment. Thumbs up for the tempur-pedic mattress and the sunny balcony :) There were however quite a few other people staying in the apartment at the same time which could make things a bit awkward. But if you're the social comfortable type it's no problem at all. 
8243,1182616,64906235,2016-03-09,59426765,Tamás,Great flat in the centre of the city. Peter gave us advices how to get to the accommodation. The view from the balcony is really good.

"
8251,1182616,69875579,2016-04-14,12734025,Hannes,"The description matches the actual situation quite well. There are some euphemizations here and there but nothing outrageous. However, it is interesting to know that all the rooms in the appartment are rented out here on Airbnb. Regardless whether that's something good or bad, it means that there will probably be more people staying than the appartment was designed for, which can lead to annoying queueing at the bathroom in the morning. Peter himself remained physically invisible during the entire process, but was responding quickly to questions asked by e-mail. "
8252,1182616,70547676,2016-04-18,44615127,Otto,"The room was really easy to find, even when Peter couldn't make it to welcome us. Good facilities, comfortable bed and a very cozy room. The linen, towels etc were perfectly set for us as we arrived. The private balcony was amazing, especially with the warm morning sun shining right in!"
8253,1182616,70690477,2016-04-19,45762453,Aaron,"Peter was very nice and although we were not able to meet him in person, he was very attentive and responsive to all of our messages. The place is not far from the center of Stockholm, and actually is quite nice to walk along the water to the historic center. Area itself is clean and pleasant, and all and all, we had a great time here. "
8254,1182616,71049276,2016-04-23,22312684,Kimberly,"The stay at this apartment was okay. The positive was the Location (close to water and only 2 stations from the City) and the balcony. Also the room was okay. 
But we use Airbnb to get insiders about a City and stay with People, who live in this City. This is not given at Peters Apartment, because Peter himself does not live there. Other Airbnb guests also stay there. So it can be noisy. Also the bathroom was dirty and stinky. It felt more like a Hostel than an Airbnb Apartment. 
For a short trip ist was ok."
8255,1182616,71568472,2016-04-26,63269554,Sara,"Apartment was in a good location, and the kitchen available was very useful. This was the first Airbnb we really felt at home. Big room and bed with a nice balcony. Check in and check out was a breeze."
8256,1182616,72584748,2016-05-03,17483586,Alex,"We shared the apartment with several tenants but in different rooms. We had a great time there. The kitchen, the restroom the balcony...we all love it. Peter never showed up but he'd been helpful for showing us the way from the city to the apartment. I would recommend this to other travelers ;)"
8257,1182616,73596157,2016-05-08,37379484,Sissel,"Peter communicated fast and had good description of how to get to the place. Its easy accessible with airportbus. The neighborhood was nice, in the center of Fridhemsplan with shops and all necessities close by. Personally I felt a better description of the actual flat could be nice as we where many people there, sharing one bathroom, although it worked out well as we had different routines and rhythms and the guests in the other two rooms where nice and had good sense of order. "
8258,1182616,73757754,2016-05-10,47237823,Marcus,Perfect apartment in central Stockholm! Everything went really smooth even though our notice was minimal. A great recommendation! 
8259,1182616,74525346,2016-05-15,364490,Gavin,"This was the second time we stayed with Peter, and once again we had a great time. Excellent location, perfect for a weekend away in Stockholm."
8260,1182616,75149360,2016-05-19,36662594,Tyler,Perfect little room for quick transition and to get over jet lag. Did not meet Peter but communicated well!
8261,1182616,75554270,2016-05-22,44302765,Flavio,"Excellent location, a lot of space, nice balcony, comfy beds, 3 supermarkets nearby.
The keys to the room are not so easy to use, they could be replaced with simpler ones.
Peter is very helpful and friendly, we highly recommend."
8262,1182616,76179073,2016-05-25,3395365,Erika,Excellent location and easy to find with Peter's directions!
8263,1182616,77916024,2016-06-04,29095351,Marina,Peter was a great host. It was really easy to get from the airport and its well located.  You hace everything you need un hus house. The room was as described as the picture. Its a nice place to stay.
8264,1182616,78623636,2016-06-07,3808794,Fabiana,"The location is good and the room is like it's written in the description, it's big and comfortable but it's not clean. Dust was everywhere on the furnitures and on the floor. We had to clean it ourselves to put our stuff. The bathroom is awful, smelly, not clean and what is worse is shared with all the people in the house, which can be 7 or 8 (it depends) and this is NOT clear in the description. We never met Peter but the communication with him was prompt. He rents the whole house to AirBnB guests, means 3 rooms totally 7 or 8 people and this is not in the spirit of Airbnb. Usually we go thru Airbnb to meet the owner of the house, talk to him, enjoy some common experiences and especially get infos about the city where we travel. This is not the case at Peter's place. The kitchen is big and you can have a nice breakfast there, but again it is not clean. Everything is left to the guests, so if you are lucky to find other guests who are clean, then it's ok, otherwise pity for you.... I think the owner, even if he doesn't live in the house, has to come and clean (at least the bathroom) and check if everything is fine, otherwise it looks like you are in an hostel. The smelly bathroom has a shower which is at the same level of the floor, so water is everywhere when you take a shower and you need to dry the pavement by yourself. This is my first bad experience at Airbnb after so many years! I don't recommend this appartment."
8265,1182616,80790408,2016-06-19,27823529,Lynette,"Room was very central walking distance to the city. Lots of Pubs, Restaurants. Supermarkets and shops all around and yet the apartment was quite.
You share with others who were all very nice. Peter responds to all text messages very quickly.  Our room had the balcony which was very nice.
The kitchen to share is very well equipped. 
We met Peter he is very nice. Comes in every day to do clean.
"
8266,1182616,81730598,2016-06-24,47329349,Tina,Der var altid hurtig kontakt med mail via Airbnb
8267,1182616,82160980,2016-06-26,74612548,Shellie,"The location was great...close to metro, parks and a lake. Easy to find and instructions from Peter very clear and easy to follow. Bathroom is shared but not a problem for us."
8268,1182616,84045952,2016-07-05,30853256,Keerthi Kumar,Communication with Peter worked well although we were not able to meet him personally. The apartment is located very close to the city hall and Gamla stan. 
8269,1182616,84196239,2016-07-06,42273271,Jessica,"Centralt och bra läge! Bra förklarat för att hitta dit och komma in till lägenheten. Det var även bra förberett med bäddad säng och handdukar. 
"
8270,1182616,84340190,2016-07-06,73990895,Chris,Judas the as advertised. Thoughtful host.
8271,1182616,84786353,2016-07-09,75683692,인희,"The location was good.
We couldn't meet Peter. But his respond
was quick.
구로치만 방이 먼쥐가 마나서 지져분해소 츄우천은 안하려어는 마음임."
8272,1182616,86589932,2016-07-17,72728267,Irene,We hebben via de mail contact gehad met Peter en hem helaas niet persoonlijk ontmoet. Ons bed was keurig opgemaakt en Peter hield ons op de hoogte van bijzonderheden. Er waren nog twee kamers verhuurd. De kamer met balkon kwam aardig overeen met de foto's. 
8273,1182616,86970359,2016-07-18,83801845,Reiner,"Me and my Friends stayed for 2 Nights in Stockholm, during this time Peter has been our Host.
He has a very sympatic appereance and he is a kind person. If you have a Question just ask him, he will answer you fluently in english so the conversation is without any problems. He also got some nice advices for you about Bars or the metro, which will be an advantage for you. Our room was comfortably and clean, during our Time at Peters appartment we had two neighbours, so we had to share the bath with them, but it was ok ,because everyone left the bathroom in a clean way. Our room has also a balcony which is very comfy. One big advantage was / is that Peters appartment is central, so you can drop off there easily with the bus from arlanda airport, without walking a long distance 

All in all Peter is a great Host!"
8274,1182616,89879656,2016-07-30,38471663,Tamarah,Peter was er niet toen we arriveerden maar had dit vooraf duidelijk gecommuniceerd en hij zorgde ervoor dat onze kamer in orde was aan het eind van de dag. Hoewel de keuken en het sanitair gedeeld was met 2 andere kamers was dit niet lastig. Een prima appartement voor een stedentrip.
8275,1182616,90636490,2016-08-01,24401227,Neil,"Peter is very kind and informed us very well to get from the airport to the city etc..... but unfortunately we never meet him..
We spent a Weekend in Stockholm for 3 nights and we were 3 persons. 

Appartment/Location:
It was a very lovley appartment in a good Location in the City. You can get to everything easily. The room in the appartment had enough space for three persons. There are two other rooms in the appartment where other persons are renting, so it could be that you will meet other travelers =)
When you are a relaxed person and don't expect a high class Hotel with a bathroom for every single person this is a nice opportunity for visiting Stockholm.

It was very nice for our weekend in this area! "
8276,1182616,93235682,2016-08-12,78516403,Lesley,"Host did make us feel welcome, the listing was accurate, but the apartment can have several guests staying at once and one bathroom with 8 people is extremely challenging. If you were on a strict schedule you might not have time to get a shower that morning. Kitchen was a little messy but could have been do to all the house guests. "
8277,1182616,93571206,2016-08-13,31061683,Isabella,It was a really nice stay in the Apartment! Peter was really friendly and caring! I would definitly recomnend it to everyone :) everything was exactly like in the discription and we were very happy!
8278,1182616,98011073,2016-08-29,75382703,Karin,"We enjoyed staying in this room in Stockholm. It is a good location not far from city centre and very quiet if your room is facing out the back. The kitchen was well equipped and the bedroom comfortable, the balcony very nice. We got on quite well with the other guests too."
8279,1182616,98887520,2016-09-02,19967029,Pablo,Amazing location. Easy to get from airport and from the city. Peter is a great host. Thank you!
8280,1182616,102696184,2016-09-18,57084277,Lyn,"Although Peter was out of the country during our stay, he was very helpful before our stay and answered questions we had.  He sent a very detailed description on how to find his house.  Nice neighbourhood central to everything."
8281,1182616,103977462,2016-09-25,17493109,Ed,"Great place to staying for a long weekend in Stockholm. It is basic but all essential things are available. Nice clean and comfortabel bed. Peter could not be there dring my weekend , but with his trust and amazing detailed massages it worked out perfectly. I would like to stay here a next time."
8282,1182616,104601796,2016-09-27,93181101,Jonathan,Peter is a lovely guy and did all he could to make us comfortable when we arrived. However there were eight people sharing one bathroom and toilet and there were some issues with cleanliness. Had we known the number of people sharing a small flat we would not have booked. The accommodation would suit backpackers who are looking for easy access to the city.
8283,1182616,106422597,2016-10-06,4561861,Stewart,"Although we didn't speak much face-to-face, Peter was always clear and prompt with his communication. The flat is well located, the bed was comfortable and the room spacious. However, although superficially clean, the flat was a bit dusty and grimy in places and being in the bathroom wasn't very pleasant as there was quite a strong smell from the drain for the shower. Also, some of the furniture was a bit tired. It is a shame because it is fundamentally quite a nice flat and would be much nicer place to stay were it thoroughly cleaned, some of the furniture replaced and the bathroom refitted with a U-bend on the shower to prevent drain odours."
8284,1182616,107058914,2016-10-09,40066800,Jin,"Nice location, comfortable room"
8285,1182616,107784677,2016-10-12,98516028,Theodore,Peter went way above and beyond. I left my suit at his apartment and he contacted my friend's uncle as well as delivered the suit to this uncle so he could deliver it to me in Malmö.
8286,1182616,108389536,2016-10-16,2264052,Ula,"Nice, clear, simple. Everything what you need. Thanks. "
8287,1182616,109066902,2016-10-19,38659801,Andrey," Хозяин очень приветливый, все было очень хорошо!!"
8288,1182616,110287710,2016-10-25,44455165,Yulia,Good location in the center of Stockholm! You even don't have to use public transport to walk around the old city. 
8289,1182616,110555647,2016-10-27,75767126,Indra,"Great place, confortable!! 

Thanks for everything "
8290,1182616,110907819,2016-10-29,43158293,Namhoon,it was not bad and the location was amazing. But you have to share kitchens and bathrooms with at least 5 people.
8291,1182616,111863037,2016-11-02,88636921,Xenia,"Peter is a nice guy, who isn't always with you in the flat. You have your privacy but you also go to meet new people. The City is right next to the flat so you can go by foot everywhere. Thanks for the nice time. :)"
8292,1182616,112703574,2016-11-07,5638369,Petri,"Peter's place is a very nice option if you don't mind sharing a bathroom with other guests (during our visit, there were three couples staying there). The kitchen is really nice, with all you need for making food, and there are two very good grocery stores just down the road. There's even an espresso coffee pot, which I especially appreciated! The Place is clean and the location could not be better for a Stockholm visit, with the airport bus stop just 50m from the front door and a Tunnelbana stop right there as well. We didn't meet Peter, but felt that he was right there to answer questions via email or SMS if you needed something. All in all, recommended for an easy-going, Airbnb-type stay."
8293,1182616,112988087,2016-11-09,33794565,Christian,Host was really nice and helped me out when I needed to get to airport by telling about close transportation! Overall great stay and would definitely recommend staying here! 
8294,1182616,115018837,2016-11-21,25249232,Roland,"Peter was a great host, he was really helpful and flexible. The apartment was clean and cozy, well-equipped and situated really good, the neighborhood is mostly quiet and in few minutes of walk you can find metro station, many shops, many restaurants, and in 15-20 minutes of walk you can already reach the city centre. Sharing only one bathroom with the other occupiers can be a little uncomfortable, the mornings can be little busy but anyway I can recommend this apartment for everyone, I would choose it next time too."
8295,1182616,115363038,2016-11-24,98686317,Felix,Sehr gute Lage. Unkomplizierter und reibungsloser Check-In und Check-Out. 
8296,1182616,115510736,2016-11-25,101501256,Louis,Nice and spacious place to spend a night. Peter is flexible. I recommand this place. 
8297,1182616,115640281,2016-11-26,19420360,Peijun (Sabrina),Peter's very tentative to accommodating my stay. He offered to let me check in upon my arrival and leave my luggage after check out hours. Awesome host! 
8298,1182616,116144907,2016-11-28,25565351,Michelle,"Peter's place was very comfortable and extremely convenient because it was close to a major subway station. Communication was easy, and he gave very clear instructions on how to get to/from the airport. One thing to keep in mind is that the apartment is shared, so if you want a private, quiet night, this may not be the best place for you."
8299,1182616,116387131,2016-11-30,103931448,April,"Peter's apartment has a good location, near metro, supermarket and department stores, just by walk you can get there, very convenient, I definitely suggest Peter's home!!!"
8300,1182616,116620050,2016-12-02,102067136,Vera,"Me and my friend really enjoyed staying at peter's place. The room itself is clean and spacious, and the neighborhood is very convenient. We were provided with everything stated in the ad, and although Peter wasn't there at the time of our arrival, our 'check-in' and 'check-out' went very smoothly."
8301,1182616,120670099,2016-12-11,7478984,Aoife,"We arrived at Peter's place in the middle of the night but he explained everything to us on how to get in so we didn't have any problems. Nice location, the room was perfectly prepared! Thanks Peter"
8302,1182616,120851081,2016-12-12,70304455,Tom,Everything was as described in the ad. The check in and check out went without any problems thanks to Peter's help.
8303,1182616,121318946,2016-12-16,46472111,Desiree,"We stayed in Stockholm for 4 nights and enjoyed it a lot. The apartment is very well located, right next to different shops (supermarket, bakery, café...) and a metro station.  We were satisfied with our room at Peters apartment and slept well. Kitchen is well equipped, but could use a bit more cleaning. 
I would recommend this apartment for everyone who is looking for an affordable place to stay on a great location in  Stockholm, if you are fine with a rather simple interior. "
8304,1182616,121834278,2016-12-19,77591218,Lydie,"Peter is very nice and gentle,he told us every details which was so useful and careful,and the location of the house is very good,it's easy to take the bus and the metro, maybe the only problem is that wifi is not very fast when all the people use it "
8305,1182616,122088260,2016-12-21,43178925,Simin,The flat is cozy and tidy.
8306,1182616,122562813,2016-12-24,63393411,阳,"Peter is very nice and the room is comfortable, it's close to the subway."
8307,1182616,122839643,2016-12-26,107981868,Xiaodong,The room was not cleaned when I checked in. The transportation and shopping are very convenient around.
8308,1182616,123233781,2016-12-28,56049177,Alejandro,"The place is on the main street,close to subway station and there's many shops on the street. It's a nice place in Stockholm. The room is big enough for three persons. It's close to city center, 15 mins to city hall. I recommend to purchase a 24hours traffic cards. There's a nice Thai food restaurant cross street. Peter is very friendly and helpful. A nice experience!"
8309,1182616,125181239,2017-01-04,88326592,Maaike,"We had a nice stay, the check-in and check-out were really easy. Wifi was good as well. There's a metro station around the corner, which I took to get in the centre, its just a few stops but walking is definitely too far. "
8310,1182616,125694494,2017-01-07,25168895,Pin-Cheng,"My girlfriend and I stayed in Peter's place for 3 nights. The location is excellent in snowing days like this, it's only 3 mins away from the subway station and at least 2 supermarket can be reached in 2 mins by walk. The room is cozy with a nice balcony, the house also have a full functional kitchen with everything tenants might need. I would definitely pay a visit back here when I am coming to Stockholm next time."
8311,1182616,128259982,2017-01-23,109145895,Pierre,"Nous avons passé un très bon moment dans l'appartement de Peter. 
Nous pouvons arriver à n'importe quelle heure , ça ne pose pas de problème . L'appartement est très bien desservi par les transports en communs mais surtout tout est faisable à pied avec de bonnes chaussures !!! 
La chambre est très agréable avec son balcon privé , il y a une grande cuisine commune. Les autres parties communes sont très correctes ! 
L'immeuble n'est pas bruyant et le lit est très confortable (ce qui est non négligeable après une grosse journée de marche à pied) 

Je recommande fortement ce logement de très bon rapport qualité/emplacement/prix!"
8312,1182616,128879704,2017-01-28,2688674,Melissa,Friendly host. 
8313,1182616,130513654,2017-02-06,61414488,Vero,l appartement est vraiment très bien situé pour visiter Stockholm  . lit tres confortable manque peut être une tv dans la chambre pour les news et les soirées au chaud!!!!!! et un seul petit truc c est que le frigo mériterait un ptit coup de nettoyage  sinon  très bien. ...
8314,1182616,130901662,2017-02-09,108571404,Ann,The location is good with easy access to local shops and restaurants. The room itself is cool and cozy. 
8315,1182616,131017291,2017-02-10,48267302,Kim,"Peter, is a super professorial host. I can recommend the please"
8316,1182616,131681134,2017-02-13,69668645,Lavina,"Peters flat is centrally located and therefore a great place to stay. Rooms are still quite though. 
We didn't meet Peter in person (he doesn't live in this flat, all three rooms are shared on airbnb) but communication through airbnb messenger was good and responsive. 
It's possible to reach the central station within 15-20 minutes. 
Shower isn't really separated from the rest of the bathroom, which is worth mentioning for people who didn't see that before. 
"
8317,1182616,132167755,2017-02-16,111630827,Albert,"Good location and reachable host, though he doesn't live in the property. Flat has two rooms and a repurposed living room which are all rented out on Airbnb, so it can get a bit crowded. "
8318,1182616,132348650,2017-02-17,19170608,Ryan,Peter was very communicative! Great clean room. 
8319,1182616,133868030,2017-02-25,116189600,Romuald,Hôte très disponible et chambre conforme à la description 
8320,1182616,134462401,2017-02-27,20252834,Mark,Cheap and cheerful. Great place for small groups spending a weekend. 
8321,1182616,134818152,2017-03-01,114839984,Дарья,"I enjoyed it, but ability to make some neighbors can be settled very late at night, and burst into the room."
8322,1182616,135445353,2017-03-05,38370003,Max,Peter was great!
8323,1182616,136548395,2017-03-11,98540299,Chinatsu,"Good location.
He always reply my question quickly. That was so helpful. The size of the room and the bed was perfect for two people."
8324,1182616,137255689,2017-03-14,19612126,Saqib,Great Place if you want to be in best part of Stockholm
8325,1182616,138257656,2017-03-19,83376981,Jorge,"I am disappointed with the apartment. Peter is not living in the house, and the flat works like a hostel. You have to share the bathroom with 8 people, and even more if new guests arrives (our case). The bathroom smells and it's not clean due to the number of guests using it. There is not living room as it is used as another room for 4 people."
8326,1182616,138535538,2017-03-20,92123197,Marc,Peter is a very welcoming person. The appartment is very nice. Just one thing : the shower should be fixed because the water is going all over the bahroom.
8327,1182616,139379976,2017-03-25,59620544,Nick,"Nice apartment in a good location. Transit stop nearby, 20 minute walk to city center area. Two other rooms in the apartment are rented out so can be loud at times. Peter communicated very well about check in/check out/getting into the apartment/etc. Great host "
8328,1182616,143953438,2017-04-14,75457283,Anne,"Well located in Stockholm. The metro station is on the other side of the street. Lots of convenience around. The apartment is quiet at night, bed is comfortable. Peter doesn't live there, we never met him. We found at one point the place was too crowded. The are 2 bedrooms and the living rooms are all rented. In the living room he rents the place for 4 and more people. At one point we were 8 people in the place with only one bathroom, it was a bit too crawded."
8329,1182616,144581243,2017-04-16,62534967,Olia,"The place is very nice and the location is perfect - close to the public transport and the bus to the airport, and walking distance from the center. Great value for the money! Would definitely recommend to stay there if you want to discover Stockholm. "
8330,1182616,145670973,2017-04-19,99986987,Omar,"Peter was very flexible regarding check in and check out which helped us alot. The location is close to public transport and to supermarkets and restaurants. Our room had a nice balcony towards the morning warm sun. The apartment is well equipped. The only downside is that three rooms are sharing one bathroom, almost 6-8 people."
8331,1182616,146055336,2017-04-21,21295429,Pascal,"Peter has been a great host. Very fast to answer for any information needed, the room was exactly as expected, everything needed was there, the appartement is easy to find, close from the center and from the central train station or the airport shuttle. 
It was a pleasure, thank you ! "
8332,1182616,146986741,2017-04-24,98779719,Matthias,Lovely stay!
8333,1182616,147356541,2017-04-26,51414522,Xinyan,"Peter's house is in the center. It's quite convenient from airport to his house. There is a balcony in the room, and we can also use the kitchen!"
8334,1182616,147547088,2017-04-27,18329663,Christophe,"L'appartement est très bien situé avec de nombreuses commodités alentours.
Ce logement s'adresse surtout à un public jeune car cela ressemblait assez à une auberge de jeunesse.
Peter est très accueillant et répond à toutes les questions même s'il n'est pas sur place.

"
8335,1182616,149651667,2017-05-05,11112937,Wieke,"Appartement prima voor paar dagen. Vraag de kamer met balkon die is het fijnst! Prima keuken. Je moet t geen probleem vinden om de badkamer te delen. En geluk hebben met rustige mede gasten, en dat hadden wij dus prima! Lokatie is perfect en leuke buurt. "
8336,1182616,150198125,2017-05-07,17318489,Erik,"Peter's appartment is nicely situated in Stockholm, about 10 minutes walking from the city center. The appartment is not very new but fine. The bed is comfortable and the balcony is surely wonderful in summer. However, we were surprised to find six other people were staying in the two other rooms in the three-room appartment. This meant that we had to wait for about an hour to shower each morning. This situation could have been made more clear in the advertisement. The appartment feels more like a hostel. Additionally, if you are a light sleeper, then watch out because the walls are quite thin and with so many people there is some noise. Concluding, it is an okay appartment in a good location but with too many guests."
8337,1182616,150628716,2017-05-08,70819339,Filip,"Gick att lösa på väldigt kort varsel. Skönt ställe!
"
8338,1182616,152211795,2017-05-15,90249171,Kee,"convenience location, easy access by metro. Multiple guests share the same apartment, only one bathroom and bathroom has odors. Floor is not clean, but host requests the guests to remove their shoe. "
8339,1182616,154428348,2017-05-24,37504533,Subha,A lively place well located and close to all types of public transport. Peter was extremely prompt in the communication and made it super comfortable for us at his place. I will recommend this place to all. This place feels like home!
8340,1182616,156370110,2017-05-30,32322928,Richard,"Peters apartment is great and easy to access. 10 minutes from the central station, city centre and the old town. Peter was a wonderful host and went way beyond to welcome us. There are 3 good bedrooms with a balcony but sadly had only one bathroom. Else the place was simply the best. I'd definitely recommend Peter's apartment and it's superb value for money."
8341,1182616,162330521,2017-06-20,28491567,Daniel,"Although I didn't meet Peter during my stay he provided excellent directions to the flat 

It's a two bedroom flat converted into a 3 airbnb rooms which could get cramped (though wasn't when I visited)

The room could have been cleaner when I arrived but was okay  "
8342,1182616,163732752,2017-06-25,82371597,Yukari,Peter is kind!!
8343,1182616,164658050,2017-06-28,135780283,Edward,"Peter's place is in a great location. Located in a calm neighbourhood within a close distance to the center, seaside strolls and nice restaurants."
8344,1182616,165271853,2017-06-30,17870787,Kira,"Die Lage der Wohnung ist gerade für Reisende vom oder um Flughafen ideal. Das Zimmer sah wie auf den Bildern aus und war sauber. Leider war es mir nicht klar das noch eine weitere Gruppe in der Wohnung wohnt. Ich bin mir nicht sicher ob die Sauberkeit der Wohnung an der anderen Gruppe lag oder es dort immer so aussieht. Die Kommunikation war schnell und unkompliziert, doch leider haben wir den Gastgeber nie gesehen"
8345,1182616,166068684,2017-07-02,134755082,Charles,Nice place ! 
8346,1182616,167545767,2017-07-07,10901921,Carrie,"Very close to public transportation, right next to grocery store, shops, and restaurants. There were also a few nice parks nearby. If you like to walk, it's only a half-hour walk to Gamla Stan and lots of museums.  Peter was very nice and accommodating. The check-in/check-out process was super flexible and easy.  I would definitely stay here again. "
8347,1182616,168284223,2017-07-09,92040026,Pedro,Anfitriões simpáticos. Muito bom preço por valor porque usei o desconto. Tem uma boa varanda. Perto da estação de comboios e do centro. Quarto e casa de banho deviam estar mais limpos. No geral gostei pois queria acima de tudo algo barato. 
8348,1182616,169382475,2017-07-12,85049994,Dan,Great location and a very nice and helpful host! It was a pleasure to stay at Peter's!
8349,1182616,170261089,2017-07-15,72501488,Anastasia,"Toppen läge på lägenheten! Vårt rum hade fönster ut mot innegården, så det var lugnt trots att vi befann oss i centrum. Perfekt kommunikation, värden var väldigt hjälpsam och flexibel."
8350,1182616,171285114,2017-07-17,10228296,Aleksander,"Peter has a great place which is located centrally in Stockholm. The room is rustic but has everything you need, including internet.  If youre staying for a few days and are looking for a relatively inexpensive accommodation close to the center, then this is the place for you.

Peter was very helpful and responded quickly, despite not being personally in the country."
8351,1182616,172580962,2017-07-21,136028246,Louise,"Super appartement avec un balcon privé dans la chambre. Bien situé, nous avons visité toutes les parties de la ville à pied. Peter n'était pas là, mais il répond rapidement aux messages si besoin! 
Je recommande :)"
8352,1182616,177590073,2017-08-03,84284772,Oda Martine,"Had an ok stay at Peters apartment. The apartment was a bit dirty, and the bathroom should have been cleaned more often. It would have been nice to change the hand towle more often too. Nice and quiet place with under 30 min walking distance to the city. "
8353,1182616,180038998,2017-08-09,54639689,Monica,"Peter's place was great! A quick 10 minute ride to the center and less than 5 minute walk to the train. There is a coffee shop, pharmacy, and 7/11 really close by. Quick eateries as well. Peter is easy to communicate with and totally accommodating. He let me leave my bags in his hallway since I had a late flight which allowed me to enjoy Stockholm for an extra day!  Beautiful view from the apartment and super comfy bed. Peter is so kind to give towels as well! I am coming back to Stockholm in a few days and wish I could stay at his place again!"
8354,1182616,182617933,2017-08-15,23996391,Mia Hostels,"Peter was extremely precise with the indications, and the place was alright. Recommended :)"
8355,1182616,183412583,2017-08-17,25527027,Nicola,"Peter was available for the check-in and give us the right information to arrive and entry in the room without him. The only thing, but very important, is the level of cleaning. If you put as a rule that you have to take off your shoes you must clean the floor, if not this rule have no sense. The same thing with the bathroom. If you want to rent a room you have to take care about the cleaning of the house. We hope that this feedback will be useful for the future because Stockholm is a very beautiful city to visit and we will suggest it to our friends."
8356,1182616,185235725,2017-08-21,31291734,Eline,Nice room and great location. Balcony with windows which is nice in case of rainy weather. Communicatie with Peter went well. Bed is huge and comfy. Only minor thing was that sharing the bathroom with only toilet with all 5 people in the house (including guests in of het room) was not always convenient in the morning and evening. But apart from that a great stay!
8357,1182616,185657517,2017-08-22,145921683,Gesh,Peter is an amazing host so easy going that leaves the impression that you've known him your entire life. I definately recommend him.
8358,1182616,186627004,2017-08-25,137585425,Minseung,very kind and good
8359,1182616,188159992,2017-08-28,120538506,Rachel,"Appartement bien situé, quartier agréable avec bars et restos à proximité.
Nous n'avons pas eu la chance de croiser Peter mais toutes les intructions & infos nécessaires nous ont bien été transmises.
Aménagement intérieur basique.
Précision : les autres chambres de l'appartement peuvent être utilsées par d'autres locataires, notre colocation s'est très bien passée."
8360,1182616,188967685,2017-08-31,142166181,Orso-Manuel,"Peter is a reliable and very kind host.
The room is convenient, the neighbourhood is pleasant and close enough to the heart of the city (walk 10 mn to reach the City Hall, 20 mn for the Old Town).
Highly recommended !"
8361,1182616,190115267,2017-09-03,133998643,Alba&JoanMarc,"We don't recommend this appartment. They have another room for like 5 people. The three nights we stayed there: The other people were really dirty (specially in the bathroom), the other nights they arrive late at night laughing and making a lot of noise, they even rang the bell at 3am.
We paid a lot of money and we wanted to sleep at night to visit Stockholm early in the morning. 
Everything was really uncomfortable for us.
Peter was really nice when we sent him emails explaining the situation, and we know that he came to clean several times, but the bathroom was dirty as soon as the other family used it. 
I am sorry, but we don't recommend it, we would never go there again."
8362,1182616,191568169,2017-09-08,145098775,Anna Maria,"The location of the appartment was excellent. It was really easy to reach it at to move around. It is next to a metro station, a super market and a lovely park."
8363,1182616,192785298,2017-09-11,98117494,Maria,"Nice, kind, welcoming host and easy check in/check out. Quite good location. But wow, so dirty. The host had a very busy week with family errands and didn't have time to clean, I understand, but then he should hire cleaning services. The bathroom looked and smelled like it wasn't swabbed for months or years. I used toilet paper to wipe up water from the bathroom floor, it turned black!? Shower was dirty. The kitchen floor was filthy too. For us three girls this was very disturbing. Towels and bedsheets were provided and clean, but when we arrived to the room the previous guests bedclothes were still covering the bed.

Also, at this time it isn't clear from the description that you are renting a ROOM, not an apt, and others also renting rooms at the same time. This is only clear from reading reviews.

Overall, not good value for the money in my opinion although the location is quite good. I believe I paid a cleaning fee too which is very confusing."
8364,1182616,203457650,2017-10-15,150166588,Camille,"Peters place was very nice and well kept, the location was very comfortable and there were several things to do nearby! I would definitely stay here again"
8365,1182616,206846263,2017-10-27,79674623,Charlene,Appartement bien placé et spacieux. Un hôte très réactif aux messages.
8366,1182616,210212415,2017-11-08,18514786,Christine,Peter's apartment is very well located. There are 3 airbnb rooms but we were alone the whole time. It's easy to communicate with Peter. I agree with the comment that it's a bit like a youth hostel which was perfect for us.
8367,1182616,211585109,2017-11-13,20952450,Matthieu,"Peter give us warm welcome and is flat is cosy and well located close to subway station.
The travel experience is also depending of other people staying in the two other rooms of the flat."
8368,1182616,212766158,2017-11-19,61344456,Felix,Peters appartment is perfectly located and very flexible for check-in and out. There are also other guests in the other room but they were not really interacting with us so it always felt as it we had the appartment only on our own. Peter came by every day to check if everything is good do necessary cleaning and bring out the waste so everything was in a perfect condition. I would choose this place again if I come to visit Stockholm the next time.
8369,1182616,213977975,2017-11-24,31216417,Ellen,"Asunto sijaitsee hyvällä alueella kaikkien palveluiden ja kulkuyhteyksien vieressä. Saimme selkeät ohjeet ja kaikki toimi oikein hyvin. Asunnossa oli lisäksemme toiset vieraat sekä Peter, mutta emme kohdanneet toisiamme. Suosittelen rennoille kaupunkimatkaajille!"

8371,1182616,218518763,2017-12-13,11360544,Isabelle,"Peter is a very nice host and the apartment is well located near all public transportation.
Just take into consideration that there are 3 rooms in total and depending of your neighbors it could be quiet or noisy .
Thankfully for us , we had only one night with disturbing others guests."

8373,1182616,226345256,2018-01-10,26173473,Sandra,Perfekt och prisvärt läge. Stenkast till buss och tunnelbana. Mysig balkong. Boendet delas med andra personer.
8374,1182616,227280403,2018-01-14,62306730,Chloé,The apartment is well located (near the subway station and the bus to go to the airport). Peter was very reactive even if we didn't see him. The bathroom needed a bit of cleaning but that's maybe because we shared the place with other guests.
8375,1182616,231063337,2018-01-30,49111524,Kálmán,Peter's apartment was located well and was all-in-all well suited for our short stay.
8376,1182616,232141842,2018-02-04,14274621,Leonardo,"Peter was easy to communicate with, friendly and accommodating. The apartment is central located and close to public transportation."
8377,1182616,233567415,2018-02-10,150657692,Amdas,"這個房間有家庭的感覺,適合2-6個人,而且有廚房,在昂貴的北歐是不能缺失,我也是每天在附近買材料回去煮,比起餐廳便宜得多了｡這裡的交通很方便,樓下就有地鐵站和巴士站,機場直接前來可以乘坐彩虹巴士,去各大景點都很便利,步行去市中心也只是三十分鐘,可以在飯後散步｡這裡是個住宅區,有很多生活用品都容易買到｡屋主peter為人很好,相當友善,也樂於解答我也疑問和困難,也對我的行程作出建議｡"
8378,1182616,234278561,2018-02-12,46349169,Ianis,The flat is really nice and it is well located to visit Stockholm. Too bad it was freezing to properly enjoy the balcony

8381,1182616,236396205,2018-02-19,163075482,Andrew,"Great location, and the host was very good."
8382,1182616,238175523,2018-02-25,35633542,Léa,"Les plus : Le logement de Peter est très bien situé, à deux minutes à pied du métro Friedemsplan et de la navette pour l’aéroport d’Arlanda. 
Plusieurs supermarchés et magasins se trouvent au pied de l’immeuble. 
Peter est très sympathique et arrangeant, même si nous ne l’avons pas rencontré. Nous avons pu laisser nos bagages dans l’appartement avant de reprendre notre à avion pour Paris. 
Les moins : l’appartement n’est pas très propre. À notre arrivée, le drap de notre lit était couvert de cheveux et poils en tous genres. Il y a de fortes odeurs de canalisations dans la salle de bains, où la poussière n’a pas été faite depuis longtemps. Les placards de la cuisine ne sont pas très propres non plus. 
Enfin, il faut bien noter que le salon de l’appartement a été transformé en chambre par Peter, ce qui n’est pas indiqué dans l’annonce. Il y a donc trois chambres qui peuvent accueillir jusqu’à 8 personnes dans l’appartement... pour une seule salle de bains, ce qui peut créer des bouchons les soirs et matins."
8383,1182616,239534650,2018-03-02,156186982,Abby,"Peter is a really great host, but the stay itself was pretty bad. We weren’t told that there would be other guests in the apartment until after we had already booked and to top that off, they started having really loud sex in the next room. The walls are paper thin and you can’t even talk at regular volume without it going through the walls, let alone having loud sex or guests coming in after midnight being extremely noisy and rude. It makes sleeping and relaxing difficult. The room itself wasn’t very clean. The floor had a lot of dust and whatnot on it and it smelled strongly of smoke even though it says no smoking in the room. The bathroom reeked the entire time we were there. It was almost unbearable sometimes to use it. There was also the start of mold on the bathroom wall.  We definitely would not stay again."
8384,1182616,240242293,2018-03-04,76734300,Marton,"Good location, cozy appartment and easy communication."
8385,1182616,241465159,2018-03-09,121602998,Margaret,"We had no trouble finding Peter’s accommodation.  Public transport was easy, 3 blocks from metro and bus top was around the corner.  We reached city hall using bus no 3. Vasa museum and Gamla Stan was easily reached via public transport. Peter was nice enough to buy a weight scale so that we won’t have a problem in the airport with heavy luggage.  I used the kitchen for cooking breakfast eggs.  Grocery and restaurants were all around. All in all a good stay and very responsive host.  I would not hesitate renting this space again."
8386,1182616,242583072,2018-03-12,154902807,Alex,Great host. Very quick on responses and very helpful. Would stay again

8391,1182616,255996473,2018-04-22,17161167,David,"Peter's place is ideally located only a couple of minutes walk from the Fridhemsplan metro station, which made commuting around Stockholm a breeze! Peter had left us travel cards (which can be used on metro/bus/ferries etc) which we just topped up (cheapest option was the 72 hours for 250 Krona) and explored! Some fab local places to eat and walking along the coastal paths was beautiful. Went for morning runs along the water's edge - a whole lap of the island Fridhemsplan sits on is 9km ... a fab way to start the day! Peter is very responsive to any messages sent and made our stay effortless. Thank you!"
8392,1182616,259651438,2018-05-01,13846202,Camila,Excellent communication with the host and location.

8395,1182616,265406921,2018-05-17,13594226,Tj,Clean and great location
8396,1182616,270397785,2018-05-29,12891025,Akshay,"Pros:
-Close to Fridehelmsplan metro station, some lovely restaurants and a picturesque park.
- Close to the city centre...About 5 mins from Stockholm central and 10 mins from Gamla Stan.
Cons:
-The room was dirty...Almost every area slightly inaccessible to a broom had dust gathered (below the bed, the corners, furniture, etc)
-The host doesn't live here...I was under the impression that he does through our communication but didn't meet him even once for the 3 days I was there.
-Had reached after a 15 hr flight at around 4pm to find the room wasn't ready...Had to wait until 7 pm until it was habitable. So much for a 3pm check in.
- Bathroom is shared by three (Website hidden by Airbnb) you can imagine the inaccessibility. We were lucky that the other guests didn't wake up too early but I would imagine it would get difficult at most times.
- Bathroom sink kept on clogging up...Which was pretty nauseating. The shower cabinet is pretty (Website hidden by Airbnb) only 5'11 but still found it difficult navigating the place. 
-The balcony is not really a private (Website hidden by Airbnb) divided by a curtain between your room and the next. There isn't a door for the next room but a window into the balcony which meant a person could get access to your room through this area. For this reason, we had to lock the doors at night which made it pretty claustrophobic."
8397,1182616,273151075,2018-06-05,116565723,Donata,"Apartment location is very good.  Host is very communicating and matey. There is all gear you may need - wifi, iron, refrigerator, fan. But in this apartment with single bathroom can be accommodated more than 7 people. Also it is not very clean and well-lit apartment."
8398,1182616,274989943,2018-06-10,129906732,Anke,"Die LAge der Wohnung ist zentral und gut erreichbar. Leider schlafen aber zuviele Kunden in dieser Wohnung. 7 Personen sind eindeutig zuviel Bewohner für eine Wohnung mit nur einem Bad inkl. Toilette.
Der Vermieter hat vorgeschlagen, dass man in der Not in unten gelegene Restaurant gehen kann. Das ist aber leider morgens noch nicht geöffnet."

8403,1182616,285187407,2018-07-03,198033453,Jill-Siri,"This is a nice place, easy to get to-and  from Arlanda, and not too far away from the inner city. The appartment could have been a little bit cleaner, and with so many guest at the same time, it was some waiting for using the  bathroom/shower/toilett.  The balcony was a nice place for breakfast!The host didnt live there but was easy to get to if needed☺"
8404,1182616,289812174,2018-07-13,33912369,Mikkel,Great host
8405,1182616,297046404,2018-07-27,128891295,Anne,Vi har været i Peters lejlighed i 3 nætter. Den levede ikke op til vores forventninger. Peter har helt ret
8406,1182616,303381080,2018-08-07,67764037,Wendong,"Peter is a very kind person who is  ready to help you. And give you what you needed help.  He gave me flexible check in and check out . The house is in good place, walking distance to underground station and department store / supermarket. Strongly recommend to you."
8407,1182616,306872606,2018-08-13,77070625,Clément,"Sejour agréable , situe non loin du centre ! Parfait pour y séjourner quelques jours ! Merci bien :))"
8408,1182616,309470185,2018-08-18,156414067,Colette,"L'appartement est situé dans un quartier sympa. Mais la façon dont les hôtes sont traités, à savoir comme du bétail à faire de l'argent à la chaîne, ne donne pas vraiment envie de rester dans l'appartement. La salle de bain était sale à mon arrivée, et l'est restée pendant 48h (toilettes avec tâches douteuses dans et sur le bord de la cuvette). Des serviettes, certainement des hôtes précédents, amoncelées dans un coin. Des meubles entreposés, un lit dans le corridor déjà étroit, un autre meuble coincé dans un côté de la cuisine, elle aussi déjà étroite : pas d'espace commun à proprement dit. 1 salle de bain (avec toilettes) pour 3 chambres pouvant accueillir jusqu'à 6 personnes. Une usine donc, à faire de l'argent sur le dos des jeunes, rien de très charmant pour passer des vacances, ni pour un voyage professionnel comme c'était mon cas. "
8409,1182616,313435619,2018-08-25,2387197,Raphael,Nice place. Peter was very nice and helpful.

8411,1182616,315670015,2018-08-29,161555740,Sergi,Great adventure at Peter's place he is really nice Host. Nice place near the city centre and nice neighbourhood. You have all you need around!  
8412,1182616,316978319,2018-09-01,179599462,John Mark,The price is not worth the stay.
8413,1182616,324985932,2018-09-18,96298702,Catherine,Good location just not very clean
8414,1182616,329513650,2018-09-29,216942198,Peter J,"As others have mentioned, flat has 3 rooms advertised separately on airbnb. So be aware that there may be quite a number of other people in (check with the host well beforehand). There's only one bathroom. It's  a good stay in terms of location and public transport access. Room door wasn't lockable (bathroom was). All in a good budget place."
8415,1182616,330950027,2018-10-01,217594105,Jasmin,"The location of the apartment was good, the metro is nearby. Own balcony was also good. I did not just like staying with other people but otherwise the apartment was ok.. :)"
8416,1182616,346088447,2018-11-07,200989677,Leon,"The location of the apartment is great, it's close to the bus and metro stations. Supermarkets are also just around the corner. Peter is great host and responded real fast to questions.  The shared bathroom can form a problem when multiple guests are staying at the same time."
8417,1182616,349330885,2018-11-17,122529848,Alexandre,Perfect

8421,1182616,352511844,2018-11-25,21118830,Shabnam Sam,"Not what we expected, this was more of a hostel situation than coming into a persons home. Noise from other guests were also an issue for us."
8422,1182616,353263241,2018-11-27,226085439,Mark,Great apartment and great host!

8429,1182616,413235572,2019-02-17,230320885,Molnár,"Peter was very kind and helpful. The accommodation was also great, in a  good location. I could mention only one strange thing: we didn't expect more guests to come to the apartment outside of us. We thought just Peter (and his family maybe) will be there and us.  I didn't see any information about ""more airbnb guest""  while  booking. (Maybe my attention has been avoided. In that case I'm sorry). Otherwise, this was not an issue."
8430,1182616,421803253,2019-03-10,153826016,Daniel,Really nice place to stay and amazing location in Stockholm
8431,1182616,425403886,2019-03-18,114207682,Georges,"The apartment is correctly located (not is city center but it is known as from the start). Peter is very reactive and the check-in is easy.

On the other side, the apartment was really dirty during our stay (mid March 2019), especially the bathroom. Also, it was not clear from the start but Peter does not live in the apartment.

If clean in the future: good value for money and I would recommend.

If not clean: I would not recommend"
8432,1182616,430347670,2019-03-30,247595150,Stephie,Good
8433,1182616,431933305,2019-04-02,56175400,Marcelle,"Place is really well located, really close to the subway and in a walkable distance from the city center for those who enjoy walking. Peter was a great host and told us a few nice sightseeing places."
8434,1182616,433930622,2019-04-07,175828282,Nicoleta,"The location of this accommodation was perfect, just 2-4 subway stations to the central station. Peter was always helpful and kind. The room was enough for 2 persons provided it has a balcony, the only bad part was that the bathroom was not quite clean and the sink (which was also pretty dirty) and the shower was clogged and there was a bad smell generally in the bathroom."
8435,1182616,437144235,2019-04-14,20635342,Teresa,"A 20 min walk from the city center and with all amenities around, Peter's apartament is a nice choice if you don't want to spend a lot in you trip. Make sure you don't mind sharing the bathroom with other guests (there are two other rooms)."
8436,1182616,438719085,2019-04-17,85319716,Tang,"Nice place 
Nice view 
Great location 
Good communication"
8437,1182616,443525071,2019-04-26,45776625,Himanshu,Peters place is very well located quite convenient to get around. Although I didn't have much interaction with peter the one time we met he was very friendly and warm. The room is as advertised clean and spacious.
8438,1182616,445974021,2019-04-30,149425302,Takuro,"Nice host, comfortable room!
Everything was good to stay."
8439,1182616,448400125,2019-05-05,40907230,Atsuko,"Location is really comfortable. To be honest, the rooms (bedroom, bathroom and kitchen) wasn't  so clean, but Peter was so nice that he took actions as soon as possible when I mentioned about it. The big problem was we didn't know that there were other guests in the same house. I think it should be noted on the explanation of Airbnb web site. Sometime they were very noisy and we didn't get enough sleep. This could be the trouble so I hope it get fixed."
8440,1182616,451101194,2019-05-11,160336854,Anna,It was good! Great location and nice communication) But neighbors at the apartment were really noisy and there was a little bit of the dust. I might recommend this place for short stay)
8441,1182616,453552753,2019-05-16,30181513,Diana,Rummet är väldigt prisvärt och lägenheten har ett centralt läge i Stockholm. Peter var väldigt vänlig och svarade snabbt på alla mina frågor. Jag skulle definitivt bo i denna lägenhet igen när jag besöker Stockholm i framtiden! :)
8442,1182616,454887957,2019-05-19,193661990,Colette,"Easy to access - never met Peter, but he gave us a great explanation on text on how to reach and access/exit the apartment. We were 3 couples living there, so a bit of waiting for the bathroom in the mornings. But when you are on holiday that is a minor thing. Great place situated very near the central train station and beautiful surroundings."
8443,1182616,458644811,2019-05-26,19268751,Dorota,Peter is very good host. Apartment was nice and close to the Gamla Stan. :)
8444,1182616,465265248,2019-06-07,115219193,Carl Victor,Bra läge och Peter var supertrevlig. Ganska många som bodde i andra rum i lägenheten vilket skapade lite köer på morgonen främst. Trevligt rum med balkong :)
8445,1182616,466303406,2019-06-09,85412934,Ghanem,"everything was great, no problem at all"
8446,1182616,468328170,2019-06-12,176488842,Jing,"房屋位置挺不错,距离市政厅步行只需十来分钟,距离地铁站只需两分钟,公交车站也很近｡
Peter挺好,预先会把如何到达住处,如何拿钥匙之类细节问题提前告知,有问题询问他,他也快速响应｡
住宿地有电梯,方便行李拿取,套房内有三个房间,我住的还带有一个小阳台,只是房间不太隔音,住的其他客人发出的声音或多或少会影响到我｡
但总体来说是不错的地方,值得向大家推荐~"
8447,1182616,470357478,2019-06-16,119849789,Luke,"The location is great, but it's worth noting that the place is run like more of an Airbnb hotel with three rooms total sharing a kitchen and bathroom. If you need a simple place to stay this works well"
8448,1182616,472305081,2019-06-19,5648801,One,"Peter's place is really convenient.

However, when we arrived we realised that the sheets were not changed because there were still crumbs on the bed. We had to dust it off ourselves.

We also had to share the toilet and kitchen with 4 other persons; so you can imagine the long wait to wash up in the mornings. 

Finally, on the day that we were checking out, we were told that the time to check out is 12pm. But at 9am, a new group of people opened our room door and asked if we were leaving."
8449,1182616,473861318,2019-06-22,174111433,Pascal,Die Unterkunft ist toll gelegen. Zentral und alles fußläufig zu erreichen. Mehrere Einkaufsläden im Umkreis der Wohnung kann man für den Einkauf auswählen. Es können drei Zimmer gemietet werden. Bad und Küche wird mit den anderen Bewohnern geteilt. Die Sauberkeit und Betten waren in Ordnung. Peter hat zügig auf Fragen geantwortet. Wir hatten einen tollen Aufenthalt in Stockholm.
8450,1182616,478931302,2019-06-30,21632500,Shauna,"Peter's place is located in a great location, i never took transit and was able to walk everywhere. It was very close to several super markets and coffee shops.

This place is basically an air bnb hostel, with it being shared with several other guests. We were out long hours everyday, so it wasn't the biggest deal, but it did cause some troubles with only onee bathroom for several people and was quite loud at night.

That being said, Peter responds very quickly through the app."
8451,1182616,486187477,2019-07-12,272254020,Marion,"You pretty much get what you pay for. The room itself is quite nice, big and clean. The bathroom was smelly at times and it can get a bit crowded if seven or eight people want to use it in the morning. The kitchen was okay, also a bit dirty so not that great for cooking, but in the fridge was some fruit that seemed to have been in there for quite a while. All in all it wasn't terrible and if it was a bit cleaner I would recommend staying there because the location is great."
8452,1182616,487790421,2019-07-14,33521089,Marie,"Great for a quick stay in Stockholm. Flat is centrally located, short distance to public transport and shops/restaurants/etc. all around. Though we never met in person, the communication with Peter was very easy and friendly."
8453,1182616,490158721,2019-07-18,268827316,Dmytro (Short Form: Dima),Good room in a good place that not far from the Old Town. Simple place if you came to see Stockholm.
8454,1182616,498175537,2019-07-29,175990211,Samuele,"Very clear and good apartment in a fantastic position! 
10 minutes geom the bus station and in 15 minutes you are in The city center!
Peter is a Gret host!"
8455,1182616,499818876,2019-08-01,124650014,Jennifer,Sharing with 5 others made it a  little noisy at night.
8456,1182616,502850355,2019-08-05,160976553,Nina,"If you are looking for a place with easy check-in and great location, I totally recommend. A small downside is that there can be guests in other rooms too and the one toilet is shared so it was busy often."
8457,1182616,505273090,2019-08-09,37275049,Arturas,"Nice location, pleasant place to stay"
8458,1182616,508727643,2019-08-13,239368143,Claudia,"Everything just fine, very easy communication, neat room and close to the City!"
8459,1182616,512437478,2019-08-18,29099252,Coralie,"Appartement pratique et bien équipé. 
Très bien placé dans Stockholm, on a beaucoup aimé. En plus on avait un petit balcon privatif où on prenait notre petit déjeuner, très agreable !
L'appartement a 3 chambres et les 3 étaient louées pendant notre sejour. Nous n'avons pas croisé Peter mais il nous avait mis les clefs à dispo. Très pratique."
8460,1182616,517021162,2019-08-25,167715972,Ting,"The host, Peter, replies to the questions immediately if needed. The location is excellent. Many supermarkets around and it’s easy to get the river with great night view and also the city center by walk. The apartment is well organized. We feel pretty comfortable for the time there! Definitely recommend!"
8461,1182616,523224729,2019-09-03,192519625,Denys,"The flat is nice and minimalistic. It's located near the metro station, stores, and restaurants. It's about 30 minutes walking to the historic city center — Gamla Stan.

Please, keep in mind that you're going to live with travelers from 2 additional rooms. This means a queue to take a shower or make breakfast or dinner. We used to wait for about an hour while other people were taking a shower. However, you have complete privacy in your room.

The balcony is cozy, but not very suited for breakfasts — it's just a bonus.

A huge plus is that you can check-in and check-out on your own."
8462,1182616,524998271,2019-09-07,247295981,Diane,"Great location, very quiet .  Our room was on the back side of the apartment which was very quiet.  The balcony was nice to have.  The bed was extremely comfortable.  Very easy transportation to the airport which runs 24 hours . Bus stop is just a short 5 minute walk from the apartment."
8463,1182616,527087852,2019-09-10,60792329,Katarina,"Peter is very good host, available for all your questions. The apartman is in a very good location and is good for a short stay."

8465,1184553,78500743,2016-06-07,46491791,Ines,"Hi! I can just say that our stay at Annbrit´s place was perfect. The room is very nice and large and you have plenty of space for your things. The rest of the apartment was also beautiful, clean and the location was more than perfect. Just on one corner of Medborgarplatsen, one of the hot spots of the city, full of bars and shops, with a metro station in 2 minutes walking.
Annbritt is easy to communicate with and she was very kind and offered us help to go around the city or whatever other thing we could need during our stay.
I would massively recommend this place if you are planning to visit Stockholm for some days!"
8466,1184553,80668109,2016-06-19,7450837,Geneva,"My stay at Annbritt's place was lovely. The house is very nice and the location is fantastic, I think the neighborhood was one of my favorite in Stockholm."
8467,1184553,83044013,2016-07-01,8634024,Patrick,Nice clean bedroom in a great location! 
8468,1184553,84223345,2016-07-06,27202179,Gamze,"Annbritt was one of the best 'friendly host' i have met so far. The room was exactly same as seen in the photos. House was very clean, tidy, comfortable and its location was great! We did not use any public transport during our holiday.
Her flexibility at check in/out times was very helpful for us as we had to put our luggages to her home while we were waiting our train."
8469,1184553,85815919,2016-07-13,2510148,Laura,"Annbritt was an excellent host. We have been able to check in earlier than expected, she was lovely and very flexible. Also great communication before and during our stay to make our stay comfortable !
The apartment was perfect for two. It is very spacious, full of light and the room is great. The bed is comfy, there is a table to dine in the room, and even a TV and the view is amazing!
The apartment is located in Soderlalm just 20 min walk from GamlaStan the old town. The neighborhood is so cute, with little shops coffee and restaurants and only 20 min walk from the see to have a walk. 
Thanks for this amazing stay in Stockholm ! I highly recommend this place 
"
8470,1184553,87336938,2016-07-19,33385471,Camilla,"We had a nice stay at anbritts location! Near to the old town (3minutes walk) and only 2 Metro stations from the famous Vasa Museum. 
Anbritt was really friendly! 
One thing you have to notice that it is really loud at Weekend Nights cause there are a few bars directly under the window. So sleeping with an open window was hard.
To sum up it was a really nice stay but we thougt it was a little bit overprized cause you only have one room and a bathroom and are not allowed to use the kitchen or the balcony."
8471,1184553,89771036,2016-07-30,32558680,Paul,"The host provided great directions to the location and was very helpful leading up to our stay. When we arrived, Annbritt helped us get situated and figure out the local bus routes. The location is absolutely perfect: right across the street from a metro stop (3 stops away from the central station) and situated in a charming square with plenty of restaurants, grocery stores, and great cafes. 

We really enjoyed our time in Stockholm and would recommend this place to anyone visiting the city."
8472,1184553,95867856,2016-08-21,2079015,Guilhem,"The room is nice, clean and comfy, and the flat has a really good location in Sodermalm right next to a metro station. Annbritt has been easy to communicate with, and helpful letting us leave our luggage before and after the checking and leaving time."
8473,1184553,159902479,2017-06-12,5819741,Brett,"As described large room which is amazing after visiting other cities with smaller rooms.
Excellent communication and perfect location, highly recommended!

No kitchen use or laundry as per description."
8474,1184553,161479806,2017-06-18,46026527,Dash,Annbritt's listing in Stockholm was great. Room is accurately described and in a great location that is convenient for walks to Gamla Stan and is located in a very trendy area. Would stay again. 
8475,1184553,163081910,2017-06-23,3237341,Victor Hugo,"I had a wonderful stay, and Annbritt was very helpful as host.

Highly recommend this room!:)"
8476,1184553,166256197,2017-07-03,120196007,Kate,"Apartment was exactly as described, clean and bright. Easy to find,  lots of bars and restaurants within walking distance and public transport links are excellent.

Communication with Annbritt in advance was clear. We didn't see Annbritt after check in but she was available by phone if we needed.

As stated in description, there  no access to kitchen (I missed a  kettle) or living room."
8477,1184553,169572985,2017-07-13,3962150,Elodie,"L'appartement d'Annbritt est vraiment central, depuis ce dernier vous pourrez vous déplacer à pieds, en vélo, en bus, etc. La chambre est exactement comme indiquée dans l'annonce, vous ne pouvez vous y sentir que bien. Enfin, Annbritt est une personne agréable et vraiment arrangeante, nous vous recommandons donc son logement."

8479,1184553,173825871,2017-07-24,24897566,Caroline,Appartement proche de tout et pratique. On peut faire de petites courses à proximité pour manger sur le pouce.
8480,1184553,176902023,2017-08-01,114269404,Lauren,"We had a comfortable stay at Annbritt's place. The location is great, walkable into the city. I would probably recommend hiring the city bikes that can be done for 3 days and the passes can be purchased from 7/11 to get around the city. Although our stay was great, keep in mind when looking for a place that the city is very expensive for meals so it would've been handy to have kitchen access that we did not have here."
8481,1184553,182161189,2017-08-14,120763074,Marco,"Posizione ideale, camera grande e letto comodo.

8485,1184553,278939169,2018-06-19,29170540,Matthias,"Annbritts place is really great to explore the awesome city of Stockholm! It’s close to everything you need. Cafes, Bars, Restaurants, Shopping and Public Transportation are just a stone throw away. A sightseeing bus stop and Metro station are just a 3 minute walk away. The room was very clean and we really liked the furniture and the overall style of the apartment. Communicating with Annbritt was very easy and fast. During our stay she checked-in on us and asked if everything was okay and really made us feel at home! :-) Thanks again!"
8486,1184553,282834478,2018-06-28,61443517,Andrew,"Annbritt's place was an awesome place to stay while we were in Stockholm. It was extremely close tonic transportation but my girlfriend and I decided to walk to Gamla Stan every day. It was about a 10 minute walk and was extremely simple and pretty. 

The apartment was extremely clean and the tea kettle and water pitcher were a great addition."
8487,1184553,285184649,2018-07-03,177644175,Eve,"Very responsive host and place is clean.  Accurate amenities; bathroom, wifi, small tv, and a kettle. The window is not designed to be widely opened, so it was a little hot at times. Overall the stay is good. Near to metro and lots of food nearby."
8488,1184553,287557027,2018-07-08,11526375,Lesther,"Muchas gracias Annbritt por la estancia en tu apartamento, fue mucho mejor de lo que esperabamos, excelente ubicación y ambiente "
8489,1184553,289825216,2018-07-13,29220266,Lior,"Her place was great (minus no A/C or fan) and in an amazing location, but Annbritt herself was slightly disappointing. From the moment we arrived, she was pretty short with us and borderline rude (even about simple questions). Instructions were given and things marked around the house as if a toddler were to stay there, and we never felt truly welcome. 

Her place is nice and accurate as advertised and still in an amazing location.

We only saw Annbritt when we arrived but she was always available by phone in case we had question or problem. She also gave us some addresses to eat. 
The room and bathroom were really clean, the bed was really comfy and we had a great view! The location is perfect, not far from the old town on foot. 
We sincerely recommend :)"

8497,1184553,470627163,2019-06-16,117172305,John,"We had a lovely stay in Stockholm and Annbritt's place was in a perfect location - right in the centre of Södermalm and really good transport links (the closest metro stop was Medborgarplatsen and we could get everywhere we wanted from here). The room was tidy and spacious with nice homely touches, it was sunny and hot when we visited so the fan was very welcome. Check-in and out was easy, Annbritt wasn't around for most of our stay but kept in touch and was very friendly; she was welcoming but also left us to get on with our trip which was a good balance."
8498,1184553,486739767,2019-07-13,91837015,Katja,"Perfectly placed in a very nice area with lots of possibilities to eat and shop, transportation nearby.

Très bel appartement très central dans le quartier ultra branché de Södermalm.
Tout était très propre. Annbritt nous a conseillé plusieurs adresses et activités à faire.
Merci encore pour ce séjour !"
8502,1184553,505273010,2019-08-09,54970619,Claudia,"Annbritt è stata molto gentile e disponibile, sempre pronta a rispondere a dubbi e domande durante la permanenza. Il suo appartamento è bellissimo, pulito, in una zona molto vicina al centro città, con la metro e i negozi a pochi passi e un sacco di locali carini. Ho letto dei commenti sulla confusione in tarda serata, ma non sono d'accordo. Il quartiere è tranquillo e anche se nei weekend è più affollato di sera, non ho avuto alcun fastidio. Inoltre, le finestre dell'appartamento sono spesse e perciò non arrivano rumori dall'esterno se sono chiuse.
L'appartamento di Annbritt è ideale se si vuole essere vicini al centro per esplorare la città ma anche vicini ai locali per uscire di sera o andare per negozi."

8505,1184553,519374382,2019-08-28,44412104,Natalia,"Everything as expected - clean place with great location and the host responding fast. We appreciate Annbritt let us check in much later (because of rescheduled flight) and we could leave our luggage there until the afternoon and pick it up just before leaving to the airport. What I didnt like was the bed - too soft so I could barely sleep. But that is just a matter of one ´s preference. I ´ve had much warmer hosts in the past, but that is a matter of personal preference, too."

I have no complaints and I highly recommend this apartment anyway.
8507,1189469,6280379,2013-08-06,4523751,Nixon,"We stayed there for 5 days. It is a very beautiful Apartment and very clean. When we arrived, it was newly renovated. Jorgen was very kind and helpful during the stay.

Directly in front of the Apartment you have a park to go for a walk and relax. Just 3 minutes away is the central place of the city with restaurants, bars and clubs. But when you're not in the mood to go out, the Apartment is perfect to hang out. Cook diner first in the modern kitchen and after that watch a movie on the big tv in the living room with a cool sound system. For those who like good entertainment, you will be in the right place. It's so comfortable, that my friends just wanted to take a nap in the afternoon, sleeped for few hours.

Stockholm was a very nice experience for us, with a really cool and modern Apartment to stay. I recommend it to anyone who will stay in Stockolm for few days.

Thanks to Jorgen and Isabelle"

The hosts allowed us to check in early (10am) since our red eye flight from the USA got in very early in the morning. The location was right across the street from a beautiful park and within easy walking distance (15 min) to the harbor and Gamla Stan.  We walked everywhere. No need for a car. There were several nice grocery stores right on their street and many nice places to eat. They had a washer and dryer that we could use as well.

Everything is as described, access was a breeze, and the location is excellent -  very close to bus/subway, several grocery stores, and walking distance to downtown.

It is in a perfect location in a wonderful neighborhood with restaurants, breakfast places, shops etc. close by.  Alida has great taste and we immediately felt home.  She left us a great bottle of Italian red wine, which we enjoyed a lot.  There is a master bedroom with a big double bed and a french size bed in the daughter's bedroom, which is a little small for 2 people, but manageable.  The check-in/check-out was super easy and Alida replied super quickly to our questions.  This place is not an ""only"" Airbnb place, but the family lives there and therefore you see a lot of personal items, food in the fridge and toys in the girl's room.  For us it was not a problem at all, but I just wanted to mention that.  We would definitely come back to beautiful Stockholm and would for sure book Alida's place again."

When I called, Nettan was kind and gave me detailed advice on how to get there in the most cost-effective way. The flat was very clean, warm and welcoming, and I had all the comforts and amenities I could ask for. 
Thank you so much Nettan, I will definitely come again if I need a place to stay in Stockholm in the future, and will gladly recommend the room to anyone who seeks my advice on where to stay. "

I was a little nervous because this was my first time using Airbnb, but she made me feel right at home.  The apartment is clean and neat, and the furnishings are very warm and inviting.  The kitchen and bedroom have a great view of the bay and the cruise terminal – it doesn’t get any better than breakfast with a view!  I didn’t use the kitchen much, but it seems very well-equipped and modern, and it has a great coffee maker.  The bathroom has sufficient counter space, and the shower has great water pressure.  Wifi was speedy.  The apartment is located in a quiet residential area, and it is within walking distance of the bus and t-bana (underground).  I would definitely recommend this room, and I would love to stay here again if I come back someday!"

So I would definitely be very happy if I could stay at Nettan's place again the next time I visit Stockholm."
8554,1204621,18719842,2014-08-31,17495138,Anne,"I stayed with Nettan for almost a month while I was looking for a more permanent place to live in Stockholm. It was a great way to begin my time in the city. The apartment is really nice and so is Nettan. She was always helpful and friendly and I felt I could use the apartment on equal terms with her, which was nice especially during the evenings. The apartment is really nicely located close to Gärdet, which is a big park, and not far from the city center. I can only recommend staying with Nettan if you are visiting Stockholm."
8555,1204621,20295060,2014-09-27,20681217,Saara,"I stayed in this room approximately 2 weeks when attending a course in KTH and liked it very much. The room as well as the whole apartment are beautiful and well-appointed with a good kitchen and a nice view to the ferry harbour. The location is excellent as the Gärdet metrostation is near, in the neighbouring area there are also grocery shops and lots of parks and other green areas. The host was welcoming, nice and friendly and always ready to help. "
8556,1204621,23596568,2014-12-06,17087916,Becca,"Nettan was a perfect host. Everything about her apartment and location and amenities were as she described, clean and quiet. It is a short bus or train ride to the city center. Nettan was always quick to respond to queries via email or in person once we were there, and made us feel very welcome."
8557,1204621,29125793,2015-04-04,25798486,Sinda,"As with previous reviews, staying with Nettan was great. She is very considerate and welcoming. The Room is spacious and light with lovely view of ferry harbour. Kitchen is well equipped and breakfast table has same nice view. The building is conveniently located 200 metres from a supermarket, 5 minutes from a bus station into town centre (number 1) and also about 7 minutes from the underground trains (Gardet). It is a little outside the centre (but near enough to centre) which is nice if you wish to feel you're outdoors/nature, run or walk in nearby Djurgarden or stroll past the various beautiful embassy mansion villas along the canal walkway to Strandvagen.

The room has a big window with a wonderful view over the harbour and the cruise ships. 
The kitchen and the bathroom are very modern and have everything you need. 
The house is located close to the bus station and the tunnelbana, shops and restaurants are also nearby.  
But you also have a great park and nature around the corner. 

Nettan is a very friendly and helpful person. You feel welcome from the first moment you arrive. 

I would stay with her again and can warmly recommend to stay at her apartment.

I was not able to be at  some nice places without her advices because my guide books did not tell me! My room was very nice and comfortable. Her house was pretty close to the train station by walk and from station to the city central was easy to access. I am so glad to stay at her house. I miss Stockholm. One of the best city where I have been. Thank you so much Nettan.

Her apartment is very clean and bright, and we enjoyed staying there--especially since it is just down the block from our grandchildren, which was the reason for our visit! Access to bus lines and trains is easy."
8570,1204621,68179788,2016-04-02,17087916,Becca,"Nettan welcomed us back, as we stayed with her for a couple of days, then went to the countryside for a few days, returning to Stockholm - and her apartment - to finish out our trip. I commented earlier about how welcoming and organized she is, and that continues to be true."

8572,1204621,71918797,2016-04-29,22890416,Johan,Nettan is an excellent host and she's hosting a nice place in quiet Gärdet in Stockholm. There's a ICA convenience store 5 min away and a really big ICA 10 min away. It's a short walk to the subway or the # 1 bus and you'll be in the center really fast. The bathroom is very nice with capabilities to do laundry. Everything is nice clean tidy and modern. I enjoyed our conversations very much and I would highly recommend this place if you don't need to live right smack in the middle of Stockholm!

This place have everything that you can ask for... cozy bed, convenient kitchen, clean bathroom and they are come with fabulous view of the river that you can see it every time you wake up. Pretty nice neighbourhood, a little bit of quiet not like in the city centre.

And Nettan is very nice and sincere host. We have a good talk and she tells me a lot of things about Sweden, quite fascinating! She also suggest me about where to go and hangout like local that you not gonna see it in typical guide book.

Overall, this is a great place to stay and you will not gonna regret it! I promise :)"
8576,1204621,75325219,2016-05-20,68535862,Linda,"I spend 5 nights at Nettan's place while traveling in Stockholm.   Nettan is an awesome host.  She is very friendly, warm and interesting to talk to.  Her flat is very clean.  Her flat is very easily accessible from the train station and the town center with the super efficient and frequent subway.  Her place is about 7 minutes away from the subway station.  Just follow Nettan's clear and easy to follow directions.  For those who enjoy walking, Nettan's flat is about 30-40 minutes of pleasant stroll to the Vasa museum.  You will pass the Swedish Film Institute and the TV station along the way.  The room is actually much better than the picture.  The room is really big and bright.  There is a big window that over looks the harbor.  Everyday, you will see the ferry coming in from Finland in the morning, and leave in the evening.  I love watching the boats going by.  The bed is very comfortable.  I slept like a baby everyday.  Her shower is very luxurious.  It has the rain shower.  It is perfect for washing away the exhaustion of traveling.  There are 2 supermarkets that are few minutes away.  I definitely recommend Nettan's place."

Nettan is a wonderful host, offer me all the help I needed and allow me to use her kitchen. The house is really clean and cozy, with also a great view. The location is also great, only about 5 minute walk to the metro station, 8 minutes ride to the city centre. It is also really close to the harbour of Tallink Silja line, so I don't have to carry my luggage all across the city. 
So if you are finding an apartment located in a quiet neighbourhood but still near to the city centre and the pier, Nettan's place is the perfect one."

My luggage arrival was delayed and she assisted my communication with the airport. Secondly, the flat itself is super clean and comfortable, and its location is 7 min away from the Gardet metro station. Also. The room feels bigger than how it looks in the pictures. Nettan let me use the kitchen freely and gave me a whole drawer and a shelf in the fridge. Thirdly, she was extremely helpful with tips and directions. I would definitely recommend you to take her place and would be very happy to visit there myself again! "

Nettan's appartment has a good location, close to subway and city centre. It's very confortable and it has everything you may need.

Pidin asunnosta ja sen sijainnista meren ja ulkoilualueiden lähellä. Alue oli rauhallista ja liikenneyhteydet keskustaan olivat erinomaiset. Sain aina apua kun tarvitsin neuvoa Tukholmassa liikkumiseen tai ideoita kivoista vierailukohteista.

8705,1205051,16907786,2014-08-04,16985025,Bruno,"Viktor was really welcoming and was even able to host me a few hours before schedule. He had everything you need to cook, and he's happy to share it. His flat is amazing, bright, REALLY CLEAN, conmfy and stuff. If it wasn't so big, I would have stolen this bed. It's the best I've ever sleept in! I was a bit reluctant about the price at first, but when I was in there, I knew that it was really cheap compared to Stockholm standard. 
Go for it!"

The furniture is very nice, specially the cosy bed. I also liked the location, you are quick in the old town and also at the central station (just two/three stations with the subway). Bus stations are also in the near of the apartment. And many other things like supermarkets, bars, restaurants, shops, pharmacy..

Viktor is a very good host - he answers quickly and everything is totally uncomplicated. "

If there´s a downside it´s that bathroom is not new (although it´s clean) and there could be more cooking appliances available (although I got by perfectly with what was available), however that didn´t bother me too much. The bed was comfy, it was quiet at night, plenty of hot water, and fast internet access. Highly recommended."
8714,1205051,24559055,2014-12-30,19524220,Eric,"Viktor offers a fantastic flat, it contains everything you will need, and some entertainments when you stay inside the flat.

The apartment itself is a real gem: take a close look to the gorgeous living room: in real, it is even more impressive! No doubt  to have here: Viktor got quite a eye and taste when it's time to create an ambiance and for home decoration. And very important, it was super clean! Don't worry about communication: super fast answer, often within minutes.

And Stockholm: what a city to enjoy and discover. We will certainly come back sooner then later and i'll contact Viktor for his place for sure

Many thanks"

El apartamento perfecto de tamaño, con todo lo que necesitabamos y una decoración muy cuidada. El barrio no es el centro turístico sino más el barrio joven y cool de la ciudad, que es lo que buscábamos. Súper bien conectado con transporte público (bus y metro). "
8725,1205051,34985923,2015-06-14,2745270,Kevin,Viktor was very friendly and was quick to respond to all queries. His place is clean and just the right size for 2 people. It is very central to everything. Would recommend for anyone else!

Viktor was a kind and considerate host. When coffee cartridges ran out for the Nespresso machine, he sent some around. And when they needed to drop off a piece of furniture during our stay, he sent a bottle of champagne for our troubles (though it was no trouble at all).

The neighbourhood is also outstanding. Lots of shops and bars and cafes, and it's a world away from the touristy areas of the city. If you prefer to get a sense of what it's like to live in a place, this is the apartment for you. Be sure to check out Pet Sounds too, the coolest record shop in Stockholm.

We were sad to leave."

The communication with Viktor prior to check in and during the stay was smooth sailing. I definitely recommend this place!"

8745,1212891,6268168,2013-08-05,7905481,Peter,Maud made my stay very pleasant and nice. Both arriving and leaving (early) was arranged smoothly. Maud offered both something to eat and conversation (if you like) she made it clear that you can also just have your privacy if wanted. The location was perfect for taking the ferry in the morning to Finland. Plenty of parking space on the street. 
8746,1212891,6316761,2013-08-07,1104165,Daniel,"I stayed in Maud's apartment for two nights. She responded quickly and was friendly and helpful. The room and bed were nice and tidy and Maud provided clean towels for showering and in case I wanted to go swimming. She didn't want to give me a key to the house since I was unreviewed on Airbnb (I'm not sure why?!), so instead we just agreed on a time frame during which I would arrive, so that wasn't a problem. She also gave me a (rather large) discount to make up for the inconvenience. The area is beautiful with lots of parks and a long amazing waterfront boardwalk with an assortment of bars and restaurants, and I ended up just strolling around for hours. It's perfect walking distance from the city centre if you're not in a hurry. Recommended!"
8747,1212891,6536996,2013-08-16,682178,Luca,"We stayed at Maud's house for few hours, but was nice and comfortable. She has a great experience in hosting people so you'll find yourself well with her and her cars. The position is easy to the metro, very quite and easy to reach. "

8749,1212891,6820242,2013-08-26,7809472,Guillaume,"That was my first experience as a air bnb as i booked hotel but i wanted a change. The house is nice, cosy and very clean. Maud is a good host and she let me borrowed her bike. The ride to reach the city centre is very nice and takes 20 minutes maximum by the river. It was my highlight. The aera is nice and shops, restaurant  are very close by like 5mn walk maximum. I would recommend the place if you need a quiet place and not far from the city. She's cool;)

Maud was very easy to communicate with and also very helpful She even agreed to pay my money back on her own suggestion without beeing obligated to, which was incredebly nice of her! I can strongly recommend Maud as a host. She is a nice and considering, helpful and very realiable person!

Maud and her two cats were a warm hosts, and she explained to us all about the main sights of Stockholm.
We used the kitchen every evening for dinner. It has all you need to prepare a meal. She also kept a shelf in her fridge for us to put our stuff.

Sad to say, but we were indisposed and could not use Maud's accommodation this time. But we will definitely visit Maud ahead. Communication with Maud has worked very well and we look forward to meeting her personally."
8773,1212891,13600963,2014-06-01,10018635,Jean-Baptiste,"We greatly recommend Maud. From the minute we stepped in her apartment, she made us feel at home and provided us with a lot of useful information. During our stay, Maud was always smiling, helpful, warm and easy to talk to ! We were totally satisfied with the room, which was really quiet and comfortable. Moreover, its location is great. You can either reach Stockholm by metro (the nearest stop is just a few meters away from the room) or by walk (it takes no more than 20/30min). Thanks to Maud and to all the effort she put into making us feel at home, we had a wonderful stay. We are looking forward to going back to Stockholm soon. 
If you love cats, do not hesitate !! Maud has two beautiful and lovely cats."
8774,1212891,13696290,2014-06-02,14733676,Michael,"Maud is a wonderful host and her cats are very friendly!  The room is comfortable and the location is very convenient (a short walk to the light rail system).  We had but a short time to visit with Maud before we went sightseeing, but she was very helpful with suggestions and we had an enjoyable conversation about traveling.  We had to leave early the next morning, so didn't get to say ""thank you"" to Maud.  We want to heartily recommend Maud's listing to any travelers to Stockholm. "
8775,1212891,13786281,2014-06-04,14072942,Yan Ting Rachel,"Maud's place was very accessible by metro. When we arrived, we had no trouble locating her apartment as she had a post-it stuck on her door addressing us. We felt welcomed even before entering her house. Maud was always all smiles during our stay and would always greet us. She is very open to chatting about her life or about the different origins of her guests. It was a pity that we could not stay longer to get to know her better. The apartment was very tidy and cosy and the cats played good hosts too; very affectionate and absolutely adorable. We would definitely consider a stay with Maud again should we visit stockholm in future."
8776,1212891,13856393,2014-06-06,15543065,Donna,"Maud was very nice and accommodating during our stay in Stockholm.  She told us how to save money on groceries (which was important for us).  Maud is very friendly, as are her two cats.  Her apartment has good access to the metro, and it was pretty convenient from that respect. She was also kind enough to let us leave our luggage there after we had ""checked out"" so that we could continue to explore the city until we needed to board the train for the next leg in our journey."
8777,1212891,13872941,2014-06-07,9481658,John,"I  stayed at Maud's  place for only a single night, but now wished that I could have stayed longer. She is a truly beautiful person, who made me, as a guest, feel very welcome. She showed me around Skansen the following day, which was just terrific. I hope to come back one day."

Very nice location and neighbourhood.  Maud was a lovely host, friendly, welcoming and thoughtful (she even gave me some herbal tea and honey when I was ill) and helpful with information for our visit to Stockholm  We also loved her sweet and friendly cats.  We would definitely consider staying with her again when we visit Stockholm in the future.  "

Maud was really helpful in providing information about Stockholm and things to do and also dug out an iron for me to sort out a creased shirt and bridesmaid dress dilemma! I would definitely recommend staying here and the gorgeous cats are a bonus :) "
8782,1212891,14396440,2014-06-18,12023125,Peilang,It is really a wonderful stay in Muad's house. She is so nice that always think of your convenience and try to give you a comfortable stay. And the two lovely cats are so adorable that you will love them!!

8785,1212891,15087957,2014-07-02,12674768,Kathleen,"Maud met us at the train station (our flight was delayed and it was quite late). We walked together to her apt and by the time we arrived (5 minutes later) I knew we were in the right place. Maud is warm and welcoming and has a lovely apt set up for guests. Everything is labeled, available and helpful. We had tour info, tea and coffee and even some pain medicine for my sore foot. When we return to Stockholm we will certainly stay with Maud. Her place is convenient to train but quiet and clean and her kitties are adorable."
8786,1212891,15269776,2014-07-06,16094449,Omri,"Maud was nice and generous, already while planning my trip she gave me a lot of information and helped me find what I was seeking.
She welcomed me with open hands a big smile, and as I got sick she did all her best to make me feel better, with medicines etc.
Very lovely person for conversation!
Made me feel at home in her lovely flat.
I will definitely come back :)"
8787,1212891,15401750,2014-07-08,15313752,Jim,"Maude made us most welcome at her apartment – very open and helpful.  She has an amazing folder of useful information, and gave us assistance with everything from shopping to onward travel.

She shared her apartment very easily, and it was well located for access to the city and local waterfront.  Cosy but very comfortable.

I really recommand this place"
8792,1212891,17096063,2014-08-07,15956213,Raphael,"Maud is a very kind and openminded person who helps you generously. the apartment is located about 5 minutes from the next metro station, so it's easy to reach all places in the city. the room was clean and cosy, but for two people a bit small. nevertheless we can recommend staying at maud's place! "
8793,1212891,17141657,2014-08-08,12932741,Diego,"We felt really good in the house. The atmosphere was great and we used the services as if we were at our home. Maud was also very friendly and helpful in every request and giving information about Stockholm. 
The house was close to supermarket and public services and was in a quiet and safe area. "

8795,1212891,17826394,2014-08-18,15931684,Leszek,"Maud is a very friendly and helpful person. The place is well-located, well-connected (just a few minutes' walk from the Kristineberg T-bana station and several bus stops) and there's a pleasant waterfront and a rocky beach nearby, so I'd suggest packing a swimsuit. :) The flat is clean and well-equipped, we had absolutely everything we needed, the cats were not a bother at all. Thanks for having us, Maud!"
8796,1212891,17951341,2014-08-19,3399075,Moysh,"We only stayed with Maud one night, but it was everything we needed. Maud is a very warm, friendly and welcoming host, which makes it a pleasure to be her guest."

We could use everything in the apartment's kitchen and bathroom. The surrounding area is not central Stockholm, but it's easy to get there by train. So, everything was fine and I would highly recommend a stay at Maud's place."
8798,1212891,18941319,2014-09-03,17105480,Nuria,"A finales de agosto mi pareja y yo vuimos a Estocolmo de vacaciones durante 5 días. El piso es planta baja/primer piso y está a menos de 5 minutos del metro, a pocas paradas del centro. La zona es residencial con parques y un supermercado enorme cerca. La decoración del piso es de lo más romántica pero todo super utilitario. Si no os gustan los gatos no importa, los dos de Maud son muy educados, duermen todo el rato y no molestan para nada. Este es también el ambiente del piso: silencio y tranquilidad a cualquier hora, y no se oye nada de ruido de los vecinos, es casi como vivir aislado de la ciudad, me encantó! Maud nos recibió muy bien y nos contó todo lo necesario. Para no tener que ir preguntado todo el rato tiene una hoja con información del piso en la habitación, donde también está el wifi apuntado. Con respecto a internet no pude estar más contenta! Durante mi estancia tuve que trabajar con mi portátil durante 3 días y pude comprobar que la conexión es perfecta.

Cuando nos fuimos nos preguntó si creíamos que se podía cambiar algo del piso para mejorarlo y hacer la estancia de los huéspedes más agradable (por cierto, son solo 2 habitaciones de huéspedes, no os penseis que eso es un hotel concurrido ni nada por el estilo) y la verdad es que creo que no es posible mejorarlo más! A mi parecer, el sitio perfecto para vivir, trabajar y descansar después del turismo. "
8799,1212891,19071230,2014-09-06,15063450,Lila,"Maud is a lovely, friendly and easy-going person! It's very easy to deal with her, she is always ready to help and she makes you feel free all the time. It was very nice to meet her and  chat with her. The apartment is near to the metro, supermarket and the sea! It's a nice neighborhood. Everything is clean, the shower is nice and the cats are lovely. We enjoyed a lot! Thank you for everything, Maud!"
8800,1212891,19204333,2014-09-08,10923886,Julie,"My fiancé and I deeply enjoyed our stay at Maud's home. The place was very easy to get to from the central station, and is located in a beautiful area. There is a huge market nearby, making it easy and delightful to have frequent picnics by the waterfront. The walk from her place to the city center along the waters is really nice as well. As for the actual room, it was spotlessly clean! I was very impressed and believe that it is even nicer than in the pictures. Her place was very well organized and cozy! Also, Maud was super sweet and welcoming. We would recommend anyone to visit stockholm (loved it) and stay here!"
8801,1212891,24051823,2014-12-18,23533313,Josep Ramon,Nice room and Maud helped us with all the info with the city and the flat. Warm welcome and really good place and near the city center.
8802,1212891,24408024,2014-12-28,5940712,Antonio,"Il nostro soggiorno è stato perfetto. La zona è tranquilla e residenziale ma a soli 15 minuti dal centro. La casa è silenziosa, piccina ma ben organizzata per ricevere ospiti. Ci sono due gatti che gironzolano per la casa ma sono assolutamente una piacevole compagnia. In generale la casa è pulita e la cucina è a disposizione. Maud è stata il valore aggiunto perché fin da prima del nostro viaggio è stata sempre disponibile nel darci informazioni utili su tutto, ma sopratutto ci ha fatto sentire come se fossimo a casa nostra, sempre.  In generale torneremmo volentieri e mi sento di consigliare la sistemazione, per la gentilezza del proprietario e per l'incredibile comodità e vicinanza ai mezzi."

The indications to reach your location are clear and travelling by bus is a nice way also to discover the landscape ! We arrived during snow time and your appartment has a nice view . All is made to facilited our stay on an easy going way but all is planned in kitchen and bathroom.
A perfect place to be part of swedish life.

8813,1212891,26098152,2015-02-03,24345984,Arthur,"Maud is very helpful and friendly host. She welcomed us at her place on the day of check in. Explain about apartment and helped us navigate in the city. Apartment as describe, very clean and plenty of room. Location is excellent, only few minutes walk from the metro, and using metro you can get everywhere in the Stockholm. Only 10 minutes ride to the city center if not less. There is 3 different metro's you can take to get to city center.Apartment located near few supermarkets. One is 3 minutes by the metro station, and there is a bigger one around 4-5 minutes walk in opposite direction. Plenty of cafes and restaurants within walking distance. On the last day we seen a bunny running around outside, right by our window. Would reccommend Maud's apartment. Excellent Host!"

The room and everything else was so neat and tidy that one could almost feel at home. The bed was quite comfortable. As I was already familiar with Stockholm, I didn't need any help but I could see she was ready to help if I did. No trouble at all arranging the arrival, either. I have only positive things to say about my visit. Thanks, Maud!"

The flat was clean and cosy and my room was exact how she described it in her profile. Maud is also a very helpful person, so she let me know that I can ask her everything at any time. Since I was working the whole day during my stay, it is important to stress that I slept very well (calm house/area, comfortable bed). I can recommend this place. Thanks for everything and hope to see you again, Maud! Best wishes // anja"

Everything was provided in the flat, very helpful when you travel by plane with only a handbag. 
Thank you Maud for this nice trip. 
I recommend this host. "

We were exhausted in our trip since we visited Stockholm for 2 days only, arrived in the evening and left early! Overall, Maud is very accommodating and totally a good host. She has kept her place tidy and organized! She has clear instruction and house rules which were very friendly and easy to follow, of course in order to keep her place neat for the next guests. Maud also provide maps and some useful tips, I would recommend to install 'stay' app as it helps us navigate the city - good for tourist really! The walk from Maud's place from the metro station is at least 10 mins, if that helps. "
8823,1212891,27584865,2015-03-08,26448662,Plaban,The room is really cute with all facilities. Maud is friendly and helpful and has arranged her house in guest friendly way.

Maud ist eine sehr nette und herzliche Gastgeberin, die sich sehr über das Wohl ihrer Gäste bemüht. Außerdem ist sie stets hilfsbereit und man kann allgemein gute Gespräche führen.
Ich habe meinen Aufenthalt sehr genossen (auch wegen den wahnsinnig süßen Katzen ;)). 
"

Everything is thoughtfully organised and I appreciated the comfort which I could stay in, and I was also very grateful of the advice about the city I am moving to! The room was exactly as described and I slept very well. Sharing the use of the bathroom with Maud and the other guest was not a problem and both are very well equipped. Tack så mycket! "
8826,1212891,28556198,2015-03-26,8637047,Mihaela,"Maud is a great host, made us feel like home the whole time we spent in the ""Purple Room"". We had no problems in finding the apartment, the directions were more than accurate, and we where there in time to get to the supermarket and do some shopping for breakfast. 
The neighborhood is nice and quiet and we even saw rabbits in front of our window when we first arrived!!! :)
Maud's two cats are really adorable and spent some quality time with them in the morning, drinking our coffee. Kinda missed home those moments, but the feeling was great.

We would recommend Maud's room for everyone is looking for some nice cosy place that you can call home after an exhausting day in Stockholm. That place is so warm and welcoming and Maud has a real gift of making you fell welcomed and wanting to spend more time with her. 
Also you can walk for only a few minutes to the nearest Metro station and one really good and huge supermarket."

Description on listing was accurate, neighbourhood was calm, and thus I enjoyed my time in Sweden very much and would return if someday possible. "

The flat is not big but cosy and the room is nice for one person. You share the kichen and bathroom (all very tidy). Staying with Maud is relaxing and natural. She helps you where she can. The cats play an important role in your stay.
8829,1212891,30569511,2015-04-24,15283059,Ian,"Maud was very nice and welcoming. The room was very clean and you have access to the kitchen to make tea and coffee etc. The atmosphere was relaxed and just a short walk 4/5 minute to the metro. 
I came to Stockholm for an exam and this was the perfect place to stay for a night/nights. Thanks Maud."

The room has everything you need and Maud even thinks about small (but valuable!) things such as water,  pen and notebook, city guidebook and a map. Also, she holds a pile of brochures so you can definitely find new ideas on how to spend your time. 
The apartment is located not far from the metro line heading to the center and from the supermarket. And Maud gives perfect instruction on how to find it. 
Would definitely recommend to stay with Maud, especially if you are travelling on a budget. "

Sie hat mich vorab schon mit zahlreichen Informationen versorgt, auf das aktuelle Wetter hingewiesen und mir entsprechende Kleidung angeboten... Ich habe sie als stets freundlichen und hilfsbereiten Menschen kennengelernt, darüber hinaus hat sie aber auch eine tolle Persönlichkeit, immer gut gelaunt, ich habe zum ersten Mal einen grünen Smoothie probiert, etwas über Yoga gelernt... wer also Ansprache wünscht, bekommt diese auch, genauso kann man sich aber auch in sein Zimmer zurückziehen. Das Zimmer/die Wohnung sind genau wie beschrieben, alles gemütlich und sehr sauber und gepflegt! Ich konnte in der Küche alles mitbenutzen, Tee und Kochbasics sind vorhanden, zum Empfang hatte Maud gleich eine Tasse Kaffee für mich bereitet. Badzimmer wird geteilt nach Absprache, alles klappte total problemlos. Die Wohnung liegt sehr gut, nach ca. 300m ist man am Wasser, dort gibt es auch ein schönes Restaurant, man kann auch super schön am Wasser spazieren gehen. Ein großer Supermarkt und mehrere Restaurants / Bars sind im Radius von ca. 400m zu erreichen, in ungefähr gleicher Entfernung liegt die U-Bahn mit direkter Anbindung ins Zentrum ( 5 Haltestellen waren es glaube ich bis T-Centralen ). Ich würde jederzeit wieder bei Maud wohnen, ganz lieben Dank nochmal für die Gastfreundschaft!!! (Website hidden by Airbnb)"
8834,1212891,31881323,2015-05-11,1450646,Natalia,"Maud is a perfect host, she makes you feel very welcome, she's also very helpful and gives great advice about Stockholm. Her place is super easy to reach, it is located in a nice neighbourhood, with a homey pizza place and a nice view nearby. The room looks exactly - although much more cosy - as on the pictures. Maud's two cats are very polite and quiet. Overall, staying with Maud is really pleasant and we would love to come back next time we visit Stockholm!"
8835,1212891,32450836,2015-05-18,25856680,Lodewijk,"Hi all, my wife and i spent a fantastic 4 nights at Mauds in Stockholm. 
The site really says it all : it's a very nice place and Maud is a very nice lady !
We had the best of times, we felt really welcome, and felt very much at home from the first minute.
We're cat people, that helps of course, and i must say the cats are two real beauties, very sociable, and wander around freely, but are never a nuisance and are strictly kept out of the bedroom.
Maud is a a great source of information about the city and the 'Swedish way of life', very easygoing, and a lovely lady and i'm sure we'll meet again!
The place is cosy, very clean and well-organised, you can tell Maud is not new at the travellers scene !
I especially want to mention the well-equipped kitchen ( we cooked dinner every night - there's a small 'Coop'- and a big 'Maxi'-supermarket within walking distance ).
The apartment is 7 stops ( 15 min ) from the 'T-Central'-Subway/Train/Bus-stations and a five-minute walk from the Tunnelbana-Metro-Stop. 
The only reason not to book at Mauds would be a cat allergy. Greetings from Bruges Belgium !

8836,1212891,33085173,2015-05-25,2086438,Ksenia,"This place is amazing! Don't even hesitate to book it, it's absolutely great. First of all, Maud is super welcoming, you will feel completely at home during your stay. Then the location is great - it took us around 20 min, I think, to get to T-Centralen and it is in a very nice neighbourhood. We walked home from Gamla Stan once and you have a nice park pretty much the whole way. 
The room is exactly as described, we used kitchen a lot (you get your own place in the fridge and on the shelves and can use pans and such) and there are even teas and cookies left for you, which is always super nice. 
Oh, and there is a big grocery store right nearby with lots of choices and decent prices. And her cats are awesome. "
8837,1212891,33454614,2015-05-28,32367749,Sari,Maud var en perfekt värd. Personlig och vänlig. Vi kände oss mycket välkomna i hennes hem. Återkommer gärna.
8838,1212891,33611099,2015-05-30,33120601,Bruno,"Maud is a warm, kind and considerate lady and made me feel right at home :). The room was cosy and spotless. The apartment is located in a very calm neighborhood, near a large park, and within a short walk from the metro and shops. Great location. Extremely easy to find. Highly recommended."
8839,1212891,34071225,2015-06-04,32269450,Alexander,"Maud was very welcoming and hosted my wife and i with outmost respect. She made our two-day stay at her place very comfortable. Maud was also very organised and the room was clean, tidy and well put together. Her apartment is situated in a nice neighborhood, two minitues walk to the metro station which we used to go around the city. Also a big supermarket (ICA Maxi) is less than three minutes walk from the apartment which i found useful."
8840,1212891,34274055,2015-06-07,26868581,Alfred,"My girlfriend and I had a great time in Stockholm and booked with Airbnd for the first time. Maud is a really welcoming, warm and kind lady and we felt at home from the start. 

The apartment is very clean and cozy and the cats are lovely. The location is excellent: the neighboorhood is great and the metrostation and supermarket are close. 

Furthermore, Maud is a very helping person. She gave us valuable information about the city, for example about using the citybike network, which we really recommend in combination with a SL card. 

We would love to visit Stockholm again some time.. and hope we could then book with Maud again:)!

Thanks a lot Maud!"
8841,1212891,34762687,2015-06-12,25282859,Yenwen,"This is my first airbnb experience, and it is really great to have Maud as a host. I really feel like being at a friend's house, clean and easy. Maud is very nice and helpful. The small kitchen is also perfect because I can cook for my self everyday. The metro station and supermarket is just nearby, and the best part of the community is that the waterfront is in 3 mins walking distance. I walk along the waterfront every evening and feel really peace and relaxed. Because of this experience, I am sure I will use airbnb as a first choice for future trips. "
8842,1212891,34882456,2015-06-13,33639642,Anna," Maud was a great hostess for me and my 10-year-old son! She was very helpful and gave us a lot of useful tips where to go and what to do, that were better than those in the guide book. We felt very comfortable in her flat. The cats were well-behaved and cuddly. Maud kept the flat very clean all the time. Highly recommended! :-)"
8843,1212891,36948852,2015-07-03,30681847,Daniela,"Maud je skvělá hostitelka, je vidět, že má mnoho zkušeností. Ubytování bylo moc příjemné a já i můj přítel jsme byli nadšení - pokoj vypadal, jako kdyby na nás přímo čekal. Moc doporučuji všem - těm, kteří již zkušenosti s Airbnb mají, ale i těm, pro které je to poprvé (jako bylo pro mně ;) )"
8844,1212891,37078218,2015-07-04,20619812,Cristina,Maud was a wonderful host! She gives us everything and every information we could need! The house was 10 minutes with metro to central station! The room was quiet and very nice! 
8845,1212891,37448998,2015-07-07,10024815,Elizabeth,Maud made me feel very welcome. The room is cozy and the bed comfortable . Maud also gave me good suggestions  for touring the city.

8847,1212891,37714663,2015-07-09,2719228,Carolina & James,"Maud was very lovely and welcoming from the moment we came in. The room was really small, clean, and cozy, but we slept really well. Her two cats are really cute and were an added bonus. Even though our stay was for only one night, it was great. Definitely recommend this place. She even printed out our boarding passes for us when we were checking out (which she didn't have to do, but it was really nice of her to help us out). We forgot about the check out time though and stayed a bit later than we should have, but she was very understanding. "
8848,1212891,38092332,2015-07-13,5900896,Allison,"Maud made us feel extremely welcome from the moment she opened the door and gave us the tour. Her home is very close to the metro line and everything is described very well on the listing page. She is truly one of the most welcoming airbnb hosts. I really did feel at home during our 4 night stay, and had full access to her kitchen which I used extensively. The shared spaces are organized perfectly and labeled for guest use (there are 2 guest rooms available). Everything was very clean on arrival and stayed that way throughout our stay despite both of the guest rooms being occupied. Maud does a wonderful job! 

The area/neighborhood is very nice and cozy, and close to the waterfront and walking paths, as well as the huge grocery (and other item) store. We saw bunnies/hares all the time right outside the window, and had fun with Maud's cats as well. I saw very very minimal cat hair in the home (2 long haired cats), and did not have any allergy flare-ups. This is a great place and comfortable homely stay for a very reasonable price in Stockholm. "
8849,1212891,38286655,2015-07-14,29268909,Min,Maud and her home are super lovely!We have a nice time in there.   The room is also comfortable and clean with very good location. Highly recommend.
8850,1212891,38486384,2015-07-16,4647868,German,"My experience in Maud's apartment has been by far my best Airbnb so far ! Maud is very organized at letting you know what is on and off limits, and is very open to kitchen and bathroom use. You'll also get towels. There are 2 cats so keep in mind if you're allergic because even though they don't enter the rooms they are the furry type. Location wise you'll be a 10 min walk to the subway and a 15 min subway to downtow, It's not preciselly in the city center but for us it was great as we prefer somwhere calm. "
8851,1212891,39473886,2015-07-24,20070549,Allison,"Séjour très agréable chez Maud ! Son appartement est fidèle à la description. Tout est très bien organisé et bien pensé. La cuisine et la salle de bain sont utilisables en toute liberté. Maud est une personne très accueillante et serviable, tout à fait disposée à donner des renseignements sur la vie à Stockholm. 
L'appartement est par ailleurs très bien placé, à cinq minutes à pied du métro et des supermarchés environnants. De plus le quartier est très agréable, avec la proximité de quais donnant sur le lac Mälar. Il est possible à l'occasion de longer ces quais à pied (environ 1h) ou à vélo jusqu'au centre historique de Stockholm, Gamla Stan. "
8852,1212891,39752758,2015-07-26,32896851,Manon,Maud est une personne accueillante. La chambre est très bien. Maud vous fournira beaucoup de renseignements sur la ville de maniere très précise.
8853,1212891,40198839,2015-07-29,4788619,Vanessa,Maud is such an amazing host and a lovely person. She makes you feel so welcome enough that you are comfortable enough to sing and dance. Her place is extremely organised and impeccable. It was 5minutes from a large supermarket and 5 minutes from the metro that takes you into the city in 10 minutes. I would definitely recommend staying here and wouldn't hesitate to stay again.
8854,1212891,40470814,2015-07-31,9224709,Paola,"Maud was so friendly, we arrived very late and she was waiting for us down on the street corner to be sure we could find the way. We felt at home, her cats are lovely too. The room is bright and full of light, the flat clean and the cooking facility so confortable. The underground close to her place and easy to reach. Maud was very kind and did the best for us. We had a good time as she has a great sense of hospitality."
8855,1212891,41065396,2015-08-04,30628163,Dominik,"Maud gave me a very friendly welcome from the time I entered. She then started to explain how things are working and showed me my room for the next days, which were very comfortable. I didn't ever sleep so well during a journey as in this quiet little room.  But also her two sweet cats gave me the feeling of being at home. 

To the public transportation system (subway) it's just a few minutes of walk and also two supermarkets are quite close.

I only can recommend a stay with Maud if you're going to go to beautiful Stockholm!"
8856,1212891,41254877,2015-08-05,47027,Shinko,"Maud is one of the most conscientious and thoughtful hosts that we have ever stayed with. You don't even realize how small her apt is because she takes care of every single detail. Our room was spotless and she keeps the entire apartment clean even though she has two (gorgeous) cats and another guest when we were there. She marks down everything clearly in her apt for her guests so that it is clear what is ok for them to use - I really appreciated that. It was very easy to get to the city center, and I would highly recommend Maud's place to anyone as it is excellent value for money. Also her cats are hypo-allergenic so don't worry even if you have cat allergies :) "
8857,1212891,41585985,2015-08-08,17960629,Guillaume,"Maud is a very nice and welcoming person. We were even offered food! 
You have better use metro if you want to go in the city center, but the place is nice and still"

8859,1212891,43609416,2015-08-21,30847673,Sebastian,Perfect stay! Maud gave us a warm welcome and was always helpful and friendly. We liked the clean flat and the location of it. We would definetly recommend a stay here.
8860,1212891,43815391,2015-08-22,37850188,Rongman,This is a great place to live. I love the Lake nearby. And the cats are very cute. An amazing and wonderful trip. A very kind host. Highly recommend!
8861,1212891,44096857,2015-08-24,10202644,Marietta,"Maud is a very welcoming host, she has an excellent colour coding scheme, and notes aound the house, so the guests in the two bedrooms know exactly what to use. The bedroom is a decent size with a comfortable size, the bathroom though small has a wide range of toiletteries for the use of the guests.
  Although another long term guest was using the other bedroom, we were not really inconvenienced.
  Maud's accomodation is very handy to the metro line, and the supermarket is within walking distance. Maud gave us some good tips on sightseeing, which proved to be very useful."
8862,1212891,44630649,2015-08-28,22706353,Firouz,"It was great being back at Maud's place, which is the perfect combination of staying in a quiet suburb and being able to make it to central Stockholm  in 15 minutes or less. Maud was really helpful as usual, and even offered to pick up a few items for me when she was on her way to the grocery store. The room is  comfortable and ( just as the smaller one) on the sunny side of the building -- but there's a dark curtain you can roll down if you need to block the early morning sun i the summer."
8863,1212891,44792278,2015-08-29,38317776,Laura,"Maud è molto accogliente e premurosa, attenta ai dettagli e precisa sia nelle spiegazioni che nelle regole di casa. Ne risulta una buona organizzazione per una tranquilla convivenza anche in presenza di altri ospiti. Abbiamo trovato l'appartamento senza difficoltà."
8864,1212891,44912762,2015-08-30,1766074,Mike,Perfectly priced room in Stockholm. Conveniently located closed to the Metro. Maud is a very caring host. Great instructions on how to use everything. Quiet room with a comfortable bed. Must like cats (I do) . 
8865,1212891,45240864,2015-09-01,30847673,Sebastian,Perfect stay! Maud gave us a warm welcome and was always helpful and friendly. We liked the clean flat and the location of it. We would definetly recommend a stay here.

She made us felt at home from the welcome (with a wonderful smile) until the ""see you soon"". She was happy to help us always the we needed it. The house has several ""plusses"" as free shower gel, cofee, tea, herbs to cook... Etc. All the house is well-equipped and very clean. She helped us to find information about public transport, places to visit, places to buy food... Etc. I strongly recommend to stay at Maud's place. Everything was PERFECT!!! "

8868,1212891,46366478,2015-09-10,11151556,Pippa,Maud was very friendly and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable. The location is about 5 minutes from the train station and was convenient for getting into central Stockholm. We also walked along the water to the old town which was very pleasant. The cats too were incredibly cute. Thank you for a good stay.
8869,1212891,46709433,2015-09-13,36497629,Sorcha,"Great location, only 15 minutes to town on the metro. Nice safe neighbourhood, plenty to do and see. Good for the price. "
8870,1212891,47457663,2015-09-19,5376799,Laura,"It was really great to stay with Maud. We were warmly welcomed and the room was nice. Maud is a very nice, warm, helpful and amazing person. You can ask her everything and she tries to make everything perfect for you. The location is also great - Near the sea and not far away from the city center going by metro (or even by walking if you have time). 
You can really feel home here and for sure you will enjoy your holidays while staying with Maud!

A perfect place to stay! Thank you!
We will come again!"
8871,1212891,48163863,2015-09-24,32513486,Cristian,"Maud truly is as amazing as the other guests say she is! From the moment we met her, she inspired us with kindness and sympathy. We really enjoyed the time spent there, visiting Stockholm, seeing and living some of the Swedish wonders, making a lot of extraordinary memories and experiencing incredible adventures. Maud took care of everything so we felt really comfortable in her cozy apartment and for that we are grateful and we thank her, because through optimism and a warm and joyful aura she made our stay really wonderful. 
Thank you, Maud!"
8872,1212891,48297442,2015-09-25,41914795,Łukasz,"I am very pleased with generosity of Maud, who is very cordial and she didn't hesitate to make the effort so that we could have great memories from Stockholm. Maud is very jovial with what she intrigued us and we spent the whole time in the excellent mood. The bedroom in which she welcomed us was flawlessly clean. I highly recommend with the sense of value and class which Maud offers."
8873,1212891,48513242,2015-09-27,6186597,Fred,This was my second time with Maud and was truly coming back to an old friend.  This time I noticed more all of the small details and plants that she maintains around the house - perfect and all blooming - does she have a greenhouse hidden somewhere>  Her other guests and friends/past guests stop by and a great time is to be had.  See you again in 20??.!
8874,1212891,48716199,2015-09-28,40902056,Allison,"Maud was a truly wonderful host! She was as experienced with AirBnB as you can get. She had notes everywhere, towels ready to go, water on the bedside table, Stockholm travel book on table, etc. She has a great system for checking in and out where you can come any time using a code. She is very friendly and easy-going and makes you feel very welcomed in her home. 

This was our first visit to Stockholm and Maud's place initially caught our eye because of her relatively very low price to others, even though she's on the outskirts of the city. Because we didn't know the area, we didn't realize that we'd be taking taxis/ubers/the Metro to get back and forth to the City and Gamla Stan so frequently, and that it probably would have been the same if not less expensive to stay in a more central location. It's something to consider and research ahead of time and take into consideration with the price when planning your trip. 

However we have no regrets staying with Maud and really enjoyed meeting her and staying with her in Stockholm! She is by far the most professional and organized host we have stayed with yet using this site."
8875,1212891,48987584,2015-09-30,22203453,Helena,"Maud är en jättebra värdinna. Väldigt trivsamt, välordnat och rent boende. Har bott här vid flera tillfällen och återkommer gärna."

The two cats were also very cute! 
In the near of the house are some restaurants and shops if you want to cook yourself. The water and a park are also only a few minutes away.
It just takes about 5 minutes to walk to the tunnelbana station and about 10 minutes to the central station. 
we would stay at maud's again :)"

The best part was that Maud went above and beyond to help me to send my money that I accidentally left in behind in the room. Thanks for your kindness and honesty. Much appreciated Maud!
8883,1212891,51366884,2015-10-19,43105882,Alice,"It was such a wonderful experience living in Maus's house. I arrived at very late night(about 12 pm) and didn't find my way right at first. Maud still go downstairs and opened the door for me. She gave me very clear instruction in her house. Maud is very kind and professional! All the things I need and all the questions I want to ask she has already written them down in the handbook. She can speak nice English and has 2 lovely cats. She has good personality. The room in her house actually is even nicer than the photo! Everything is clean, tidy, lovely, comfortable  and make me have a very good memory in Maud's house! Her house is near the train station and by train there, you can easily get to central station in short time! Strongly recommended!"

Her place is very clean and well managed, even there're 2 cats inside, but she told us how to do with them, and they are so cute too :) the location is quite far from center, but with the metro card (which you definitely buy it to travel around stockholm) it's so easy and doesnt take long time to go to attractions. I definitely stay at Maud's place again if I have a chance to visit Stockholm :)"

8886,1212891,52479603,2015-10-30,39207135,Elisabeth,"We had a very nice time in Stockholm, the flat is easy to find thanks to a very detailed description, and Maud is a very considerate and attentive host. In the kitchen and bathroom everything is labeled clearly, so things are easy to find and it is easy to see what can be used.
Even with 4 people sharing the flat there were never any problems with bathroom or kitchen times.
Be aware that the bed is not extremly wide and a little bit worn, but it was ok for us.
The location of the flat is perfect for visiting Stockholm, as the metro stop is very near, and all the trains of the green line stop there. It was also very clean, even though there are 2 cats."

Ihre Wohnung war sehr sauber und alles super und professionell organisiert. 
Ihre beiden Katzen sind wirklich süß und eine von ihnen hat uns immer Gesellschaft in der Küche geleistet :)
Das Zimmer ist genau wie auf dem Foto und ideal für ein Pärchen.
Auch die Lage ist gut, es gibt einen Supermarkt und man ist mit der U-Bahn schnell im Stockholmer Zentrum.

Maud ist absolut weiterzuempfehlen!
Vielen Dank!"

The room is very cozy, and not too far away from main attractions, like The Old City. I would definitely stay there again, if Maud would have me! "
8890,1212891,54999429,2015-11-27,46853250,Ashley,"Maud is amazing! I recommend her to anyone! She is a very kind and accommodating host.  My boyfriend and I stayed two nights in Novemeber.  We truly appreciated her generosity when she prepared a homemade meal for us.  We talked a lot and Maud showed us some personal family photos.  Her cats are sweet and social.  The room itself was very private and homey.  The bed was extremely comfortable and the perfect size for two adults.  The location was far enough away from the city where we were amongst locals and away from a lot of tourist traps.  The metro was close so it was a short ride into the heart of Stockholm.  I would advise purchasing a 72 hour SL access card for the train upon arriving.  Overall, we had a great time with Maud and would stay with her again in a heartbeat. "
8891,1212891,56716501,2015-12-17,22203453,Helena,Jättetrevligt som vanligt
8892,1212891,58790648,2016-01-05,44783730,Jan,"Maud hat uns mit einem warmherzigen und freundlichen Lächeln begrüßt und uns alle nötigen Dinge für unseren Aufenthalt bereitgestellt. 
Das Zimmer war groß genug, damit zwei Menschen sich darin ausbreiten können. Es gab neben dem Bett einen kleinen Kleiderschrank, einen Tisch und mehrere Schränkchen mit Schubläden. In diesen befand sich neben nützlichen Dingen auch eine Mappe mit Informationen über verschiedene Attraktionen rund um Stockholm. Das Bett war mit 1,20 Meter gerade ausreichend für zwei Personen, aber super neu und komfortabel. 
Wir haben uns zu jeder Zeit super wohl gefühlt und konnten uns an allen Sachen bedienen, die wir zum Leben/Schlafen/Kochen benötigt haben. 
Auch war Maud uns stets mit Rat und Tat zur Seite gestanden, als Fragen bezüglich Stockholm aufkamen. Diese beantwortete sie sofort durch verschiedene Karten und Flyern, vielen Informationen und einem ständigen Lächeln. 
Die Wohnung selbst liegt etwa zehn Minuten von der nächsten S-Bahn-Station entfernt und die Fahrt ins Zentrum dauert ungefähr 15 Minuten.
Maud war einfach eine mega herzliche Gastgeberin, die dafür gesorgt hat, dass man sich als Gast rundum wohlfühlt und es einem an nichts mangelt!
"
8893,1212891,58827341,2016-01-05,45209174,Nanami,"It was really nice room. It is good access to city centre such as 10 min by train and 10 min walk. The room is clean, and Maud is very kind. I recommend this room;)"
8894,1212891,61559718,2016-02-06,51752426,Anna,"We spent two nights at Maud's and liked it a lot! Maud is how others describe her: a warm and caring person. She immediatly told us some do's and don'ts in Stockholm and made us feel very welcome. Every room is adapted to frequent visitors and to make it an easy stay for them. We slept in the purple room, which is not too big, but very cosy and it has everything you need. The bed is big enough for two (couple or just friends), if you don't need too much space and don't mind sleeping close to each other. The environment is a good living environment, but we always went for breakfast to the old city and got back after dinner. One morning, we walked along the frozen river from Maud's to the City Hall, which was beautiful! 
We didn't stay long enough to use the kitchen, so we can't say anything about that, but everything was neat and available to use. 

I can only conclude that it is a nice spot, a great lady and a stay I would definitely recommend. "
8895,1212891,61777294,2016-02-08,24410799,Hana,It was a very nice stay at Maud's place. She helps a lot in helping us searching for the right transport or anything while we're in Stockholm. There's also a cafe around the neighborhood that you can stop by and have some coffee on the way back. It's just an awesome experience in the nutshell. 
8896,1212891,62161711,2016-02-12,16943618,Isabelle,"Maud war über alle Maße zuvorkommend und hilfsbereit, das Zimmer und die gesamte Wohnung sauber und sehr schön eingerichtet! Auch die Nähe zur Innenstadt spricht für sich. Nur zu empfehlen!

There were absolutly no problems with interection, kitchen and bathroom are yours almost anytime, or you can arrange the special time. Maud is so hospitable, she provided all needed information and gave all instruction about her home. You can ask her whatever you need any time! Room is clean and really cozy, we felt like staying at home. Location is good, it is near 3 minutes walking to the metro (tunnelbana) and 10 minutes to the city-center by metro. Thanks again, Maud, you are great!"

The room is exactly as the picture shows, everything works and Maud keeps the house impeccably clean at all times- we were very impressed! The house has cute little notes offering instructions in case you are ever stuck. The neighbourhood is lovely with a park and big supermarket close by and just a 15 minute tube ride from central. Her cats are also a big highlight, fluffy and friendly :)"

8902,1212891,64778572,2016-03-08,5286118,Liliya,"Maud was a great host, she told everything about the apartment and the city. We liked everything - the location, the coziness of the place, it was quiet but close to the city center. We were walking by foot all the time, and the location was perfect for that. The appartment is located in an old house, but it it really really comfortable and Maud made our stay nice. Thank you!"
8903,1212891,68293736,2016-04-04,50422427,Anna,"I spend four weeks in Stockholm and lived in Maud's flat, which was just the right choice! I enjoyed the cordial and welcoming atmosphere she creates, I felt to be at home quickly and had everything I need. I appreciated the little extras like coffee, tea, oil, shampoo,.. and just living with someone who welcomes you heartily after a long day!
Thank you, Maud!"

Her home was lovely! We stayed in the purple room. It was the sweetest and also the tidiest room we have ever stayed. And the candys that she gives as a gift was perfect! Even she has a cat the house were clean. Taking your shoes when you enter the home is also effective in this cleanliness. We stayed just one night but we would stay more. If we ever come to Stockholm again, we absolutely prefer Maud's home! :)"
8906,1212891,69531811,2016-04-11,64791033,Irmantas,"This was my first booking through airbnb and I can say it was great. Maud is very kind and helpful but also respects privacy. The bed is amazing, it works wonders after a long day of going around Stockholm. The neighbourhood is very quiet and feels safe late in the evening. Public transport is as described, you get from your doorstep to city centre in like 20-30 mins. Overall, I can surely recommend it."

Walking distance from the central station if you like a longer walk around 40-45 minutes! Its a nice stroll through a park and beautiful architecture. Perfect wifi of course, and nice view from the window"
8910,1212891,70863947,2016-04-21,11913528,Felicia,Maud was an excellent host. She went through everything with me and made me feel right at home.  The location is in a residential area 6 minutes from the subway station with a massive supermarket about 5 minutes away. I was traveling alone and it was really easy to get around and come back from a long day of exploring the beautiful stockholm. My only regret is not being able to get to know Maud more as I was in and out most of the day. Great place to stay.

8942,1212891,91089082,2016-08-03,27372535,Chloé & Matthieu,"We loved to spend five days at the place of Maud!

The apartment is like the photos. The purple room is tidy and cosy. The neighbourhood is very quiet and beautiful (especially the docks during sunset!) with a big supermarket close.

At Maud's, everything is at our disposal for feeling like home and it works! 

The cleanliness is flawless, it's hard to believe that two cats live here because there is never cat hairs on the floor or litter odor. 

Maud is the kindest person in the world and we already regret not staying longer. She is really the best Airbnb host you can find.

Sammy and Dione are adorable. They are both soft and cute and Sammy loves playing!

This Airbnb experience was perfect. The only  ""bad point"" is that Maud  will really miss us. "
8943,1212891,91596548,2016-08-06,76080468,Florine,"Maud and her two cats were really nice and welcoming. The purple room was exactly like described by the photos, very clean and cosy. I stayed two days with my boyfriend and we think that the quality of the apartment (the room, the bathroom and the rest of the apartment) was similar to a good hotel but with the proximity of the host and nice cats ;) For the kitchen we had a special shelf in the fridge and in a piece of furniture and it was very pleasant. In short, we recommend the room and will come back if we return to Stockholm!"

Everything is well organised with cute and complete little notes. Another guest was in the other room but we did not have problems with the organisation (time of use of Kitchen, bathroom,...). Plus, there are two lovely cats but everything was clean (they cannot get in the room).
The room is cosy and the neighborhood very peaceful. 
Maud made everything for us to have a great stay in Stockholm. Thank you once again Maud, we really enjoyed!"

She has such a warm and inviting personality and her home is the same. Everything is clearly labelled so your stay is easy. The room was perfect, very clean and cozy. The kitchen is lovely to eat in and watch the neighbourhood outside. We absolutely loved the neighbourhood where Maud lives. Short walk to the transit station and so many great restaurants by the water to check out. Maud was also extremely helpful in answering any questions we had. And of course, the cats were adorable and made the stay even better. We highly recommend Maud's place to stay in Stockholm and would definitely return in the future!"

The neighbourhood is pretty quiet, but still a big supermarket is close, as well as the metro to the city centre. A perfect location. I can't say anything about the stay which I didn't like, it was just perfect!"

Maud was super helpful while planning our outings into Stockholm and was very friendly and welcoming. The place is a little far out of the city but we actually preferred that, as we had a chance to sit back and enjoy Swedish life by the waterside and joined the Swedes in tanning and exercising along the brilliant walkways and bikeways around the islands. The bike lanes were very impressive and made a trip to the city quite quick and enjoyable especially when you can take a stop at one of the many cafes along the way. The nearest hire bike station was a little walk away but we didn't mind, as we had great weather.
Thank you for your hospitality Maud. You made our stay in Stockholm very welcoming and enjoyable! "

8957,1212891,101612473,2016-09-14,52892699,Shannon,"Maud was a lovely host and her apartment is very charming. I stayed in the purple room with a single bed which was very comfortable. She was feeling under the weather but still made an effort to find out about my trip and answer any questions I had. I had an evening flight and she let me leave my bags in her living room until I needed to get to the airport. 

The only cons I have are 9 am check out (too early). And the location is pretty far from the city center (15 min drive). I was only in Stockholm for a day and a half so I ended up taking Ubers everywhere rather than transit to save time. That got very expensive. Looking back I wish I payed more and stayed in the town center since I was there for such a short time. I absolutely recommend her house for longer trips but for 1-2 days I wouldn't go back. 

Thank you Maud for the lovely time in Stockholm!
Shannon"

We had everything we needed, she let us use all her kitchen supplies and anything else you need for the everyday life and helped us out with any questions we had. Her apartment is located perfectly, only 5 minutes away to the metro station which takes you to center city within 10 minutes or less. Her cat Sammy was the cherry on top, such a cute and lovely cat. We enjoyed our stay at Maud's apartment very much and would come back anytime soon. :)"

Maud was warm and welcoming and kindly made herself very late for me so I could check in before she went out after my arrival from the airport. All her advice on trains and directions were spot on and she made it easy. Thank you Maud for making my trip a successful one.

Die Wohnung war immer sehr sauber, auch am Zimmer kann man nichts beanstanden. Die Küche war sehr gut ausgestattet, und auch an Kräutern an Gewürzen, etc. war alles wichtige vorhanden und konnte mitbenutzt werden. 
Die Wohnung liegt einige Gehminuten von einer U-Bahnhaltestelle entfernt, mit der die ganze Stadt gut erreichbar ist. "

Zawsze była do naszej dyspozycji, w każdym momencie mogliśmy liczyć na jej pomoc i radę. Mieszkanie znajduje sie w cichej okolicy, dotarcie do centrum zajmuje ok.20/25 min (10 min dojście do metra, 15 min zajmuje dojazd do centum). Dodatkowym plusem jest przemiły kot imieniem Sammy, którego nie sposób nie polubić :) "
8976,1212891,120626789,2016-12-11,13948758,Nadiia,"The place is very nice and very clean. Maud is a perfect host. She has useful tips how to use everything in the house. Although, she herself stayed in the living room, so whenever we needed to go out of the room (to bathroom, kitchen or out) we always went through the living room, which she is fine with, and we were not very bothered as stayed only two days (but for longer stay and some people this might be important). I love the location, it's 7 min to the tube station ad then only 3-5 stops to central station and Gamla Stan. Overall, the flat is definitely value for money!"
8977,1212891,121117016,2016-12-14,94268597,Clara,"Although we were only in Stockholm for a few days, we felt right at home. Maud was such a welcoming host, and her apartment is spacious and clean. The location was just a 5 min walk from the closest metro station and a short train ride away from the city center. There is also a large grocery store nearby. Maud was easy to reach with questions and even provided us with a guide book and map in the room. Her cat Sammy is very sweet and made our stay even more enjoyable. "

Maud也是超級可愛,非常熱情的主人,她從早期的沙發客開始就願意接待各國的訪客,真是一位很nice的友人｡希望下次來Stockholm還住在這裡!"

The neigborhood is nice and calm and we can get into the center in 15 minutes our less even by bus. It was a perfect decision to ask Maud to be our host. 
8987,1212891,132298546,2017-02-17,56038856,Thomas,Très agréable passage chez Maud pour découvrir la ville de Stockholm. Maud fait preuve de beaucoup de gentillesse envers ses invités et facilite grandement notre passage en se rendant disponible. Encore merci pour les petits gâteaux ;-)

The home is clean and small, but has all that a traveler would need: towels, tea, wall adapter, kitchen, guide books, a fluffy cat, slippers (of many sizes), good wifi, good heating (I wore shorts mostly while it snowed outside), did I mention the cat? It's right near a big grocery store, right next to metro and bus stops, and above all, Maud is very kind, warm, and welcoming. I spent a lot of time sleeping off jet lag or exploring the city, but Maud is always happy to talk and give advice. I highly recommend her place."
8991,1212891,135077111,2017-03-03,116689941,Adrian,"It was BRILLIANT 
The communication before the stay was perfect - Maud was so helpful and responsive. She even waited quite late at night because we took the wrong metro.

When we arrived, Maud was patiently giving us all practical information about the house. They were even written too, so it was really handy!

About the room - it was super clean and well-equipped. Couldn't have asked for more.

Overall, the stay was perfect and even better than staying in a hotel. Thank you so much for the hospitality, Maud and Sammy! It was really nice meeting you. "
8992,1212891,135797156,2017-03-06,18011105,Veronika,everything was great!! its true that this accommodation is not exactly at the centre of stockholm but the metro station is cca 5 min by foot!! maud is very nice!! thank you
8993,1212891,137249508,2017-03-14,102638793,Elena,"Maud is basically the most perfect host you can ever have. She's nice, helpful, polite and funny. Whenever she can she will help you with everything. 
When I was planning my trip to Stockholm, I searched for a host that had nice ratings and some experience on this site because it was my first time traveling with AirBnb. As a host Maud has raised the standards and I'm definitely traveling again through this site thanks to her (and also if I come back to Stockholm I will stay with her again for sure!!).

Sammy, her cat, is really quiet and easy to get along with, he is such a nice and funny cat!

The house location was perfect in my opinion. It is located on a residential area so everything is quiet and relaxing, you can also see how Swedes live. There's a big supermarket REALLY close from Maud's home and there you can find anything you need. Also, it was really easy to go to the main attractions and the most famous parts of the city through the metro/subway (which is 4min by walking from Maud's home). I visited almost every single part of Stockholm in a matter of 3 days!

I have really enjoyed my trip in Stockholm and I would like to thank Maud because without her and her beautiful home it would not have been the same!!

The house rules may not suit everyone (there are quite a few rules in place to make sure Maud's cat doesn't get up to mischief or accidentally escape). Maud's sleeping arrangements are not so common in airbnb either - Maud screens off a section of the living room at night for her to sleep, however that worked fine and there wasn't a problem. Maud's kitchen is really well fit-out and she is very generous to set aside ample room in the fridge and cupboard for guests.
Maud's place is very organised and communication is excellent. I would definitely recommend!"

La ubicación muy buena, un vecindario muy tranquilo, accesible desde la estación central con el metro en solo unos minutos. La casa de Maud muy acogedora y limpia con todas las condiciones tanto para dormir como el baño y la cocina. Todo muy bien organizado. Maud muy amable y dispuesta a ayudar en todo lo posible, pone a tu disposición café, te y otros básicos para cocinar. También gel de baño, champú y otros productos para el baño. 
Muy contenta con mi estancia en su casa, si volvemos seguro repetiremos :) Ahhh y Sammy, el gato todo un personaje, muy lindo y tranquilo."

She was extremely friendly and helpful and tried to make our stay as nice as possible. Her cat Sammy is very friendly. Maud rents out two rooms, the ""green room"" with a twin bed and the ""purple room"" and puts up screens around her bed in the living room at night. Sharing the bathroom was never an issue. The ""purple room"" has a nice big window, pretty orchids, a desk and area for hanging up some clothes, and a bed that's 120 cm wide (a standard full bed is about 135 cm). It's a pretty cozy room for two but certainly can work, especially for couples. We enjoyed our conversations with Maud and appreciated her kind and warm demeanor."

The location is convenient (6-7 minute walk to metro and there are restaurants and supermarkets also within a 10 minute walking distance) and Maud's organization is down to a T with her labels for designated towels, fridge space, etc. and clear directions to get to her place and house rules.

Мод гостеприимна и очень-очень деликатна, если нужна какая-то помощь или совет, к ней можно обратиться практически в любое время суток, а если хочется уединения, то никто беспокоить не будет. Все очень грамотно организовано, в том числе на кухне и в ванной. В квартире есть все необходимое, очень чисто. Кунгсхольмен - отличный уютный район, прямо влюбились в него. До метро 3 минуты, а на нем всего 10 минут по прямой до Гамла Стана. Мы один раз даже прогулялись пешком из центра - это заняло минут 40. Рядом с домом большой супермаркет и алкомаркет (Мод все расскажет и покажет). Ну и конечно совершенно очаровал Сэмми!"

The Purple Room is beautiful, clean and comfortable. I slept incredibly well.

The house's location is perfect as it is close to the metro/subway. You can get to the city centre in a matter of minutes. It's a fantastic location to get around Stockholm and visit everything. Also, there's a big supermarket and a caffeteria next to the house, 2-minute walk.

La comunicación con ella ha sido fluida tanto antes como durante la estancia.
La habitación es tal cual aparece en la foto, está muy limpia y es cómoda para dos personas. El resto de la casa tiene todo lo necesario para pasar los días cómodamente.
La casa, pese a no estar muy céntrica, tiene buena comunicación en metro (estación de Kristineberg) y en autobús. Nosotros íbamos en metro y se tarda entre 15-20 en llegar al centro. Es una zona tranquila y segura.
Si volvemos a Estocolmo, repetiríamos alojamiento!"

Her cozy appartement is super clean and pretty centrally located. A huge supermarket as well as the Train Station are only a couple of minutes away by foot and the train only takes 10 minutes to the city centre.

We enjoyed our stay at Maud's place a lot and recommend staying at her place!"
9104,1212891,318649605,2018-09-04,185677471,Masako,"I highly recommend this airbnb. It is a very clean room, you can get sunshine from the lovely window. Information she gives is totally enough. It is located in peace and quiet area, and also easy to access to the central. She had been such a nice host - she welcomed me warmly, so I could feel at home immediately:)"
9105,1212891,320246189,2018-09-08,95963924,Chris,"Maud is a very cheerful and welcoming host. As a guest you will appreciate the nice touches that make your travel experience just that little bit more pleasant. For example, lovely filtered coffee is on hand for anyone who desires it.

Maud's apartment is very well located, a 10 minute ride from the city via the subway. Subway trains run on a very regular schedule. Despite the proximity to the city the neighbourhood is very peaceful and quiet. We enjoyed our 4 night stay at Maud's apartment. We recommend it for singles and couples on a short stay. Sammy the cat is also very sweet."

She was super nice, hospitable and warmhearted and Sammy (the cat) was just sooo adorable!! Maud wrote us a detailed and very, very helpful directions on how to find the address before we landed at Sweden, which made it a lot easier. The (purple) room is so cozy and has everything needed. We also had our own personal space in almost every part of the home. The apartment itself is very close to the subway station, just about 5 minutes by foot.  
We left early in the morning, so I couldn't say goodbye properly so I will just write here - thank you for such a nice first airbnb experience!"

Elle est une hôte très disponible, donne toutes les informations nécessaires pour arriver facilement chez elle depuis l’aéroport. Son logement est bien desservi, deux lignes de bus passent au pied de son immeuble et une station de métro à 5mn à pied. On trouve aussi des restaurants et commodités tout autour. 
On rejoint le centre en 10-15mn en métro. 
La chambre est petite mais cosy, l’espace est largement suffisant si vous êtes de sortie toute la journée et revenez juste pour dormir. Si vous souhaitez passer plus de temps dans le logement, tout est prévu pour vous de la cuisine à la salle de bain. 
Personnellement j’ai trouvé la literie super confortable ! Des oreillers et couvertures supplémentaires sont à disposition en cas de besoin mais nous avions largement assez.
Nous avons adoré discuter avec Maud et jouer avec Sammy à notre retour chaque soir. Maud, merci de votre gentillesse !"

Highly recommend this apartment!
Highly recommend this apartment!
This apartment is absolutely cost-efficient, and it took us 2 minutes to the bus station nearby and 6 minuets  to the metro station, so it’s super convenient to go everywhere!
And there is a big supermarket near this apartment, so if you can easily buy everything you need.
Maud is so kind to us, she made us feel like staying in our own apartment! And she gave us a lot of advice, and if you want, you can talk a lot with Maud, She is very nice!
Of course, Sammy, Sammy is a little angel, OMG, I will miss Sammy. Haha 
So, I will recommend this apartment to my friends. Haha.
Thank you so much, Maud!"
9133,1212891,440789532,2019-04-21,17515466,Romeu,"Maud é uma pessoa muito simpática e que faz tudo o que é possível para agradar aos hóspedes. O espaço é modesto mas limpo, preenchendo as necessidades básicas de uma estadia curta. A privacidade é limitada, pelo facto de Maud dormir na sala de estar, local de passagem do quarto dos hóspedes para a casa de banho e cozinha. O acesso à cozinha é total, o que possibilita, a quem o quiser, fazer umas refeições mais baratas, fator importante atendendo ao elevado preço dos restaurantes (e de todo o comércio) em Estocolmo. O tempo de deslocação até ao centro é de cerca de 20 minutos. Em resumo, é uma boa opção para quem não quiser gastar muito dinheiro em alojamento."

She is a great host and gave very specific instructions about everything at the apartment. The house was very well kept and organised. Sammy, her cat was non-interfering and friendly. 
The bathroom was super clean and Maud had kept so many shampoos and creams for us to use. There were colour coded sections and towels for the guests of each room. I liked that idea very much.
We had a great stay at Maud’s place."

Maud is a very accommodating host, who made us feel totally welcome. Her hosting experience is demonstrated by her organisation, she really had thought of every possible little thing we might need

Sammy (cat) was also a very friendly host, which made us feel 'at home'

We would definitely recommend this place"

The room is exactly as described and the location is great too - just a few stops from the city centre, in a safe neighbourhood. Maud does her best so that her guests enjoy their stay and Sammy, her cat, is the most lovable being. If you like cats, he will make this visit one to remember. There is also a supermarket nearby and the area is quite quiet at night, which is a bonus. If we ever go back to Stockholm, we'll stay with them again."

Je recommande ce airbnb !"
9162,1212891,518797333,2019-08-27,194658236,Darren,"Maud (and Sammy the cat) was a very warm and welcoming host. We were a little surprised that Maud did not have a bedroom as the second bedroom was occupied by a student lodger.  This meant Maud slept on the sofa in the lounge,  adjacent to our bedroom, behind a curtain. This wasn’t a problem, we just had to be mindful to be quiet when going to the bathroom or kitchen during the night. Maud goes to extraordinary lengths to give you space for food and toiletries in her house. 
Even though check out is 10am, she had allows guests to leave their luggage there until later in the day, she really is very kind.
The local supermarket, equivalent to a TESCO express, is only 5-10 min walk, nearest tube is 10 min walk. The waterfront is also only 10 min walk which is where we sat and ate breakfast in the sun and had a swim on a hot day!
Great public transport links to city centre, however, if you’ve got 45 mins to spare, you could do the 4km walk all along the waters edge into the centre of Stockholm, which gives you a lovely opportunity to take in the sights. 
All in all, brilliant host, fantastic location and really good price. 
What are you waiting for - book now!"

The bathroom is shared with the host and perhaps a guest in the second bedroom. The host is helpful and thoughtful. She has a nice cat named Sammy. The place is a 5 - 10 minute walk from a metro (Tunnelbana) station, so it is easy to get around Stockholm from here. Getting to know this woman was a big part of my happy visit to Stockholm!"

9182,1228583,486283570,2019-07-12,49824603,Hilary,"Staying at Linda’s felt like we were staying at a friend’s house, which is what we love about AirBnB! Communication with Linda was quick, easy, and she provided plenty of information and tips for our stay. Her apartment was stylish yet homely, and a great location for exploring the Sodermalm area. Great view too! Thanks again Linda!"
9183,1231897,5170270,2013-06-16,6382140,Katerina,"First of all thanx to Alexander for nice atmosphere he created for us!!! Really nice and friendly person. 
He tried to make our time there as comfortable as possible. And what is very important - he was not pesky. 
About apartment: its located in calm green area of Stockholm 2-3 min away from Tunelbana (Subway) and 20 min from City Center. By my opinion, if u want to learn how is real  Swedish people live – u should stay in this area! Apartment has everything u may need. Its clean, cozy, with bright rooms, lovely kitchen with big table – perfect for friendly dinner or wine party like we had))) 
Unfortunately we could not use the small nice sunny balcony … – it was raining…but next time we would love to have breakfast there. 
Conclusion- if u want to save some money and ready to spend some time on the road to Center its prefect place to stay. 
Don’t forget to try Alexander’s tea – its in the right cupboard up and its really tasty!!))))

Le quartier au calme, très typique de la vie suédoise, à seulement 10 min en transports du centre ville de Stockholm. C'est l'endroit idéal pour décompresser dans un cadre agréable après de longues journées dans le cœur de la capitale scandinave. L'appartement est très sympa, rangé et propre. L'ensemble des éléments de l'appartement sont utilisables et mis à disposition.

Alexander est très sympa, un suédois qui aime la vie et la nature. Il est attentionné, toujours disponible sans être envahissant et investi pour que le séjour se passe bien. Alexander a tout fait pour nous donner des conseils pratiques et touristiques, qui ont eu un grand rôle dans la réussite de notre séjour. Les attentions comme le petit déjeuner offert le premier matin ont été très appréciées.

Une super première expérience avec AirBnB. Hôte sérieux et agéable à recommander !
Merci à toi Alexander et à bientôt ! :-)"

The bathroom was clean and the shower was hot.  Best part of the experience was meeting Alex, and checking out Stockholm through his eyes.  Alex was also great with organising a washing machine and dryer so I could do laundry.  If you're coming to Stockholm, I'd recommend Alex's place!"
9188,1231897,45028669,2015-08-30,35811827,Harmeet,"Alexander was really helpful and kind. We really enjoyed our stay. He  even went out of his way to help us when we lost our way to the flat. The house is well connected to the train. Clean and Tidy!

He is an amazing host, definitely coming back. 

Any one looking at this property- Book it now!!!"
9189,1231897,46059873,2015-09-07,42687754,Michael,"Our time at Alex flat was our first airbnb experience and I have to stay, he set the bar pretty high for any future bookings.

Alex was the perfect host, we even went out together one night, which was pretty cool. He gave us some good tips how to get around in Stockholm and what to see.

As you might noticed, i'm no man of many (Website hidden by Airbnb) i'm going to make this as short as possible:

If we are going to visit Stockholm again, we would definitely stay at Alex's flat again."
9190,1231897,49136500,2015-10-01,42488222,Samuel,"First, thanks Alex for the great time up in Stockholm.
I had my first experience with airbnb and it was much better than I thought and I stay for most probably 4 weeks. Alex's apartment is clean and cozy, near to the subway and the forest (great area with a small lake an beautiful trails for a run or a walk).
As host, alex made his best to feel like home and also give you tips what you can or must see in this beautiful city. He also take the time and will explain you how it works with other things in sweden, how the life goes on in sweden, how you get from A to B and witch is the easiest way to find the appartement or other things."

Alex is very helpful and accommodating. The apartment is just 5 mins walk to the t-bana station and another 15-20 mins to the center of stockholm. Very convenient and highly recommended.

9194,1231897,78670587,2016-06-08,53220437,Bradley,"Staying at Alexander's was terrific. I was supposed to stay at a hostel in Skarpnäck but the place was strange and uncomfortable (don't stay there!) and I was desperate to find a place completely last minute. Alexander got back to immediately and accepted my booking request. His place was in a much better part of town, it was a nice apartment with a large private room. Plus, Alexander is a terrific host. Super nice guy and very accommodating. We had great weather and so we went shopping for groceries and had a cookout. We hung out and watched a movie, so enjoying yourself in Stockholm can be where you stay. It was a great way to spend my last 5 days in Sweden. 

In a few minutes, you can be at a supermarket and the metro, and in less than 20 minutes, you'll be in the city center. I can't recommend Alexander highly enough. I'd definitely stay there again the next time I'm in Sweden. "

9208,1231897,460093308,2019-05-28,16541500,Raghu,"Alexander is a thoughtful, kind and accommodating host. He tries hard to make your stay comfortable. He met my wife and I in front of his house when we arrived, and escorted us into his building. We had made the reservation rather last minute, so he had to scramble to get the place ready, but he was good spirited about it. He gave us tips about local transportation and grocery stores. 

His place is extremely conveniently located to the subway and grocery stores - both just a 6 min walk away. It's also a very safe and residential neighborhood. Our plans changed last minute so we had to cut short our stay, and he was very understanding about that too.

All in all its a great place for someone who wants a no-frills, no-fuss, convenient location to commute to Stockholm City, or to chill out."
9209,1231897,469269711,2019-06-14,9414857,Niklas,"Alex is a great host. He was very easy with my late check-in, made me feel welcome from the first minute and was easy to approach regarding all kinds of questions. I slept very well in the bed and enjoyed the quiet and friendly neighboorhood (a lot of families). Metro to the centre is just 2 minutes away, takes around 15 minutes to the central station."

It was a pleasant place to stay, sleep and relax. 
Located just around the corner of a wonderful green park, the neighborhood is very quiet and safe, 3 minutes walking from metro lines, different buses and shops too; very easy to reach quickly Central station, Nybroplan, Södermalm or other main spots, day and night.  
Five minutes walking from Nörr Mälarstrand, a beautiful walk by the sea with few pretty summer restaurants all along the way, spotting lovely views on the city. We did not meet Nathalie but she left us helpful suggestions to see and do in Stockholm.  
We just enjoyed our sunny swedish holidays.
Great end of summer for you Nathalie !"
9216,1234109,6444133,2013-08-12,4331420,Liset,"We had a great time at Nathalie's apartment. It is located in a very nice area, close to all parts of Stockholm and if you want to go further, you can easily take the metro. The supermarket around the corner is supergood and there's a park nearby. Nathalie gave us some maps and suggestions to do in Stockholm. 

The apartment is very nice, it matches the pictures perfectly. My boyfriend and I slept in the bedroom and my boyfriends brother on the comfortable couch. There were no curtains in the livingroom but he was OK with that. 

We had a very nice summer vacation in Stockholm and I would definitely recommend Nathalie's apartment!"

This is a really comfortable and cozy place only 1min walk from  Fridhelmsplan tunnelbaba with fantastic neighborhood, very close to Stockholm city center. Evertything is the same as on photos. The only one small inconvenience for me was the absence of a kettle and a microwave, but on the other hand a have had a chance to improve my cooking skills =))
Nathalie was helpfull and friendly, described everything with detailes and answered all my questions. So I can recommend her for sure!
Great choice!"

You can walk there easily in 20 min if you don't want to take a bus or subway.  The apartment is right above a COOP (grocery store) so you can easily get supplies for meals or whatever you may need.  There is no cable TV or internet so bring DVD's to watch if you want.  If you need wifi you have to walk to a 7-11 or cafe.  "

It is spacious, comfortable, and well equipped, and we enjoyed watching a DVD every night while lying in bed!

Location is great, only a short walk from everything. Even though you can walk pretty much everywhere in Stockholm, if you want to take the metro, the station is only a 3 minute walk away. The area, Kungsholmen, is mostly residential but has lots of restaurants and cafes. The pizza place on the corner is very good, and very reasonably priced. There is a supermarket around the corner as well. We were very happy with the location.

The shower was a little bit annoying as there is nowhere to hang up the nozzle, but it is no problem if you want a bath. Also, the bed is actually two single mattresses side by side, which was a little drawback, but both of these things are pretty minor. All in all we would definitely recommend this place!"

Supermarket, shops, a park and subway-station are within a short walking distance. Nathalie is a super-nice person and great host. Checking in occasionally to see if there's anything you need.

9246,1234960,20376952,2014-09-28,8941325,Pavel,"Jacob is the best host you can ever find. He did everything to make sure that our stay is as good as possible. He bought food for us, so we could have great breakfast. 
The apartment is very comfortable and cleaned. It was my first time in Stockholm and I loved is so much partly because of the great house we lived in. 
If I could characterize Jacob and his apartment in 3 tags, i would use: comfort, friendship, care "
9247,1234960,21100545,2014-10-11,21903876,Ola,Bra för flera. Trevlig och schysst värd. Lungt område. 5 min till globen. 
9248,1234960,21584915,2014-10-20,8527407,Ulrik,"We enjoyed 3 days in Jacob's house. Its a great place for relaxing and still close enough to Stockholm centre. 
Jacob gave us all the service we needed.
A great place for a family gathering or few friends."
9249,1234960,26737914,2015-02-18,17560331,Dieuwertje,"Hi Jacob, 

We had an amazing time in Stockholm! Your house was wonderful and cozy but you as a personal guide was truly fantastic!!

All the things we did, like exploring the city and visiting an IceHockey game, was in reach of your house. 

So we want to thank you again for having us. Maybe we will meet again anywhere in the future.

Greetings,

Jeroen, Dieuwertje, Wil and Martine"
9250,1234960,31773295,2015-05-10,28038187,Elieke,"The house was clean has been a real home for our one week instant family. The facilities are good, we loved the trampoline and sauna, the neighborhood is quiet and friendly and the house is close to the tunelbana (underground). The host was friendly, very welcoming and helpful in arranging things for us to make us feel welcome and at home, not only in his house but also in Stockholm. When we had a question he always answered very fast. When he wanted to get something from his house he always asked in advance whether it was ok for him to pass by to get his things.
If we could, we would have stayed much longer :-)
Angelika, Anja, Nina and Elieke"
9251,1234960,32234238,2015-05-16,8219142,Andrew,"Jacob was a fantastic host and definitely made our stay in Stockholm a very pleasant experience.  He not only left us food for breakfast but also dropped off extra bread and things for lunch on our second day there.  Jacob answered messages very quickly and was available on his phone whenever we needed.  The house was perfect for our 6 people with a great location only a 5 minute walk from subway, sauna for after long days of walking and comfortable for sleeping.  I would highly recommend Jacob and his place for anyone going to Stockholm and would definitely stay here when we return. "
9252,1234960,34034780,2015-06-03,3987045,Christine,"We had the most wonderful stay in Stockholm!  Not only was the house perfect for our party of 6 but Jacob went out of his way to make the entire experience EXCELLENT!  The house was clean, warm, comfortable and close to the train so easy to get to downtown. He had breakfast for the first day in the house for us and dropped off umbrellas, coffee and a pastry on the second day.  Totally worth being outside of the Sentrum for the lovely Swedish hospitality!  Highly recommended!  "
9253,1234960,34430121,2015-06-08,5930497,Vidya,We had a very nice stay at Jacobs place
9254,1234960,37171951,2015-07-05,33844226,Anne,"Nous avons passé un excellent séjour, la maison est très agréable, calme et située dans un quartier résidentiel, c'est la campagne à la ville...Tous les jours nous avons eu la chance de voir une biche dans la jardin ! La maison est proche du métro et d'un supermarché ce qui est très pratique. Jacob fait en sorte que l'on se sente comme chez soi, et donne tous les conseils nécessaires pour passer des vacances parfaites. Nous n'hésiterons pas à revenir chez Jacob,  en hiver ,par exemple, pour découvrir la ville dans un contexte différent. Nous recommandons chaudement la maison de Jacob à tous ceux qui veulent découvrir Stockholm. Il est un hôte parfait, très attentionné."
9255,1234960,41914075,2015-08-10,22943007,Judith,Fantastic welcome from Jacob. He was very attentive to the needs of his guests. Great house in a great location close to the Metro and supermarket. Thoroughly enjoy the welcome pack - nice touch. Interesting house with an added bonus (sauna). 
9256,1234960,43600354,2015-08-21,25252984,Marcus,"This is a really relaxed place to stay with an efficient and welcoming host. There are lots of little touches that make you feel very much at home. The house is really easy to find and is in a very quiet area yet very close to the centre of Stockholm either by public transport or by driving (if you are used to driving in a major city, Stockholm is no problem). When we arrived, there were deer in the garden; yes this really is a green area. 

We love the use of colour in the house. Breakfast in the fridge was a welcome touch."
9257,1234960,44296334,2015-08-25,33016303,Jörg,"Jacob is a great host and a great guy. He was helpful and hospitable in every possible way and did everything to make our stay as enjoyable as possible - including caring for food and drinks as well as giving great suggestions where to spend time and what to do in Stockholm. We felt very welcome and truly had the impression that Jacos is genuinely interested in the people he hosts. Short: Jacob is a host extraordinare ;-)  
The house is very convienently located. Public transportation is a mere 5 minutes walk away, getting to the buzzing areas of Stockholm, such as Södermalm only takes a couple of minutes. Same applies to a large convenience store, bakery, restaurants etc.
Despite the central location, the environment is very quiet, We even had deer in the garden at multiple occasions (much to the enjoyment of our kids).
The house and its equipment is very much as described and shown in the pictures. We had a great, relaxed stay at Jacob's house!"
9258,1234960,45547739,2015-09-04,3455456,Indrikis,The host canceled this reservation 16 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
9259,1234960,48923687,2015-09-29,8218422,Marte & Ard,"Our stay at Jacob's house was great. It is located in a quiet neighbourhood and for us it was the best retreat after a long day. Jacob was a perfect host. We could reach him easily and he was super helpful. The house has a lot of space, so for the 5 of us it was extremely comfy. We would definitely recommend this place and we would stay here again when we visit Stockholm!"
9260,1234960,63479551,2016-02-23,55950487,Dina,"Jacob was extremely welcoming and hospitable. He had provisions at the house when we arrived to eat and came by to give us a tour of the house.

His house is very cosy and comfortable and had everything we could possibly need. We even saw deer in the garden which my two young boys loved!

Thank you, Jacob for a wonderful stay. We would love to stay at yours again next time we visit Stockholm."
9261,1234960,67559819,2016-03-30,39343863,Therese,"Vi hadde en kjempefin påske i Stockholm og er veldig fornøyd med oppholdet hos Jacob. Super beliggenhet, koselig hjem, barnevennlig, rent og pent. Vi hilste på Jacob da vi kom. Han møtte oss ved t-banen og fulgte oss hjem. Vi kan absolutt anbefale et opphold hos han. "
9262,1234960,68094374,2016-04-02,50443376,Angela,"My friends and I had a great time staying in Stockholm. Jacob's house is a lovely place to stay in and Jacob was a great host, answering any questions we had. The transport links into the centre are also good and reliable. We would happily stay there again."
9263,1234960,72282130,2016-05-01,61529042,Tom,"Jacob made us feel very welcome in his house, with generous breakfast provisions and great tips on what to do around Stockholm. He went out of his way to organise bicycles for our party and always responded promptly to questions. The house is clean and airy and has a lovely garden - we had a very pleasant evening chatting around his garden table under the starlight. The location is green, with forest nearby, and a good train connection to the city centre. To be honest, it made me want to move to Stockholm."
9264,1234960,73877288,2016-05-11,19404550,Andrew,"Thank you Jacob for letting us stay at your lovely home. Right from the start we had great communication - Jacob is super-fast at responding to questions and provides clear information - and we already felt very welcome and that he was someone we could trust. The house is very homely - has everthing and more that you could want on holiday, a home from home, and we were very comfortable indeed. The open-plan living room/dining room/kitchen is a really nice large space and gets so much sun and warmth. The house is in a very quiet street just a 5 minute walk from the railway station (which is only 10 minutes or so from Stockhom Centralen and only 2 stops from the Ericsson Globe) - we saw a couple of deer in the garden one morning during our stay. There is a good supermarket just across the road from the train station if you want to pick up anything for cooking 'at home'. Jacob is a genuine chap and very generous, providing breakfast and provisions - he was also kind enough to find an extra bike for our stay, thanks for that Jacob. We would be very happy to stay at this accommodation if we visit Stockholm again."
9265,1234960,74421578,2016-05-15,5677595,Jose Roberto,"Our stay at Jacob's house was just perfect!
The house is located only 5 minutes away from the metro station and a grocery store, 15 minutes away by metro from the city centre, making it very convenient to be close to everything but also enjoy some relax away from the city. 
Jacob was very welcoming and picked us up at the metro station, gave us some tips of what to do in Stockholm and made some coffee and bought us some bread and pastry, which was very kind of him.
House is just great, huge spaces, comfortable beds and sofas and even a Sauna!! Did not try it, so I'll have to go back for that ;-) The best is the garden, ideal to have a nice coffee on a sunny morning.
Definitely recommended!!!!"
9266,1234960,76905812,2016-05-29,48145708,Lori,"We loved staying at Jacob's house! It was very clean and comfortable with plenty of room for my family (3 kids & 2 adults)
Jacob made sure we knew how all the appliances worked and even served us the best cinnamon rolls we have ever had upon our arrival. 
The neighborhood was perfect! Very close to Stockholm by Tbana but quiet with lots of green space. Also loved the grocery store just a short walk away. We would definitely stay at Jacob's again on a return trip. It was perfect!!"
9267,1234960,82645129,2016-06-28,36752405,Merissa,"Jacob is a fantastic host. Offered recommendations, provided food in the fridge, great with communication prior and throughout our stay. His house is charming. We usually love to be on the go but his place was so inviting we stayed at the house a bit more than usual. It was easy to save $ on breakfast by cooking at home. For location- I liked not staying in the main area of Stockholm. His house is a five minute walk to the metro and @ a 10 minute ride into the city. His house is a five minute walk to a grocery and a few resturants. It is residential. We have 7 year old kids who loved having their own spaces and a trampoline. "
9268,1234960,84116270,2016-07-05,54795128,Phil,"Jacob went above and beyond the expected duties of a host, leaving the fridge very well-stocked of goodies for us and even going as far as lending me his suit and shoes for a wedding. His house is spacious and is true to the pictures. It's both convenient to the city with a short walk to the station and in a quiet residential area. Our daughter loved the trampoline and the visiting deer. "
9269,1234960,89932844,2016-07-30,7538323,Annabel,"We've had a wonderfull time at Jacob's house. It's very nice and cosy and the garden is great to spend summer evenings. The location is also perfect: Stockholm is just a 15 minute drive away and when you are done discovering this wonderfull city you can relax in the very quiet neighbourhood around the house. The contact with Jacob went really well, he made sure to check in with us and did everything in his possibilities to make us feel at home, he is a great host. We were there with our 11 month year old baby, but with an open stair nearby it was a bit of a hassle sometimes, but that's what happens when you have a baby. All in all we've had a great time here and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to visit Stockholm!"
9270,1234960,91999605,2016-08-07,81948985,Ignacio," Great location, very close (5 min walk) to metro station and to city centre. Comfortable house with nice and wide garden and rooms in a remarkably quiet neighborhood. Jacob is a fantastic host and he gave us some tips for our stay, like a lovely restaurant in the city centre specialised on traditional food or good places to have a bath."
9271,1234960,105310051,2016-10-01,93972868,Sara,Kjempebra opplevelse! Jacob var kjempehyggelig og huset og hagen var enda finere enn på bildene! :) Vi kommer gjerne tilbake!

9275,1234960,161987030,2017-06-19,68204296,Christian,"Abbiamo davvero apprezzato il soggiorno in casa di Jacob, un angolo di verde e tranquillità a pochi passi dal centro di Stoccolma. "
9276,1234960,162924763,2017-06-23,81194024,Reg,"Pros: Jacob is excellent, friendly host.  Wanted to please, and brought us nice bottle of wine, coffee, extra toilet paper, etc.  House is in great location, only 10 minutes walk to subway station.  Setting is nice, and we enjoyed seeing deer frolic in yard. Main floor is nice, open, well-lighted and comfortable.
Cons: Biggest con for seniors is steep, circular, narrow staircase Up/Down to access Bedrooms. Some things are well used (pots/pans/ovens) and need a more thorough cleaning, or replace. Cupboards should be better organized/less cluttered (for neat freaks like us :-)"
9277,1234960,165921895,2017-07-02,2582702,Harris,"We had a wonderful stay here. The kids had a great time on the trampoline, we all made a nice fire outside and roasted marshmallows ... well equipped, comfy beds, hot shower, and a sauna!"

Jacob was a wonderful host and paid attention to every detail to ensure that we had a really wonderful stay. His home is stylish but cosy and had everything we needed. His home is within easy access of shops and the city centre. Highly recommend!!

Very good location, 5-10mins walk from Svedmyra metro station. 

Very homely and also super close to a very nice supermarket!"
9283,1234960,259970967,2018-05-03,13546062,Jared,"Jacob’s place is a great find. It’s located a quick twenty minutes metro ride from
the city center and only a few minutes walk from the nearest metro station. His home is large, clean, and great for groups of friends or a family. It even has a sauna!"
9284,1234960,274990064,2018-06-10,150496526,Noelle,"Jacob is very nice and easy to work with. There is no door on the downstairs bedroom, which for some families may not be a big deal, but when you are traveling with friends or people you aren’t related to, it can be a bit odd. Other than that, the house was easy to get to by public transit and Jacob was very accommodating."
9285,1234960,277991714,2018-06-17,36542210,Jessica,"A real swedish experience! We had a wonderful stay at Jacobs house, which is situated in a calm neighborhood, very close to Gamla Sta & Södermalm.
The house has a great charm and the sauna, fireplace, big garden and nice lighting adds to the experience. We even saw deer in the garden! 
Jacob is very nice and was very responsive, he did everything to make our stay great."
9286,1234960,284820578,2018-07-02,162072959,Stéphane,"Notre séjour en Suède était franchement excellent. Nous sommes restés 12 jours. La maison de Jacob, située dans un quartier résidentiel, est très calme et agréable avec sa grande pièce de vie lumineuse. Le métro n'est pas très loin (5 minutes à pied max) et nous permet de rejoindre facilement le centre de Stockholm en 15 minutes environ. A côté du métro il y a un supermarché ICA qui est bien pratique pour les courses du quotidien. Jacob est un hôte formidable. Il fait en sorte que nous nous sentions comme chez soi. Il est très réactif aux sollicitations par sms ou téléphone. Il ne se passait pas un jour sans qu'il nous communique une adresse pour déjeuner, diner, boire un verre ou nous conseille un endroit à découvrir (nous avons adoré l'île de Sandhamn, Hellas Garden...). Il est vraiment attentionné et fait preuve d'une grande gentillesse. Bref que dire de plus sinon que nous n'hésiterons pas à revenir chez Jacob… et pourquoi pas en hiver la prochaine fois. MERCI BEAUCOUP JACOB ET SOPHIE. A BIENTOT. Stéphane."
9287,1234960,292977668,2018-07-19,5980640,Susan,"Jacob’s place is in a residential area but easily accessible from the centre of the city. The house has generous living, dining and kitchen areas and was very comfortable for our family of six. The downstairs double bedroom had its own bathroom which meant it was almost like a private wing which was useful for the older couple in our extended family."

The area was perfect for our little family with the tube and super market just a short walk away and the lovely coffee shop Enskedeparkens bageri around the corner. 
Jacob was a great host, very flexible and attentive with speedy and friendly replies to any and all questions. 
I am happy to recommend this place to anyone."

We didn't have time to use the sauna but we jumped on the trampoline and felt like kids again. Jacob allowed us to use anything we wished for. It was a last minute booking but Jacob managed to be very accommodating and friendly. Sadly we only stayed for one night but we would definitely like to come back for a few more days next time. Thank you Jacob!"

9300,1243144,5989056,2013-07-25,7153561,Nina Jagd,Our family of four had a wonderful time in this charming apartment. The location was perfect for exploring the city and the neighbourhood was lovely. An was an extraordinarily helpful and friendly host and we highly recommend her place.
9301,1243144,6107395,2013-07-30,6592314,Eric,Great place to stay if visiting Stockholm.  We stayed 3 nights and managed to explore different parts of of the city from this location.  It is just south of the old town (walking distance) and a metro station is in the neighbourhood.   The apartment is very attractive and comfortable.  Definitely recommend it.
9302,1243144,6220733,2013-08-04,1654534,Rahel,"Thanks a lot to Anikka, everything has been very nice and clean. The appartement was just closed to all the sights in Stockholm. An`s Dad did give us a warm welcome and it was great to come ""home"" after a long journey to such a lovely appartement. Nothing was missing and we spent 4 great days in Stockholm, anytime again! 
"
9303,1243144,7455496,2013-09-21,4748401,Garry,"We felt extremely lucky to stay in such a great apartment in a fantastic location.  Looking out the window you could see up and down Hornsgatan, and you knew you were somewhere special.  
We were at the northern end of Sodermalm, a short walk from Gamla Stan and very close to the Mariatorget tunnelbana.  
The apartment had a large living area (where someone could sleep if required) as well as two separate bedrooms, so there was a lot of room.  The bathroom is small but who cares?  Annika left coffee and other condiments for our use which was appreciated. Checking in and out was easy as Annika's Dad lives close by.  
Staying at Annika's made us feel very Swedish for a few days!"

The apartment is so nice, big rooms, quiet, comfortable and in a great location.
I couldn't have wished for a better place to spend two weeks in Stockholm."

Very nice apartment in an attractive  part of Stockholm. Cozy, lot's of light and comfortable beds. All very clean. We had a great week. The hostess is very nice and helpful! Highly recommended. "
9306,1244357,7164743,2013-09-09,298485,Chris,"The location is excellent! It's 1 block away from a Hard Rock Cafe, which should tell you something about it's location. Apartment is as described in the photos, very well organized and efficient, everything here is from IKEA. My mom and sister stayed here and Elliot was nice enough to get 2 new single mattresses for me to sleep on the floor with. This place could sleep up to 5 people (with two persons in the main bedroom), although I would say it would be too crowded to have over 4 people in this apartment.

It also has a nice 42"" flatscreen TV you can plug your laptop into. A note about the WIFI, Elliot took me immediately to a place where I got a USB 3G stick and it was pretty cheap, you get 5GB for about $14US, and the stick is another $14 or so."
9307,1244357,87906707,2016-07-22,23229054,Denise,"The apartment is well located, near a wonderful park and the communication with Elliot was easy and helpful."
9308,1244357,91534184,2016-08-05,15648547,Björn,"Elliotts appartment was a great stay for us. A great location within Stockholm, with a subway station in walking distance and also up to 7 different bus lines. We found the apartment very clean and with instructions on everything we needed to know from it (and also recommendations for our stay in Stockholm). We weren’t able to meet Elliott, but communication with him was very easy, and he was answering right away when we had some question. You won’t regret staying in Elliotts apartment when coming to Stockholm."
9309,1244357,97217008,2016-08-26,71337486,Rafi,"I only have good things to say about Elliott and Rebecca's apartment and the services they provide.
The property is exactly as it looked in the listing. It is not a lrage apartment but we knew that coming in. Elliott provided us with 2 comfortable floor mattresses for our children and they were quite happy with them.
They gave us a very detailed instruction booklet with everything we needed to know about the apartment itself, plus a comprehensive guide about the area and accessibility to the city. The location is great. Just outside the city centre with trains and busses making it easy to get to.
We had a car for part of the time and parking wasn't the easiest experience. I noticed before our arrival that there is a Avis/Budget office in the building next door so i booked our rental car from them which made it easy to pick up and return.
All in all we had a great trip!"
9310,1244357,99037890,2016-09-03,18169832,Ross,"Elliott's place is perfectly located—downtown but with calmer traffic.  His apartment- and area-guide was comprehensive and full of useful details that made arrival easy.

Tack så mycket, Elliott och Rebecca!"
9311,1244357,99847063,2016-09-06,4756278,Bernice,"Excellent apartment in a very central location, exactly as described and very clean! Elliott was very helpful and prompt in communication. "

9314,1244357,125124814,2017-01-04,36693122,Наталья,"Квартира располагалась в чудесном, тихом и уютном районе, но в то же время было совсем недалеко ехать на метро до центра, буквально 2 станции. Мы не испытывали никаких затруднений с проживанием (включая check-in in и check-out, магазины, рестораны и т.д.). Фотографии полностью соответствовали действительности, было все необходимое и, что не мало важно, приятная атмосфера в квартире! Очень рекомендую, соотношение цена-качество-месторасположение складывается удачно."

The apartment was very conveniently located close to public transport, as well as some nice restaurants and parks. Would definitely recommend staying here! "

They were incredible hosts, informative, responsive and very generous with advice and guidance. I heartily recommend s their apartment as a place to stay in Stockholm."
9318,1244357,182239948,2017-08-14,111586916,Elizabeth,"This is a lovely apartment. It is decorated really well and is comfortable and very stylish. The location is very convenient for transport and there are plenty of local bakeries, coffee shops and bars. Elliot was extremely helpful and communication was great. We would highly recommend this apartment for anyone visiting Stockholm and looking for a quiet, stylish and very  pleasant place to stay."
9319,1244357,187542698,2017-08-27,1567332,Hanna,"We had a lovely stay at Elliot's place. It had everything that you needed.
Well equipped kitchen and if you are a coffee lover, you will get a bonus as they have various coffee machines to play with.
Very clean and comfortable 
Easy access to stores and coffee places 
Excellent communication with the host
Good transportation 
There is an AMAZING large park close by that I went jogging to at early am. Surprisingly there are not too many joggers or maybe I was just there too early. 

I would for sure consider this place again I am in Sweden."
9320,1244357,450380456,2019-05-09,107804816,Andrey,"Мы с женой и нашим ребёнком останавливались в этой квартире во время нашего пребывания в Стокгольме на неделю. Квартира очень чистая, мебель новая, санузел в прекрасном состоянии. Порадовала также продуманность бытовых мелочей: полотенца, посуда, необходимые для готовки специи, соусы и тд. Всё это предоставлено в большом количестве. Если выйти из дома и повернуть направо, в трёх минутах ходьбы есть отличная детская площадка в парке. Поэтому проблем с тем, где погулять вечером с ребёнком, также не возникало. Там же находится пункт раздельного сбора мусора. Локация: до метро идти около 3-5 минут. Пешком до станции T centralen около 15-20 минут. Мы любим гулять и ходили пешком в музей Васа и Юнибакен, это занимало около 40 минут. Если вы любите бегать, то рекомендовал бы парк рядом с музеем Васа, до него около 3 километров от дома. Для ребёнка в квартире комфортные условия, единственно нет детской кроватки (это хозяева сообщили заранее, поэтому неприятных неожиданностей не было). Поэтому я спал в гостиной, так как втроём спать на одной кровати было бы неудобно. Я однозначно рекомендую данное жильё, оно полностью соответствует описанию, очень чистое и абсолютно новое."
9321,1244357,463345947,2019-06-03,175775889,Simon,Good location and comfortable apartment for a great trip to Stockholm
9322,1244357,483117254,2019-07-07,13522310,Dan,"My parents and I had a great time at Elliott and Rebecca’s flat. My parents are a bit older so that it is on the first floor is much appreciated as they have had trouble with stairs in other buildings in Stockholm in the past. The location is great, the flat had everything we needed, and checkin and checkout was made very easy! Thanks for having us."
9323,1244657,5802207,2013-07-16,4796198,Jose Luis,"Nic and Usha's place is the perfect location if you want to be in the middle of it all. Just a stone away from Galam Stan in the Södermalm district, the apartment is very close to the best coffee shops, bakeries, grocery stores, bars, clubs, designer and second hand shops in Stockholm. Despite its central location the flat remains quiet, there is a small inner open courtyard in the middle of the building in which I could lounge. 
The apartment is in a historic building which has been tastefully revamped to modern times. The Swedish painter Anders Zorn (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) had his studio in the attic, I had never heard of him until my visit to Stockholm and I was happily surprised when I saw several of his painting hung on the walls of the National Museum of Art! 
Nic replied to my request quickly and was extremely accommodating even though he was abroad! A competitive price, great location, and caring host makes this apartment the best stay in Stockholm, I would definitely return. "
9324,1244657,5974274,2013-07-24,1267277,Stefano,"Nic&Usha's house is a perfect place to stay. They have been very quick in replying to every question. Arriving there has been very easy and you can choose to go on foot from the central station or by t-bana. Even if they were abroad everything has worked perfectly. The room is a very comfortable and quiet one with a well-functioning wireless. You are near the old town Gamla-stan or the Sodermalm neighbourhood with its cafe'. If you like cycling you can use the air compressor  in front of the building :-). And if you like beer, just behind the corner, there are two of the best pubs I've ever seen. Leaving the house and the town has been a bit sad! In summary, I strongly recommend Nic&Usha's house!
Cheers, stefano"

The room was big, the bed was comfortable, and I was able to use the kitchen, which was great. Biggest thing I missed was somewhere to hang my clothes - not a small detail when traveling for business. But definitely recommended overall!"

The room is larger than it looks in the photos and very cute. I'm still not over that incredible rainbow chandelier. It's also nicely situated so you feel a bit less terrible when you're dragging all of your bags to the front door at 3:30 am. I wish we'd had more time to chat! Thanks for a very comfortable stay!"

The location is perfect and very close to the main sights of Stockholm. Stockholm is walkable, so it's easy to get to anywhere within 30 minutes. The port to boat rides is 5 minutes from the flat.
Thank you Nic & Usha. Hope to see you again when I return to Stockholm. :-D"
9333,1244657,76315405,2016-05-26,7579230,Yen,"I had an incredible and unforgettable time in Stockholm thanks to Nic and Usha.  Their place is incredibly convenient to public transportation and major attractions; inside, it is very clean and really artsy-funky.  The room is also beautiful and clean and gets lots of great light from the window.  

Nic and Usha were also the perfect hosts--extremely kind, welcoming, and helpful.  When I arrived, they showed me where the public transportation was and pointed out places I could walk to, even offering for me to join them on their walk.  The next day was Sunday, and they invited me to a lovely breakfast and told me about things that were happening around the city.  I didn't see them very much as I was usually out and about, but I definitely, absolutely recommend Nic and Usha.  I'm already thinking of when I can go back!"

Even though I arrived very late at night, Nic waited up to let me in and show me everything. The flat is in a perfect location for visiting Stockholm, and the space is comfortable and large enough for a single traveler. Wifi and working space was also good for the times I needed to log on to work. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Stockholm. Nic and Usha, thanks so much and enjoy all of your summer travels!"

As advertised, the bed is very comfortable- esp. after a long journey. The shared bathroom is clean, hot shower, etc. The location can't be beat (just over the walking bridge from Gamla Stan/Old Town in Sodermalm). 

Perfect for a single traveler and made my stay in Stockholm so enjoyable. 
Thanks again, Nic and Usha, and may our paths cross again!"

Nic and Usha are lovely people: very helpful and friendly. Nic even made time to walk me to the metro stop the day I was leaving and help me get a ticket. 

The bed was very comfortable, and it was surprisingly quiet outside given their location. I was able to sleep with the windows open all night, which was quite nice.

I happily recommend this place to others, and will gladly stay here again."

9441,1248490,71167822,2016-04-24,58732285,Rocio,"El apartamento está fenomenal, muy amplio, limpio y cómodo. Dormimos 5 personas de forma cómoda. Está situado en pleno barrio de Söderman, con muchas tiendas y locales modernos cerca para tomar algo, pero a la vez la zona es muy tranquila. A unos 5-10 min. andando al metro y a unos 35-45 min. andando del centro.
La anfitriona, María, fue muy flexible y nos dió facilidades para dejarnos las llaves, ya que llegamos muy tarde Estocolmo."
9442,1248490,73561240,2016-05-08,13446501,Glykeria,"Thanks to Maria We had a perfect stay at Stockholm ! The flat is absolutely great with everything someone needs to feel at home! :) 
5 stars *****"
9443,1248490,74515830,2016-05-15,13920386,David,"Maria was extremely welcoming and took the time to show us around the flat, point out some of the amazing things to do in Stockholm and impress upon us that she was always available by text if we had any queries.  In fact she went beyond the call of duty by texting us some bar choices! Excellent host!"
9444,1248490,75705918,2016-05-22,11268207,Anne Hyldal,"Jeg, med to søstre og mor, boede i Marias særdeles dejlige lejlighed maj 2016. Før ankomst: Maria svarer hurtigt og positivt tilbage på alle henvendelser. Ved ankomst: Vores fly fra Danmark var meget forsinket - og Maria var hjælpsom og meget forstående i denne forbindelse. Lejligheden: En særdeles flot og ren lejlighed - her mangler intet. Heller ikke ro eller lys! Området: Lejligheden ligger lige midt i skønne Södermalm  - og ikke mindst 5 etager over god indisk restaurant. Jeg kan kun anbefale Maria , som værtinde i denne lejlighed!"
9445,1248490,78453881,2016-06-06,49629307,Pascal,"Merci Maria pour votre accueil et vos conseils.

9447,1248490,81701045,2016-06-24,1775328,Cindy,"Thanks Maria for letting us stay in your comfortable home. Everything was what we expected
There were 6 of us in the apartment and we had plenty of space. We ate twice at Shanti. Very good Indian food. We played cards at Brewdog. We watched Sweden play soccer at Brickyard. And enjoyed a vegan smorgasbord at Hermans.
The walk along Katarina Bangata was a beautiful tree lined stroll. 
We walked most places and found being in this location very nice. The T was close too.... About 10 minutes walk

Thank you Maria"
9448,1248490,83419201,2016-07-02,10119316,Philipp,"Everything was just great: the appartment is cozy and beautiful, and it is perfectly well located. Maria and Anna are very supportive, just perfect hosts. Highly recommended."
9449,1248490,84686301,2016-07-08,30593086,Lai Yi,Maria's home is located in a quiet and upper market area so safety is not an issue. It is also an easy walk to many supermarkets and cafes and restaurants. My family and i love the food at Shanti (Indian Restaurant downstairs) so we went twice in our 4 days of stay. The place is also clean and it was easy for us to cook our breakfast and supper. Kitchen is well equipped. We only wish it was a closer walk to the major attractions as my parents cant walk much so we called for uber. But overall we have enjoyed our stay at Maria's place. 
9450,1248490,86241762,2016-07-15,14977944,Sabine,"wunderbare ausstattung, ruhig gelegen, alles vorhanden für gelungenen aufenthalt für vier personen!"

We loved the views on all sides (the church at night!) and the neighborhood is fantastic! Good supermarket, cafés and playgrounds nearby and quick access to downtown by buss. Communication was easy and Maria responded quickly and adequately to our questions. 
Thanks!"
9452,1248490,89735500,2016-07-29,33413699,Kirsten,"Maria hat uns sehr sehr freundlich begrüßt und hat uns erzählt, was man in Stockholm alles unternehmen kann.
Die Wohnung ist sehr geschmackvoll eingerichtet und der Ausblick auf Stockholm ist sehr schön!
Die Lage ist für jegliche Unternehmungen perfekt und die Wohnung ist trotz zentraler Lage sehr ruhig.
Sehr empfehlenswert!!"
9453,1248490,93774308,2016-08-13,24061184,Sebastian,"La experiencia ha sido inmejorable, la anfitriona ha sido un encanto, con mucha y buena información y una cálida acogida. La casa es fantástica, con todo lo necesario para pasar unos días muy buenos en esa bella ciudad que es Estocolmo. La situación de la casa es muy buena, en un barrio muy tranquilo y moderno, lleno de restaurantes y tiendas muy chulas. El metro está muy cerca, pero se puede también ir andando a todos los sitios. Una fran experiencia, en definitiva."

Stock hat alles, was man braucht: eine perfekt eingerichtete Küche, zwei Schlafzimmer, zwei Bäder und ein gemütlich eingerichtetes Wohnzimmer mit Balkon und Blick auf den begrünten Innenhof. Ein zusätzliches Bett befindet sich hinter einem Raumteiler in der Wohnküche. Maria war eine exzellente Gastgeberin. Der Check-in war unproblematisch, an unserem Abreisetag duften wir sogar bis abends bleiben. Wir kommen gerne wieder."

9460,1248490,173809894,2017-07-24,11152363,Frank,"We experienced a very warm welcome to a beautiful, cosy and very comfortable appartment which is situtated in one of Stockholm's most beautiful and hip areas - full of very nice restaurants and bars. Nevertheless, the neighborhood is calm and offers a lot of green spots, even if the city centre is in walking distance. Probably one of the best adresses to be in Sweden's capital!"
9461,1248490,179220145,2017-08-07,57847572,Nicole,Schoon en gezellig appartement in rustige buurt met veel cafés en restaurants. Goede verbinding met openbaar vervoer naar stadscentrum Stockholm. Maria is erg vriendelijk en behulpzaam. Heerlijke dagen gehad
9462,1248490,271704009,2018-06-02,25609275,Ross,"You will be pleased with the apartment, very high end.  Maria was awesome too!"
9463,1248490,280363866,2018-06-23,125038997,Andrea,Marias apartment is situated very nicely on Sodermalm. It was very easy to use public transport (both bus and train) into central Stockholm and is located in a nice residential area with lots of restaurants and shops. Maria was easy to communicate with and was at her apartment to greet us upon arrival. I wholeheartedly recommend!
9464,1248490,295214195,2018-07-23,34952486,Bill,"If you are going to Stockholm, staying in Sodermalm is a must, great vibe great eats and easy transportation to major sites of Stockholm.  Quite affordable real local feel, kinda like Brownsville, the village of nyc."
9465,1248490,441925674,2019-04-22,118241446,Sigrid,"Eine schöne Wohnung, tolle Lage, tolle Ausstattung. Wir haben wunderschöne Tage in Stockholm verbracht. Jederzeit wieder."
9466,1248490,448353763,2019-05-05,49103380,Robert,Maria and Anna are amazing hosts and made sure we had everything we needed! Loved our stay here and they even acommodated to our flight schedules. Would definitely stay here again.
9467,1248490,454377843,2019-05-18,229444247,Alexandre,"We spent 6 wonderful days in Stockholm, and it was the best accommodation in my life. When I was choosing the flat to stay in the city, I looked through more than 100 variants and I'm so glad to find Maria's apartment. 
For me and my family the most important criteria were quiet nearby and convenient location. So, the surroundings are very calm and the location is really unbelievable. 
About 10 minutes to get to Skanstull underground station, 4 minutes to get to Gotlandsgatan or Södermannangatan busstops, 5 minutes - Ljusterögatan busstop, from where it's so easy to go to Slussen, Gamla Stan, Odenplan, Ropsten, T-Centralen... and wherever you need. 
5 minutes to get to Coop supermarket.
2 parks are so close if you want to take a walk. 
And many cafes and shops nearby! 
People who like walking can easily get to the centre (Gamla Stan) without public transport: it'll take about 25 minutes on foot. 
For us it was also convenient because we arrived in Stockholm by Viking Line ferry (20-25 minutes by bus with 1 change). 
The flat. It's very cosy, comfortable, beautiful, stylish and spacious! 2 toilets, pretty balcony, well-equipped kitchen with fridge full of tasty sauces, jams and whatever (Maria let us take everything from the fridge). We mostly cooked ourselves, and it was easy and comfortable to cook porridge or pasta on the stove. The  design of the flat is wonderful. And the views are hard to describe! When you have breakfast or supper, you sit in the kitchen and admire crowns of the trees in the street, Sofia church and the park nearby, when you sit in the balcony with a cup of tea, you enjoy wonderful old roofs of the block. 
The equipment of the apartment is full, to my mind. Radio, TV set, comfortable furniture... and Wi-Fi, of course. 
Actually, everything was clean. 
As for Maria, who met us personally, I think she is the best host in my life. She is a very friendly person ready to help you in any situations. Answers to all my questions and hints were timely and useful. 
I wish we could come back once... 
I highly recommend this flat to everybody who wants to get acquainted with Stockholm."
9468,1248490,456689388,2019-05-22,23864492,Jan,"Great place to stay on walking distance of Gamla Stan, the old town. And lots of options for a meal or drink nearby. The apartment was neat and host was very flexible when we were late because of a delayed flight. We had a great time in Stockholm, also thanks to this comfortable stay."
9469,1248490,458535741,2019-05-26,8076553,Elena,"La casa di Maria è esattamente come mostrata in foto,  quello che le foto non possono  raccontare è il calore che questa casa trasmette...fare colazione davanti alla finestra con lo sguardo sui tetti e  alberi è impagabile. Una casa pulitissima, molto curata nei dettagli, comoda per 5 persone e con tutto l'occorrente visto che in realtà è una casa abitata dalla proprietaria, che è stata molto flessibile anche con il chek-out (abbiamo potuto lasciare la casa il pomeriggio dato che il volo era verso sera), inoltre ci ha lasciato le tessere da ricaricare  per i mezzi di trasporto che altrimenti avremmo dovuto acquistare...queste sono delle piccole attenzioni verso l'ospite che non trovi dappertutto, quindi grazie."
9470,1248490,463823613,2019-06-04,72307799,Adel,"Very stylish apartment, it is spacious and very comfortable.  It is very close to some great places for food, drinks, grocery shopping, cafes and even green spaces for exercise/relaxation.  You will be spoiled for choice.  
I would definitely stay there again."
9471,1248490,469692978,2019-06-15,20461922,Dieter,Die Wohnung von Maria ist super. Maria selbst ist auch sehr engagiert wenn irgendwelche Fragen auftauchen hilft sie sofort. Wir können die Wohnung nur empfehlen. Danke Maria
9472,1248490,475338228,2019-06-24,24272397,Timothy,"Maria’s home was a relaxing stay for our family.  We appreciated the elevator to the upper level apartment, that had cooling breezes between the east and west windows.
Access to the rest of Stockholm was convenient by nearby bus stops, as well as a short walk to trains.
The surrounding neighborhood had many parks and small restaurants."
9473,1248490,478803506,2019-06-30,12728549,Susanne,"We had a wonderful stay in Maria's apartment. The apartment is beautiful, spacious, well-equipped, clean and located in a beautiful and calm area of Södermalm. Everything you need is within walking distance (cafés, restaurants, supermarkets, etc.). Maria is a wonderful host. Communication was easy. She answered all our questions, provided helpful tips and was very welcoming and friendly. The apartment and Maria as a host are both highly recommended."
9474,1248490,496197919,2019-07-27,181981899,Ingrid,"Lägenheten ligger i ett av de absolut mysigaste kvarteren i Stockholm. Den är smakfullt inredd med många fina detaljer, lugn och fin, luftig och med en av de vackraste utsikterna vi varit med om. Marias mottagande vid vår ankomst var varmt och professionellt. Vi värdesätter högt hennes vänlighet, och kan varmt rekommendera lägenheten"

She is a wonderful host, always trying to help and to suggest things to do, in the city, helping with everything you may need when visting a new city. Her house is fantastic as well and you really feel confortable as you were in your home."
9477,1248490,513185030,2019-08-19,35245689,Bob,"Beautiful apartment in a great location
There are street fairs, markets and outdoor cafes right around the corner.
The Old City and many sights are within walking distance
Maria is a fantastic host.

Highly recommended."
9478,1248490,526595660,2019-09-09,240335764,Steph,This is a beautiful and surprisingly spacious apartment located in a great part of Stockholm. All six of us thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
9479,1248490,533185337,2019-09-21,60300578,Irene,"Maria是個很好的民宿主人,熱情,我們的要求全部滿足｡房間舒適清潔,設備齊全,像在家中一樣｡交通方便,食店多 ,超市近,價錢合理,3間房 ,2間洗手間,1個露台,十分滿意☺️"
9480,1250227,6597980,2013-08-18,7736330,Matthijs,"Per has a small but very pleasant apartment with a lot of character. We've stayed there with our family, two kids. The quiet street is conveniently located near a tube station. Östermalm is not as hip and happening as Södermalm, but a good base for exploring every corner of the city. We haven't met Per personally and his communication was brief but sufficient.
If you look for a fancy, super clean place on a lively and hip location, this isn't yours. If you want a cosy, quite place in a more traditional part of town without spending too much, this might be perfect for you."
9481,1250227,6973385,2013-09-01,4325568,Chiara,"Appartamento confortevole e ben arredato situato in un edificio storico in quartiere elegante e tranquillo. A due passi dalla metropolitana, dalle fermate degli autobus e dal supermercato. Tutto è stato perfetto per la nostra vacanza a Stoccolma. Noi e le nostre due bimbe abbiamo adorato la casa di Per."
9482,1250227,9798025,2014-01-11,9349929,Patricia,"Per's apartment is located in one of the most cutest street in Stockholm! Great area, beautiful surroundings. The apartment itself is decorated with style, its very functional and has everything you need for a stay in Stockholm. Per is very friendly and the communication with him was very smoothly. I highly recommend his place! We stay almost a month and we just loved it! Thanks for everything! "
9483,1250227,35213067,2015-06-16,8261960,Mikael,Fin mysig lägenhet med närhet till allt vad Stockholm har att erbjuda. Väldigt lugn och bra gata med en mycket idyllisk miljö och Per som värd har varit väldigt hjälpsam under vistelsen.
9484,1250227,43223130,2015-08-18,32711389,Barbro E,"Listing was as expected. Per was a helpful host.
The location was wonderful. Close to everything. Grocery store within
1-2 min. walk. Closest restaurant 2 min. away with many more within
walking distance.
We walked all over Stockholm. What a beautiful city!
I would stay there again if available.
WiFi was not available in the apt. but most cafes and restaurants
provided a connection. The basic four TV channels in Sweden was available.
One important issue to mention: Many people, myself included,
are allergic to down and duck feathers and I had a problem there.
We were able to do something about it ourselves, however Per
was very kind and would have done something about it had he known.
(Didn't tell him until we called to say goodbye and thank you).
We usually stay in hotels so this Airbnb was wonderful. Having a kitchen and access to laundry makes it very convenient during longer stays. 
We were there for 32-33 days."
9485,1250227,48804417,2015-09-28,43084292,Nigel,"Wonderful apartment in a lovely quiet residential area of the city. Very nicely positioned near tube station, but within walking distance of city centre. Very comfortable accommodation, looking forward to returning."
9486,1250227,52601848,2015-10-31,45054970,Fredrik,Allt fungerade mycket smidigt både före och under vistelsen. Lägenheten ligger i ett mycket trevligt område och levde helt upp till förväntningarna.
9487,1250227,56849540,2015-12-19,47077389,Isabel,"Per left me a very nice welcome note and some City guides - really appreciated that.
Location is perfect, neighbours very, very quiet.
In the page showing the appartment, Per could perhaps post pics of both kitchen and WC. This gives the People the chance to choose, with all Information on the appartment, not just the nice parts."
9488,1250227,108422232,2016-10-16,11097787,Peter,"Per was extremely professional, courteous and a great host. Even drove around making sure I was comfortable with parking situation!!!"
9489,1250227,153902510,2017-05-22,16396194,Philip,Lovely apartment less than fifteen minutes walk from Gamla Stan and even closer to Drottninggatan and Kungsgatan.  The location is perfect.  I would highly recommend Per's apartment for anyone considering a short or longer term stay in Stockholm.
9490,1250227,155110598,2017-05-27,128834147,Ulf,En perfekt lägenhet med charm och ett lugnt men ändå centralt läge. Idealiskt för ett par.
9491,1250227,159966691,2017-06-12,107192175,David,"The apartment was in a great location in Stockholm, within walking distance for me to most all the top destinations and shopping. I walked almost every day to old town or one of the other locations. The apartment is in a very picturesque part of the town. Great restaurants are nearby as well as grocery. There is a really nice park nearby too, where I went running a few times. "
9492,1250227,162033026,2017-06-19,119424865,Caroline,The apartment is very comfortable all very clean and very close to the center.thanks

9495,1250227,182170474,2017-08-14,32711389,Barbro E,"I reviewed our stay two years ago and liked our stay in the apartment just
as much this time. Quiet but very centrally located. Close to everything.
We walked everywhere. To restaurants, shopping, grocery stores, museums and the train station/ Cityterminalen. Took the commuter train to the new mall in Solna, The Mall of Scandinavia."
9496,1250227,188665894,2017-08-30,91446888,Mark,"The apartment was quite well located not far from the city centre though far enough to be quiet. 
Per was a good host and communicated well including accessing the apartment which was easy.

I just thought that I did not use a laundry and assume it was downstairs. The bed was very comfortable and the kitchen adequate for preparing breakfast which was the only meals I had there. All needs for one or a couple. Check out Rolf's Kok restaurant very good and only about one kilometre walk."
9497,1250227,246392942,2018-03-25,1397450,Radu,This is an excellent place with an excellent host. But BEWARE it does not have WIFI and this is a big problem since it is not advertised. This impacted our trip negatively and we had to go chasing around for some internet and could not have the business meetings we needed properly etc. Otherwise the host was great (SMS and call only) and would stay there again if WIFI becomes available. Otherwise I would NOT recommend this apartment.
9498,1250227,264938217,2018-05-15,54514867,Niklas,The host canceled this reservation 30 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

Really central yet very peaceful. If it is free, I would wholeheartedly recommend a stay in this apartment. Go for it! "

9501,1250227,318011477,2018-09-03,26980523,Andrew,"The apartment is in a nice part of Stockholm. Near to many amenities, but in a gorgeous, quiet street surrounded by embassies. It is a smart area and seems quite exclusive, so those seeking a more bohemian experience may be better heading for Sodermalm. 
All areas within easy walking distance though, including the old town.
Quality, comfortable accommodation, perfect for a couple hoping to explore.
Well recommended."
9502,1250227,335449345,2018-10-12,134581898,Pelle,Very fine apartment that aged nicely. Located in one of the finest streets in Stockholm. Enjoyed very much!

in the room have many knife but not confortable for using kitchen.
not far from central. because transfortation fee was very (Website hidden by Airbnb) not much good."
9508,1251466,7351476,2013-09-16,3961044,Eunyoung,"Dean and Dace were very accommodating hosts. We had a little bit of problem getting to their place but overall stay was satisfactory.
The place was cozy and clean. Close to train station and it takes about 20 minutes to the city center. We stayed at Dean's place for two nights and Dace made us fresh mint tea on arrival. Our baggage didn't make it on time and Dace and Dean helped us get luggage the next day while we were sightseeing in the city.

The only advice to the next renter is to get the exact address. Dean said that he was going to meet us at the station. our roaming phone gave us problems so we could have just walked instead of waiting for pick up if I had known the exact address."

It's worth stressing that it's good for the ones that come with a car and the ones without it. The place is 5 min from metro station and you can park your car for free next to the accommodation.

Thank you for a warm welcome and hospitality. I truly recommend this  :)"

Sergey/Alexandra"
9517,1251466,17808588,2014-08-17,19950165,Anna,"We have been at Dean's for one night. Pro: The metro is really close and with the lowest ticket fare you can reach the center of the city, in about 10-15 minutes. Dean is kind and gave us a lot of privacy. He also provided clean bed linen and large soft bathroom towels. Cons: The room was ok, a very very comfortable bed, small table, little couch and microwave+waterboiler on the ground. It is ok for a very short stay, but the price should be lower. The bathroom is small and could have been more clean, as the rest of the house. Last but not least, the pictures displayed for this flat do not much the real one."
9518,1251466,18141303,2014-08-22,17651133,Raphaela,"We stayed in Dean's appartment for two nights. The room was clean and we had a water boiler as well as a microwave which was quite useful. The metro is just around the corner and we could easily get into the city. The bathroom is a little small and not so clean and we were astonished, because the pictures in here show another room. Anyway, Dean is a nice guy and it was good to stay there for these two nights. "
9519,1251466,18456526,2014-08-26,19488808,Cédric,Dean is a really nice host. He picked us up at the metrostation despite his house is only few minutes away from it. The appartement is a bit outside of the city but with the metro you're in the city center within 20 minutes. The room was clean and the bed was confortable. The only negative point is the kitchen which is not really good equiped and a little dirty. However the overal experience was very good.

He was quick to respond and even came and picked us up from the train station (very late at night, even though he had work) after providing very good directions.  He was a very gracious host and ensured that we were well taken care of.  The room was wonderful - VERY comfy bed with lots of room!  Dean also let us leave our bags at his place for the day and come back later to pick them up.

Thank you for a wonderful time, Dean!

We would not recomend to stay there. Bathroom was not very clean and if we would have seen it before, we would probably book something different.
Address is not as written here in airbnb - the appartment is directly located at Akeshov Metro station. Also it seemed strange to us, that the host answered from a different phone number.
Most of the time the host were not in the appartment with us, so we had little interaction with him.
Kitchen is absolutly not well equiped and not than clean, that we would cook there.
I'm sorry, even if Dean (the host) was friendly and picked us from the Metro station, we would not recomend to stay there.
The central station is 22min by metro and more close to the old town takes even longer!"

Die Unterkunft liegt etwas außerhalb vom Stadtzentrum,was aber aufgrund der nur 2Min.entfernt gelegenen Metrostation kein Problem war.Innerhalb von 25Min ist man in der Altstadt Gamla Stan. Dean war ein freundlicher Gastgeber und holte uns sogar von der Metro ab und gab uns auf dem Weg zu sich ein paar Tipps,was man unternehmen könnte. Unser Zimmer war sauber und modern eingerichtet.Küche und Bad standen uns natürlich zur freien Benutzung.
Wir hatten einen angenehmen Aufenthalt bei Dean."

Nous avions tout le confort décrit dans l'annonce. Le logement est situé près d'un métro qui mène au centre en 20 minutes.

Dean was more than accommodating, even giving us some snacks after our late arrival. After following the address we were given we ended up at a house that wasn't Dean's and wasn't under any Airbnb listing. This was not helped by the fact that we couldn't contact him because there was no wifi. Once we managed to get in contact with him it was difficult to organise our meeting at the right train station. By that time it was quite late at night, but Dean picked us up from the train station and helped us with our bags which was kind of him. Despite all of the confusion we really enjoyed our stay. The apartment was a 5min walk from the train station and it took only 15min to get to the centre of Stockholm. "

There is a big double bed and even sofa which is big enough to sleep for one lady. Bathroom is clean. The location is also perfect.

The location is very close to the train which made it really easy to get into the city, and it is across from a great park/nature reserve. I jogged around the lake there most mornings which was really nice. The apartment itself is in a slightly different location than what is listed here, so be sure to communicate with Dean about how to get there. It is very similar to the photos, but with different furniture. It was not as clean as I would have expected, but it was ok, and definitely worth the price in Stockholm. Thanks Dean!"

Once arrived, we didn´t have the expected experience. The apartment was not clean(the kitchen and the toillet were specially dirty.)  
The apartment was not the one in the pictures and was not the one in the description ( in the description was a 1st floor and the appartment was on a 2nd floor). The furniture was not the one on the pictures. And there were no facilities for a confortable stay. ( no pillows enough for 2 people, no toilet papel, no towels, no pan,...)

The city center is easily reached by tram/metro or bus.
The area is quiet and green, there is a garden adjacent to one of the balconies. You can park you car on the street next to the garden, it's free.
(There is a 5 hour period per week on all streets in the neighbourhood in which you are not allowed to park. We didn't see the sign and got a parking ticket.) 
Highly recommended appartement!"

Die Kommunikation per SMS oder Mail mit Sandra war perfekt: Sie antwortete sehr schnell.
Die Lage der Wohnung ist optimal: Sehr ruhig, im Grünen und dennoch ist man schnell im Zentrum (5 Min. zu Fuss bis zur Bahn- oder Busstation)
Das Einzige, was wir vermisst haben, ist ein Tablar oder kleines Schrank-Abteil für die Kleider.
Ein äusserst empfehlenswertes Apartment!
Herzlichen Dank für die Gastfreundschaft, Sandra.

It's very pleasant to walk around the quiet neighborhood. Perfect for a family traveling with small children as the apartment has a very accommodating set-up for the little ones.

9581,1255668,189218868,2017-09-01,145194706,Magdalena,"Absolutely loved staying at Sandra's place. Lovely apartment with a small garden which you can also use. Clean, well equipped, has also good location with buses and there is a tram stop as well. Sandra was lovely and very helpful."
9582,1255668,266582011,2018-05-20,60330222,Corinne,Great location and super clean and fresh apartment. Lovely almost rural area yet within easy distance to downtown Stockholm.
9583,1255668,287443710,2018-07-08,32214340,Priska,"Wonderful appartment. Calm and a good comfortabel area close to  a beach.
The distance to the center and the transportation system was great.
Sarah responded directly and fast to our questions - she is very good hospitality ."
9584,1255668,297165173,2018-07-27,18066827,Elizabeth,"Sandra's place is very clean, comfortable and pleasant, with a beautiful back patio space complete with grill and picnic table - perfect for outdoor evening meals in summer! Sandra responded quickly when we had questions and check-in was seamless. The neighborhood is peaceful and attractive - very pleasant to return home to after day out in the city. For those using public transportation to get around - be aware that it takes a while to get to and from the city center. If this is not a concern, then I highly recommend Sandra's place!"
9585,1255668,300815554,2018-08-03,28977252,Sebastian,Die Wohnung wurde sehr geschmackvoll neu eingerichtet. Wir haben es sehr genossen zu Fuss zum Badeplatz laufen zu können.
9586,1255668,461852829,2019-06-01,3681864,Ronni,Fantastisk lejlighed i et dejligt område. Det føltes virkelig som et “home away from home”. Meget stor anbefaling
9587,1255668,488633264,2019-07-15,96945152,Oksana,"We are very lucky!  Very quiet place among nature.  By bus 15-20 minutes - and we are in the city center!  The apartment has everything you need.  Very clean.  The hostess answers all questions, is welcoming and hospitable."

Das Appartement ist skandinavisch schick eingerichtet und sehr sauber. Sandra hat extra Platz freigeräumt in Schränken und Kühlschrank. Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt. Das Appartment liegt etwas ausserhalb, die Innenstadt ist aber mit Bus, der alle10 min fährt, super gut zu erreichen. Die Bushaltestelle ist 3 min von der Unterkunft entfernt. Die Wohnung liegt in einem ruhigen Wohnviertel. Besonders gut hat uns die Badetelle gefallen, die auch in wenigen Minuten zu Fuss zu erreichen ist. Wir haben jeden Tag gebadet. Ein Traum mitten in einer Großstadt."
9590,1261445,6960641,2013-09-01,6248004,Alexandra,Great host who really went out of her way to make our stay perfect!!!!!! Beautiful and cozy apartment :) 
9591,1261445,11398843,2014-04-01,2544398,Cat & Mike,"Marie-Louise's apartment is just as lovely as it looks in the pictures, with a super comfy bed! A great place to stay and discover the city. The area seemed to be very up and coming and the apartment is just a 2 minute walk from a direct subway line into the city which with a 7 day pass is a bargin for any European capital. I would recommend this apartment to anyone looking for a place to stay that is close enough to the city to enjoy the attractions in the day and the nightlife in the evening, but away from the tourist crowds so you feel like you can really be a part of the live of Stockholm. Thank you Marie!"
9592,1261445,11670479,2014-04-11,3556952,Jo,"Lovely flat, just as it looks in the pictures.  Perfectly clean, everything worked well.  It has a view over a park, so there's lots of light and greenery.  The bed is in a slightly separate room, so you don't feel like you're sleeping in the living room or eating in the bedroom!  There's a cute, small bathroom (apparently normal for the area) and a well equipped kitchen. 

Neighbourhood was perfect for my needs, with lots to do and see nearby and good transportation links to the rest of Stockholm.

Marie Louise was a helpful, charming and communicative host. Definitely recommend this place. "
9593,1261445,11842827,2014-04-16,13499258,Lars,"In a few words: perfect stay, perfect home & perfect host. Thank you very much, Marie-Louise. You were so courteous."

The area is quiet and you are close to city center even by foot ! 
I definitely recommend to stay at her place for a few days ! You feel like at home :)"
9595,1261445,12507409,2014-05-04,1376665,Daniele,We spent a great time in Stockholm. The flat is very close to all services and it is very warm and cosy. Marie-Louise and her daughter were very smart and kind. They were very willing during our trip. We advice the flat! 
9596,1261445,13038589,2014-05-18,13858723,Diana,"We really would recommend Marie- Louise's apartment. It's very lovely, clean and is really well situated (you can easily reach the metro station or the bus to the airport). Although it is so central, it's really quiet. Her daughter introduced us in everything very nicely. Thanks for everything."

9600,1261445,15484762,2014-07-10,1674745,Marise,"We were very impressed from beginning to end. The apartment is the most beautiful we have ever stayed in, with exquisite interior design, an amazing location close to many conveniences, and with a very comfortable bed. Marie-Louise and her daughter were splendid hostesses, very communicative, helpful, gracious, and informative. We would undoubtedly love to stay here again, because we could not have wished for a better experience."
9601,1261445,16072054,2014-07-22,2012797,Joseph,"We had a wonderful time in Mary-Louise's apartment. The location is great, right across the street from the park and very close to the metro. The apartment is lovely. I recommend it!"
9602,1261445,16825858,2014-08-03,14308304,Steven,"Marie-Louise is an excellent host; she welcomed us (along with her grown-up daughter) to the apartment and we just chatted informally until we knew everything we needed to. The apartment is compact and the space is cleverly designed to be comfortable and to function well. 

I chose the location carefully as I wanted us to be able to swim whenever we wanted but also to have easy access to the rest of Sodermalm and the city centre. I had no experience of the Hornstull neighbourhood so that was a really pleasant surprise, with its casual restaurants, excellent breakfast venues and the added bonus of a floating bar/restaurant on the Strand - all conveniently close to the T-ban station.

My partner and I would stay in the apartment again without hesitation."
9603,1261445,17829541,2014-08-18,16334612,Tanja,"We had a really good time in Marie-Luise´s cozy apartment - great host, great neighborhood, highly recommendable!
"
9604,1261445,19266202,2014-09-09,17581826,Frances,"Marie-Louise and her daughter were at the apartment when we arrived and gave us a very warm welcome.  They explained how everything worked and where to find things.  They even left bowls of chips and sweets for us and also fruit, which I thought was very thoughtful.

The apartment was small but bigger than a hotel room and very charming.  The bed was a queen size and very comfortable.  The bathroom with the Stockholm shower was a little awkard but adequate for our needs.

We choose the area to be near relatives in Stockholm but would like staying there regardless.  It was close to the tunnelbanna, shops and restaurants.  The street was quiet considering it's central location and even the bells from the church opposite did not disturb us. It is a very nice area and just a short walk away is Langholmen where there is water, a beach and parkland.  We had a family picnic there.

I would have no trouble recommending this apartment for it's character and location.  Marie-Louise was a charming host and the apartment was very clean and comfortable."
9605,1261445,19832769,2014-09-19,11643525,Alexis,"Marie-Louise is a great host of course. smooth communication, complete privacy, great apartment with very nice deco and plenty of fruit and candy + towels prepared when we arrived! Excellent and highly recommended. The area is definitely one of the best in Stockholm, and I'm from there so I know what I'm talking about. Thanks Marie-Louise!"
9606,1261445,21004587,2014-10-09,3637207,Joli,"Marie-Louise was very quick with responses, gave feedback on how best get to her apartment from the the Hornstull bus station, which was close by, and extremely accommodating. Her and her daughter were very hospitable in welcoming us to their apartment, showing us where everything was at and the ""how-tos"" of the bathroom (Stockholm shower, not an issue though, easy to use) and greeting us with snacks to share, which was extra thoughtful. The apartment itself was exactly as advertised, very clean, organized and cozy. It was a beautiful home to stay in and the area was very nice too, good restaurants not far from it, and the metro is a block away. Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay while in Stockholm.  "
9607,1261445,21763421,2014-10-23,17441881,Adrian Et Annick,"We had had a wonderful time in Marie-Louise warm and cosy appartment. It's just in front of a lovely park and close to Hornstull metro station, which is very close to Slussen. Thank you very much Marie-Louise for making us feel at home ( chips, fruits, and all the kind explanations given by Bianca :-)). I highly recommend this place! "
9608,1261445,22987969,2014-11-19,13722297,Joshua,"The apartment was exactly as on the pictures, with extra good surprises, such as the beautiful entrance, the view on the park, all the fresh and beautiful flowers, the warmth despite the cold outside.
As Marie-Louise was not well at the time of our stay, we did not get to meet her, which is a shame as it is part of the whole experience to meet with the local host, to get insider's experience and get to know the neighborhood quickly. My girlfriend and I only stayed 4 nights (I took her to Sweden on a surprise trip) and so I felt a bit lost in the Hornstull neighborhood. Despite this issue, the neighborhood is close to Slussen and Soho, and might be more of a booming area in the summer, whilst still providing some tasty venues for dinners and fika. 
The apartment in itself is splendid (the wooden floors, the color matching themes, the antiques…), there are blinds to block out the sun, and it's great to have no vis-a-vis, just the view of the park. Nice plants, modern kitchen fully equipped. The lighting is also great and adjustable, and is so important to create an atmosphere. The bed is simply amazing (big and so comfortable) and we had some of the best nights sleep there ever. The bathroom is cute and added to the coziness. The size of the apartment was perfect for us, with the couch area to hang out and watch series or read, have a cup of tea whilst listening to some music, which is separate from the bed and dressing area. 
Would recommend this apartment because it is totally awesome, and has a special 'something'  that makes it unique and special and that's what I look for in an Airbnb experience. "

Nicely decorated with beautiful european antiques but the apartment is nicely renovated and the kitchen modern. Though the bathroom is very small, the Stockholm shower actually works out just fine. Everything is well designed to work in the small space. I look forward to staying here again!"
9615,1261445,31716475,2015-05-09,15866000,Pauline,"Our stay at Marie Louise's place was great, her appartment has really nice features : nice building, calm, view of the park, light, homy and cosy, clean, convenient (even the shower -which can seem small at first- is very functional), comfortable and well located (the subway is a 3 minutes walk which is very convenient). Plus Marie Louise left us fruit and treats and fresh flowers in a vase to welcome us which was a very nice touch. I highly recommend it!"
9616,1261445,32269400,2015-05-16,31954365,Sze Ping,"My wife and I spend a week in Stockholm in Marie-Louise's apartment. She is such a lovely host. She waited for us in the apartment and shared with us information about the city and the district. Her apartment is very bright and tidy. The apartment is not big, but spacious enough for a person or a couple. It is very cosy and classy.  The nearby area is not noisy at all, and very convenient and accessible. Subway station is just 5 min away. We love the apartment a lot. Highly recommended. "

The apt. Was filled with fresh fruit, roses, candy. It is light filled and beautifully decorated. It was a perfect base for our Stockholm stay"
9619,1261445,34187665,2015-06-06,25486593,Stuart,"This was a lovely apartment, well situated in Sodermalm. Marie-Louise was the perfect host and responded to all e mails quickly. She and her daughter met us at the apartment and made us feel really welcome and had provided fresh fruit and flowers and other grocery basics which as greatly appreciated.

The property is indeed a 3 minute walk to the Metro and shops and about 20 minutes to the Old Town.

Highly recommended - Many thanks"
9620,1261445,34825913,2015-06-12,21813743,Yuting,"Me and my mum we love the place and had a great experience at Marie-Louise's apartment. 

The apartment: very clean, nice, beautiful, carefully decorated with many amazing detailes. We got everything we need. Comfortable bed and sofa. Almost looks like my dream home :)

The location: on the best island - south island. very close to metro station. couple of mins walk you can reach the water, we did a evening walk there and the view and sunset was amazing.

Communication: Marie-Louise is super nice. Waited us at the apartment to give us the key. Very easy to communicate and always ready to help and respond. 

HIGHLY RECOMMEND! "
9621,1261445,35539125,2015-06-20,2733607,Laurie,"I agree with all the great reviews of Mary-Louise's beautiful Södermalm apartment, which is perfect for two people. Very tiny bathroom by American standards, but the Stockholm shower actually works really well and is a space-saver. There is a stunning view of Högalids Kyrka and its surrounding park from the ceiling-high windows. A huge Hemköp grocery is just blocks away at the Hornstull ""mall"" with fresh, beautiful food. Lots of great shops (H&M Home!); juice bars, sushi, tapas, pizza and Lebanese restaurants and several great bars for people watching. One of the most beautiful 180° views of Stockholm is available by walking along Söder Mälarstrand, accessible within minutes from the apartment. If you're there in the summer be sure to look for the stretch of canal under and near the nearby bridges that contains dozens of mint-condition, vintage wooden speedboats. We had dinner at a terrific tapas place, Linje Tio at 24 Hornsbruksgatan."
9622,1261445,36533689,2015-06-29,16184649,Daniel,"Man sieht, spürt, fühlt, dass Marie-Louise Wert auf die Liebe im Detail legt. Das ruhig gelegene Appartement (mit angenehmen und beruhigenden Ausblick) war ästhetisch eingerichtet; mit vielen spannenden Objekten. Wir teilen diese Vorliebe und haben uns deshalb außerordentlich wohl gefühlt.

Ansonsten teilen wir alle bisherigen Kommentare.

Her apartment is in a fantastic location and very well-equipped and her daughter Bianca was so helpful, giving us great advice about where to go and what to see. It was a bonus that Marie-Louise had left some delicious fruit and chips as a welcome gift. "
9624,1261445,38103596,2015-07-13,4947269,Jochen,Marie Louise picked us up at the tube station due to really horrible rain. That was really nice. She had fresh fruits ad some sweets for us.
9625,1261445,42837020,2015-08-16,10887480,Jenny,We were made very welcome by Bianca even though we arrived quite late at night after our flight was delayed. She took the time to show us everything in the apartment and to give us some tips for local shops and restaurants and sightseeing in Stockholm.  
9626,1261445,44536750,2015-08-27,736309,Sarah,"Marie-Louise's apartment is the perfect place to stay in Stockholm -- it is extremely convenient to the metro, is situated just across from (and with a stunning view of) a park containing a gorgeous cathedral, and is just a couple short blocks to the heart of Hornstull.  It is beautifully decorated, has amazing amenities, and is very cozy.  It was incredibly easy to coordinate our arrival and departure.  We felt very welcome.  We would stay here again if we're lucky enough to return to Stockholm in the future!"
9627,1261445,45667152,2015-09-05,37138272,George,"Marie-Louise makes you feel like her home is your home.  She gives a great orientation with her daughter, and even provided some food, e.g., fruit, chips, candy, cheese.  The apartment is perfect from many (Website hidden by Airbnb) a 4 minute walk to the T-bana and is a 10 minute ride to Gamla Stan and Centralen.  I actually enjoyed take the # 4 bus, which is short walk as well.  The apartment is very comfortable, nice furnishings, dishwasher, good wi-fi, cable tv with many English speaking stations and a washer/dryer in the basement.  The only concern for Americans would be the very small bathroom.  I was fine with it but some of my compatriots are used to big luxurious bathrooms.  If that's you, Sweden isn't the country for you.  I met many locals who told me the small bathroom in the apartment is typical to most Swedish apartments.  Honestly, for a week, it wasn't a problem for me whatsoever.  I highly recommend this apartment.  You will love it and will be made to feel at home by the lovely host.

"
9628,1261445,46874732,2015-09-14,29957288,Krista,"Marie-Louise and her daughter were very welcoming to her home upon our arrival to Stockholm. We had a great experience staying at the flat, the area is very quiet with a few hip cafes, bars and restaurants in close walking distance. The metro line is a short 5 min walk and Marie Louise gave us some great tips on places to eat and see while we were visiting town.  She also left us snacks too. She was very easy to get in touch with and her space was clean, comfortable, tidy and well decorated. The bathroom is very tiny but other than that I would recommend this flat to anyone staying in Stockholm. "
9629,1261445,47473615,2015-09-19,8744501,Hannah,"Gorgeous, light, beautifully-kept apartment - even better than in the photos! Marie-Louise was the perfect host - easy to contact, ever helpful and there to meet us on arrival. She provided us with plenty of hints and tips for our stay and had, very generously, left some fruit, crisps and sweets for us to enjoy. Not at all expected, but a lovely surprise. The apartment is in a good location, close to shops, restaurants and the metro. It's equally well positioned if you want to walk (and don't mind a good stroll - we managed 27,000 steps one day!) to the more touristy areas. Would definitely recommend."
9630,1261445,48605984,2015-09-27,7874034,Alvaro,"It is not easy to avoid the uncertainties and doubts when you go to a place that you’ve never been before, you never know what you will find, but with Marie-Louise and Bianca It wasn’t like that, It was like go to a friend’s apartment that welcomes you with a smile and shows you everything as it is, even what you get is better. It is nice feeling of gratitude in that first moment, and a pleasure the rest of the days. The neighbourhood is quite and public transportation is good, the subway is less than five minutes walking from the apartment."
9631,1261445,49215767,2015-10-02,2016662,Stephen,"We were greeted at the apartment by Marie-Louise's daughter who showed us how everything worked. The apartment is charming and is fine for a couple. The location is great - it is across the street  from a park and the iconic Hogalid church, and is close to public transportation including the fast bus from the airport.  

Marie-Louise questioned us when we inquired about the reservation  to make sure we were OK with a small bathroom, and indeed this apartment has a small bathroom. The bathroom was fine for our 2 day stay."
9632,1261445,53044497,2015-11-04,3299688,Jeong Eun,"We have kept a good first impression and start the tour in Stockholm. It was because the room was very cozy. And marie was so nice to us. It seems to be a good place to have a good memory of the beautiful Stockholm travel. Traffic was very convenient, the subway and the market was done in 5 minutes. It remains in our memory as one place in one of the most beautiful places in Stockholm. thank you, marie! :) "

The apartment was a short walk to the metro which made it very easy to travel to other parts of town. The local area in Hornstull is very peaceful, with local shops and restaurants close by. We would definitely recommend."

We bought a 7day pass for 300Kr and you can use that on the buses trams subways and the bus ferries! The bathroom is small but I am over 6 foot tall and managed it fine.
There are lots of little cafes, bars and restaurants close by as well as a supermarket and liquor store.
Would definitely recommend staying here!"
9636,1261445,69195834,2016-04-10,14012476,Richard,"We had a fantastic stay at this apartment in Stockholm.  I was in touch with Marie-Louise a few days before our stay and everything was in order.  She even helped us to work out the best way to travel from the airport and to a Mumma Mia restaurant we visited one evening.  Although we didn't meet Marie-Louise on the first day, we did meet her daughter, everything in the apartment was explained in detail and we felt at home immediately.  They had even bought some staple foods as a gift (milk, eggs, cheese, ham, butter, chocolates and crisps) it was a lovely thought and really helped us the first morning.  The area is lovely with a great supermarket nearby, its a short walk to a tube station which is only 5 stops from the town centre and there is a fantastic tapas bar at the end of the road.  I would not hesitate to recommend this appartment to others, even we want to return already!"

We were greeted by her daughter Bianca who was very helpful in showing us around and spoke great English. It was very kind of them to also get some food in for us, we really appreciated the gesture after travelling, a real treat. The apartment was just gorgeous and very true to the images on here. It had a lovely cosy feeling and we looked forward to spending the evenings there after long days exploring Stockholm. A real home from home. I was sad to leave it! It wasn't too far from the Hornstull tube station and the supermarket either. There is a lift as well which is welcome after long days walking!!! It was a quiet and relaxed neighbourhood and I loved hearing the gentle church bells from over the road too. I highly recommend this apartment and will always treasure our time spent in Stockholm. Thanks Marie-Louise! "
9638,1261445,73729798,2016-05-09,53603373,Jackie,"Marie-Louise was a great host and her home is fabulous. The apartment is well designed and very functional. Lots of good towels and soft bed linen. The bathroom is small but that's not a problem, you can still have a good hot shower. Little touches like flowers and bowls of fruit were really appreciated. Hornstull was a good base, close to the tube and the bus frm airport stops about 5 minutes from apartment. Will definitely go back next time we visit family in Stockholm."
9639,1261445,74381703,2016-05-15,12853971,Laura,"Marie's apartment is lovely, we were met by her daughter who made us feel very welcome. It's in a great location, around 15-20 minutes from the center of town by train. There's a train station just around the corner, it's around a 5 min walk. There's also a very large supermarket at the train station. Marie was very generous and left fruit, chips and sweets out for us to enjoy. She also had fresh milk and juice ready in the fridge for us.
The apartment is very clean although be warned that the bathroom is small, very small. It's around the size of a toilet cubical, with a shower and sink in there. It works very well and is very efficient, it's a real Stockholm experience although quite different from a larger bathroom."
9640,1261445,75978536,2016-05-23,20564367,Robbie,"We were met by the host's daughter who showed us around the apartment. The apartment is exactly like the pictures, very clean and very charming. The host provided a care package of food and drinks which was much appreciated after a long journey! The area is great, some really lovely little restaurants and bars nearby - and a really good quality supermarket. The apartment has absolutely everything you will need and everything is easy to find. We walked/cycled everywhere and hired bikes at the host's suggestion. "
9641,1261445,79849860,2016-06-14,55378807,Jayne,Marie-Louise's apartment was fabulous. We stayed in the apartment for 17 days! The apartment is exactly as it is described. It is cozy but very comfortable and clean with great light and a great view of the church and park across the street. The location is perfect with easy access to the train and shopping and restaurants. We took advantage of the Stockholm city bikes which you can easily rent close to the apartment. Communication with Marie-Louise was easy. We were met at the apartment by her very hospitable daughter Bianca and welcomed with a few treats! If you are lucky enough to find this apartment available - book it! Enjoy!
9642,1261445,86048199,2016-07-14,3997238,Judy And Ed,Communication was very good. House was so cute and cozy across from a green area and close to the water. Quiet and very clean. Close to the T ban. Marie-Louise was very kind  and left us foods for breakfast. It was a great experience.
9643,1261445,87615355,2016-07-21,29192137,Yini,"Marie's daughter show us around the house. They prepared almost everything for us. The apartment is close to everywhere and let us feel like home. We had a good time here. If we come back, we will choose her apartment again. Thank you so much."

Kitchen had all mod cons, lounge and bedroom areas both very comfortable and apartment was very clean. The bathroom is small as described but works fine. Marie- Louise was also very generous with the food she provided for us and we were met by her daughter who was very helpful showing us around the apartment and directing us to local restaurants etc. The airport bus is even just around the corner. Would definitely recommend the apartment."
9645,1261445,95071292,2016-08-18,55871354,Nikolaj,Großartiges Appartement mit direktem Blick in den Högalidspark. Marie-Louise hat uns trotz sehr später nächtlicher Ankunft gemeinsam mit ihrer Tochter empfangen und noch einige gute Tips zu Stockholm allgemein bzw. bzgl. der direkten Nachbarschaft gegeben. Wir fanden einen gefüllten Kühlschrank vor und haben uns auch sonst sofort zuhause gefühlt. Fazit: eine lohnende Adresse für einen Stockholmtrip auch trotz des etwas höheren Preises.
9646,1261445,97964221,2016-08-29,47438563,Oliver,"This place was great! Very trendy, open plan apartment in a nice and accessible location.

Very helpful and quick to answer any questions by txt or email. Great pad for a great trip to Stockholm."
9647,1261445,100229167,2016-09-08,1196542,Emilie,"The apartment and location were perfect for our first visit to Stockholm. Bianca, Marie-Louise's daughter, met us to show us around the apartment when we arrived. They are the sweetest! They had stocked the fridge with so much food - totally unexpected. They left out a bouquet of fresh roses. So thoughtful. Communication was top-notch, and the apartment was very very clean. We would stay again! Thanks so much for hosting us. "

My wife, two year old, and I were welcomed warmly by Marie-Loises daughter, even fresh fruit was provided!!! Truly a generous host!!!
The apartment is close to the subway, situated right across from the most beautiful church, with those same church views. 
Great restaurants and cafes very close. 
We stayed 22 days!
Could not recommend more!!"
9649,1261445,114022764,2016-11-15,75804933,Susan,"We absolutely loved this charming apartment in the Hornstull neighborhood and Marie-Louise was the perfect host. The t-bana is a short walk and it is very easy to get around Stockholm from the apartment. There is a Stockholm shower which we found to be no issue. Marie-Louise had stocked the kitchen with lots of food choices and fresh fruit, coffee, bread, eggs and milk - there are two grocery stores nearby so getting any other foods was very easy. As an added bonus the view of the church across the street was beautiful at all times of the day. Thank you Marie-Louise for such a delightful place to stay while visiting Stockholm! Susan and Peter"

Logement très bien équipé (notamment la cuisine qui possède tous les équipements ménagers nécessaires). Il vous sera spécifié que la salle de bain est petite mais nous tenons à préciser que cela ne représente absolument pas un problème (et pourtant mon mari est plutôt grand :)). Un excellent accueil de la part de notre hôte qui nous a attendus jusqu'à minuit et demi car notre avion avait du retard. Marie-Louise avait laissé un frigo et des armoires pleines, ainsi que des fruits. L'appartement était parfaitement propre, rangé. Ambiance très cosy. En bref, on se sent comme chez soi chez Marie-Louise ! "
9651,1261445,120048802,2016-12-07,5337389,Denise,"Truly a home away from home! From arrival to departure, Marie-Louise was the best host! I mis-read our arrival time and we got to the apartment hours earlier than I had communicated, and Marie-Louise was so gracious and kind about our unexpected arrival. Her flat is warm and cozy; a perfect retreat after spending hours in the cold, exploring the city.  She also provided so much food (and homemade jam!) that proved to be quite useful late in the evenings when it was too cold to go out. We would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Stockholm! "
9652,1261445,125878585,2017-01-08,14639650,Catherine,"Many many thanks it was a real treat staying at Marie-Louise's place, we had a wonderful time. Apartment is exactly as described and really cosy and comfortable.

Marie Louise's daughter, Bianca, met us at the apartment and explained everything. The place was beautifully decorated and we immediately felt at home. It was very cozy.

Also, Marie-Louise supplied basic foodstuffs, eggs, cheese, juice, bread, milk, fruit, and on one of the tables a bouquet of fresh cut roses.

Communication was excellent throughout the reservation process and upon our arrival.

It was our first trip to Europe, a surprise for my wife's birthday, and we couldn't have been more pleased.

The view from the large windows was of a church with two tall steeples, and it was gorgeous.

We highly recommend Marie-Louise's place. Many thanks for making this stay wonderful!"

Excellent, prompt, clear communication, very fair price, well located neighborhood and gracious hostess.  We loved the apartment decor.  While it is a smaller space, the space is well utilized and it does not feel cramped.  Marie-Louise kindly provided breakfast and snacks, and her daughter Bianca was exceedingly helpful in showing us around the space and orienting us to the city.  If you like to walk there is a lovely path to stroll that leads to Gamla Stan, with great scenic views along the way.  Transportation, restaurants and food markets are all right nearby.  We would stay here again in a heartbeat, and highly recommend it to others!"

The Hornstull neighborhood was just what we were looking for - away from the tourist hustle and bustle but close to everything in Stockholm thanks to the subway just a 5 minute walk from the apartment.  We immediately found our ""local"", the tiny bar within a bar at Linje Tio - it was Negroni week which made us very happy.  Marie-Louie was out of town when we visited but her presence was felt.  She thoughtfully left us breakfast provisions and snacks which were much appreciated.  We loved having morning coffee looking out over the church and park across the street. We arrived late in the evening which was no problem - thank you, Carey, for staying up late to greet us and show us the lay of the land.  We enthusiastically recommend Marie-Louise's place!   "

We received a message from Marie-Louise as soon as we arrived to Stockholm that someone was waiting in the flat with keys and instructions. We felt really at home in the flat and all you need is there. The bed is super comfortable. The bathroom is small but it worked fine. We also used the laundry in the basement. Marie-Louise is great host and made us feel really welcome.

On top fanden wir einen gut gefüllten Kühlschrank und einen Obstteller vor.

The apartment is located in very close proximity to a transport hub and we were able to travel a short distance by train to every city location that we required and to catch the airport bus when leaving. 
The apartment is comfortable with an eclectic décor.  As indicated by the owner the bathroom shower arrangement is extremely confined but you get used to it quickly. The owner provided some snack and basic breakfast food  items. The large laundry in the basement enabled us to complete several loads of our washing and drying in a relatively short period of time.
The outlook over the church is very pleasant and the local area is safe and interesting."

Leave the window open so the sun and beautiful park view add the finishing touches. Cafes, gelato, and small shops around created a feeling of our very own welcoming neighborhood. Each day we walked all about...exploring the whole of Stockholm, but always were so glad to come back “home.” "

The kids upstairs were a bit raucous, but they went to bed early so were not a problem. Marie-Louis' daughter Bianca welcomed us and gave us many helpful tips and suggestions, as well as instructions on how to use everything. The bed was sooo comfortable, and the quiet lived-in feel of the apartment made us feel quite at home. We enjoyed all the little goodies Bianca was so kind as to have shopped for us, and we even got quite used to the ""Stockholm"" shower, which worked much better than we had expected. The Tapas restaurant down on the corner was excellent (make reservations or go early!), but the African place in the next black was totally forgettable. Only a block from the subway, buy a pass and get anywhere in town in just minutes."

It’s very close to convenient public transportation, including the bus to and from the airport. The pictures do a great job showing the delightful character of the space. It was very clean, the kitchen stocked (many hosts say they have a stocked kitchen - but this is the first time we could actually cook a full meal and had everything we needed from utensils to condiments). The couch and bed were very comfortable. The WiFi was reliable and fast. The shower is small but it worked out just fine. We didn’t get to meet Marie-Louise as she was abroad at the time but communication was always quick, clear and friendly. Her daughter Bianca met us at the apartment and showed us around and gave us some recommendations for nearby places to eat, visit and shop. We really appreciated the breakfast items and fruit she bought before our arrival. It was such great hospitality. We are definitely coming back."

The apartment is in a quiet neighborhood yet close to the subway and busses and many shops and restaurants. Marie-Louise kindly supplied us with everything needed for a light breakfast.

This was a very nice place to stay with lovely views of greenery and the old church across the street. I highly recommend it as a comfortable, well-appointed home away from home in Stockholm."

Stocked kitchen with everything you need, and she even stocked us with a few snacks, and drinks! Couch and bed pretty comfortable. The bathroom/Stockholm shower is sufficient, but it was a bit uncomfortable for my not so small husband. The area is a quick walk to the metro, lots of good food options and shopping close.

The apartment itself was lovely and Marie-Louise's daughter was there to give us the key even though we arrived late in the evening. We were also left some snacks and basics in the fridge which was lovely to have on arrival.

The kitchen is well equipped, and the WiFi worked well.

The bathroom is very small but we didn't really find this to be a problem.

It was perfect size for a family of 3, and could accommodate a family of 4 or 2 couples. It was very conveniently located to the metro and the commuter train. So really, only a 1 min walk to train and 5 min walk to metro. It was very safe and clean. It had so much light with all her windows! Very nice patio! She had a good size separate BR and well stocked kitchen. We cooked dinner almost every night. It has a wonderful choice of multiple grocery stores, bakeries, ATM machines close by, all within walking distance. Karin met us and spent a long time discussing sites to see, as well as recommendations for food and wine shopping. She was very accessible the whole time we were there! She responded quickly to our texts.

9699,1262188,8392119,2013-10-28,6954355,Salima,"The flat has a orginal plan which let circulate ideally light and energies and it is tastefully decorated. 

My two boys have liked very much the playground. It's true you can drink a tea on the balcony and overlook the children play in Timmermansparken. 

The situation in Sodermalm is very well, closed to Comuter train station (direct for going to Tometits with the kids), subway and many buses, clodes too supermarket, Café Hôtel Rival, etc... 

Karin is very nice person, helpfull, understanding (I've need her help at many time), "

Before we went on vacation to Stockholm, she helped us giving information about the city.
It was a nice neighbourhood, a nice appartment to stay at!

The apartment is spacious, open plan,  super clean, comfortable, windows all around for nice light and ventilation; a sitting porch, a well-equipped eat-in kitchen, a large bathroom with tub and washing machine, a bedroom and a bed in the large living space. Karin provided us with detailed and abundant suggestions on places to visit, especially tailored for our interests! She is exceedingly well-organized and thoughtful in her preparations of the apartment. Great communications. Our highest recommendations for Karin as a terrific airbnb host! "

This is a great location because it is near attractions like museums, places to eat and drink, and interesting walks and views. The apartment is spacious and light. Enjoyed the balcony. Easy to fix breakfast or snacks and get going. Buses and train very close. Karin was extremely helpful, flexible, and personable. "
9705,1262188,16651087,2014-07-31,13144538,Mathieu,"Nous n'avons pas eu la chance de rencontrer notre propriétaire.
Cependant, elle était très disponible par mail, ce que nous avons apprécié, et nous avons récupéré les clés dans un supermarché à quelques mètres de l'appartement.
L'appartement est confortable et bien équipé: lave linges, lave vaisselles,
ainsi que tous les produits de première nécessité (papier toilette, bain douche, produits ménagers, sel, poivre, sucre, épices, céréales, huile...)
Les lits sont confortables, et l'appartement agréable, en particulier la terrasse où nous avons pris tous nos petits déjeuners.
Le quartier est agréable également avec un parc de jeux pour les enfants: balançoires, stade de foot...
Les sanitaires et la cuisine sont très propres, ainsi que les draps et linges de toilette.
Seul petit bémol: l'appartement est légèrement poussiereux, mais ce n'est pas du tout génant vu toutes les qualités de l'appartement citées plus haut, et son emplacement à un peu moins de 500 mètres du métro.
Nous recommandons donc cet appartement. "
9706,1262188,17297983,2014-08-10,5722551,Diede,"We really enjoyed our stay at Karins place. There's one bedroom and one big living/kitchen/bedroom with double bed. We stayed here with two couples and it was perfect like this. The apartment was clean and Karin gave us nice big towels to use. 

It's a nice neighborhood with nearby a supermarket. You can walk in two minutes to the train station, cosy södermalm with nice restaurants and shops is on a 7 minute walk and it's also possible to walk to the city center in about 15-20 minutes. 

Highly recommended for an amazing city trip to Stockholm!

Wir haben uns alle sehr wohl gefühlt und haben unseren Urlaub dort sehr genossen. Die Wohnung war sehr sauber und ordentlich, praktisch eingerichtet und voll ausgestattet. Es gibt nichts, was man vermissen würde. Die 1000 Kleinigkeiten (wie z.B. Gewürze), die eine Küche gut machen, sind alle vorhanden. 

Die Wohnung ist verkehrsgünstig gelegen, nicht weit von einer Pendelzugstation entfernt. Bei schönem Wetter sind wir auch ab und zu bis in die Altstadt gelaufen.

Im Hof gibt es einen großen Spielplatz, den die Kinder oft und gerne genutzt haben.

Der Kontakt mit Karin per Email und Telefon im Vorfeld und während des Aufenthaltes war sehr angenehm. Sie war immer sehr hilfsbereit und stand uns bei Fragen freundlich zur Seite und hatte auch gute Tipps für den Aufenthalt.

Wir haben die Zeit in Karins Wohnung sehr genossen - es war ein rundum schöner Urlaub, an den wir gern zurückdenken.

Vielen Dank dafür!"

Karin's place is very well-located within the Södermalm area of Stockholm.

Stockholm est vraiment une ville très agréable, surtout avec des enfants. L'appartement de Carl est vraiment très bien décoré, bien équipé et situé dans un quartier familial proche du centre et de plusieurs parcs comportant des airs de jeux pour les enfants. A notre arrivée, l'appartement était très propre. 
Carl a pris le soin de nous fournir des instructions écrites et des vidéos pour l'utilisation des différents appareils.
Carl est vraiment un hôte très agréable : il est réactif, accueillant et soucieux que ses invités passent un agréable séjour (il s'assure que nous soyons bien arrivés et que tout fonctionne correctement).

We stayed in Carl's apartment with our two boys for two weeks. 
Stockholm is really a very pleasant city, especially with children. Carl's apartment is really very well decorated, well equipped and located in a family neighbourhood close to the centre and several parks with playgrounds for children. When we arrived, the apartment was very clean. 
Carl took care to provide us with written instructions and videos for the use of the various devices.
Carl is really a very pleasant host: he is responsive, welcoming and concerned that his guests have a pleasant stay (he makes sure that we have arrived safely and that everything works properly). Carl also did not hesitate to take the time to give us some ideas for family visits.  
If we stay in Stockholm again we will certainly get the same apartment. Thank you Carl! Ophélie and Fabrice"
9757,1263992,5828820,2013-07-18,6883156,Grethe,"Scott har en dejlig funktionel lejlighed beliggende på øen Lille Essinge ca. 15 min kørsel i bus fra Stockholm centrum. 

Alt fungerer fint med køkken, bad, vaskemaskine og tørretumbler, opholdsstue og terrasse. Der er elevator og mulighed for at leje Scotts parkeringsplads under lejlighedskomplekset - anbefales, hvis Scott ikke selv bruger den, da der kun er offentlig betalingsparkering udenfor bygningen. Vi var 2 voksne og vores datter på 15 år, der boede i lejligheden i 7 dage - henover weekenden kom vores søn og hans kæreste og overnattede 2 nætter - de puslede lidt rundt med hynderne til de 2 sofaer i stuen, så de kunne ligge ved siden af hinanden :-) den ene på hynderne på gulvet og den anden på en sofa. Lejligheden er på 5. sal og placeret sådan, at den direkte udsigt er til andre lejligheder i bygningen overfor - skråt til venstre ses lidt vandmiljø. Omkring ved 17-18-tiden kommer solen forbi lejligheden i et par timer, ellers ligger den i skygge.

Scott havde meget betænksomt købt et buskort til os, så der var penge nok til, at vi kunne komme til centrum, hvorefter vi selv kunne fylde kortet op med yderligere kørepenge. Det koster 25 kr. pr. person at køre/sejle med SL-selskabet overalt i 75 min. inkl. bus/bådskift.

Vi havde en fantastisk dejlig ferie i Stockholm med skønne oplevelser byen, i omegnen og i skærgården - det kan helt klart anbefales at sejle en tur ud i skærgården og besøge en af de skønne øer. Vi havde pragtfuldt vejr med varme og høj sol, da vi var der - det forskønner jo enhver oplevelse :-)

Det er første gang Scott udlejer sin lejlighed, og med et par fif til ham om nogle opmærksomhedspunkter, vil jeg helt klart anbefale at leje denne lejlighed."

I really appreciate the interaction with Scott, it was very pleasant.

The apartment is well located: it's in a calm area, just 15 minutes away from the center of Stockholm by public transportation. It's really nice, well-appointed and modern. There's a balcony with a table where you can have a meal looking at a stretch of water. There's also a barbecue!!
So, this option is really affordable and worthwhile!
Super recommended!!!

9760,1263992,6663223,2013-08-20,2700930,Maura,Scott was very helpful and met us at the bus stop and walked us to his apartment which is only a five min walk from the No 1 bus stop. The apartment is much bigger and brighter than shown and was very clean and very comfortable. I was attending a conferences at Filmhhuset and the bus brought us to within a five minute walk of the Filmhhuset building.  I would strongly recommend Scott's apartment. 
9761,1263992,7379662,2013-09-17,8658093,Maximilian,"The appartment is amazing, so modern, very cosy, clean and well equipped. We really enjoyed our stay there. Even the two couches as sleeping facilities were really good. The public transport connection was really good, too. The bus station was only 3 walking minutes away and the line 1 drove us always (even during the nights in a 20 minutes stroke) within 15 minutes to cityterminalen (=main station). Scott was furthermore very helpful in providing information and he answered always promptly. 
I will return by all means!"

Anytime we go back to Stockholm now we will definitely be staying with Andre! HIGHLY RECOMMEND."

Right after booking Andre got in contact and gave us very precise manual how to get and what to do. We got in very smooth. Thanks Andre it was easy to communicate.
The apartment is very clean and spacious with fully equipped kitchen and big common room. There are no animals inside. The room has enough space for two persons to stay on several days.
Nothing to complain. It a was a good place to stay for our short shopping binge :)

Most of the time, André was not at home, so we had the apartment all for ourselves. We've appreciated the privacy, his warm welcome, his clear communication and good upfront advice! The king-size bed was very soft and comfy. André knows the best places in town. Highly recommended."

Thanks for everything"
9772,1271843,11969012,2014-04-20,1865604,Eric,"André pretty much sets the bar for hosting.  Couldn't have asked for more with his hospitality and wealth of knowledge of where to go in Stockholm.  What's hot, what's not, and all the insider tips for various neighborhoods proved to be a real help in navigating through all that this great city has to offer.  Even moreso,  André was very generous with his time in getting me situated and comfortable in his place along with a tour of his neighborhood.  If you want a real insider's guide to Stockholm along with a friendly, easygoing host then this is the place.  "
9773,1271843,33486084,2015-05-28,2039120,Lynne,Andre's fiancé Johanna greeted us on arrival at their apartment and she was an absolute delight. She made us feel very welcome and offered much information on the surrounding area together with details on directions for meeting our ship. The apartment was very clean and tidy. The location was close to Gamla Stan and within walking distance of attractions. We were able to do laundry in the shared commercial washing machines and dryers. This was something you cannot always achieve when traveling. We enjoyed our stay at Johanna and Andre's cute apartment and thank you Johanna for your lovely assistance.

Andre had prepared a document that provided ample information about getting around, and to the apartment. It also has many recommendations of things to do/eat as well! That was really helpful! :)

The apartment is clean and very spacious. Its location is quiet and not too densely populated - which makes it nice and relaxing. :) It was easy to get around too with the metro station just a 2 minute walk away from the apartment. 

I would recommend this listing, as well as Andre and Johanna as hosts. It was lovely having stayed and met with them! Thank you!"

André was actually out of town the weekend I was there, but Johanna was there to greet me. She was incredibly friendly and welcoming, offering refreshments from the kitchen as well as a custom-made local map with her personal recommendations for me. We sat down and chatted, which really helped me to feel relaxed and at home--of course Johanna's calm yet friendly and outgoing manner helped too!

The apartment is spacious and very clean. The room is quite beautiful; I would say the photos on here don't really do it justice. Johanna also offered me use of a bicycle during my stay, and even helped me figure out the train schedule for going to the airport when I left!"

They went above and beyond as accommodating hosts to make sure we had great recommendations for Stockholm, work around our travel schedules, and even met us for a great dinner. They are both extremely personal and hospitable. Their flat is well-decorated, spacious, and clean, and they will make you feel at home. The location is perfect--You really get the best of both worlds with a quiet, hip neighborhood, but are also 2 min walk to the subway and an easy walk to the big sites at Gamla Stan.

They gave us an incredible list of ideas typed out of what to do and where to eat within the time frame we had, which was two days. We had a wonderful evening just sitting and talking and getting to know one another. They even assisted us with all travel plans from their apartment to Gotland, including transportation and lodging. The location is excellent within Sodermalm, with easy walking distance to city center and many museums and beaches. The apartment is very spacious and very clean.

But it was totally different than i thought, because Andrè was super amazing host!

He was being so kind, and friendly to us even we had never met before, just like old friend.!!
And he offers super-detail local infos and recommendation which is really helpful. 

The place is perfectly clean and neat more than the pics, close to the metro like a minute away by walk, and also a big grocery store near by.

The apartment is in a great location in Southern, central Stockholm. The metro and a bike station are less than 100m from the front door which is amazingly convenient. The apartment itself is beautiful. One of the comfiest beds I've ever slept in and an incredibly quiet bedroom. The kitchen is well stocked and includes everything you could possibly need. André has done an amazing job making the place feel like home.

As for the hosts - what a lovely couple. We were lucky enough to catch them for dinner on our second night in town. You couldn't ask for more interesting or thoughtful hosts - nothing was too much trouble and communication was excellent from start to finish.

All in all a wonderful experience in one of my favourite cities in the world. Thanks both!

P.s., If you're coming by car there's free on-street parking available just a 30 minute walk or 3 stop metro ride from the apartment in Liljeholmen. We left our car there for 6 days with no problem whatsoever."

Their house is very convenient to everything - Metro, pharmacy and local supermarket, very good bar and surrounding nearby. We had a wonderful stay in their house, the South Island is the most trendy and lovely place in Stockholm with the best view! And also quite close to the old town. Recommend!"

9828,1271843,217785843,2017-12-10,3688873,Rebecca,"André's apartment was ideal for us. It's very spacious, spotless and stylish. We more than had everything we needed, including run of the fridge, coffee machine, and toiletries and other thoughtful additions dotted around. André was very responsive before and during our stay, making sure everything was going smoothly for us. You can reach lots of good restaurants, bars and cafes on foot, and easily walk to Gamla Stan, the Fotografiska, and Slussen to catch boats. The metro is really close too. A tip - don't take loads of cash to Stockholm, lots of places are card only :) Thanks André, hope to be back one day!"
9829,1271843,223423384,2018-01-01,1365201,Enrica,"The apartment is very nice and comfortable. It is in a perfect location: a few steps from the metro and in the trendiest district of Stockholm. Andrè was a perfect host, even if at a distance (in those days he was out of town): he left us all the useful information about the apartment and to move to Stockholm, and made us welcome by his friend Michael, very nice and friendly person, which suggested us different things to do and accompanied for the city. I advise everyone to spend a few days in Stockholm, a unique city, and to stay in a cozy apartment with very helpful people."
9830,1271843,226932930,2018-01-13,22368044,Sudi,"Fantastic location, close to a brilliant chocolate shop and the best bakery in Stockholm, Petrus.  Andre was an an extremely good and efficient communicator and everything worked out very well. The bedroom was a little smaller than I was expecting though all fine and beautiful living room plus, unusually, access to garden."
9831,1271843,244953489,2018-03-20,13194775,Heidi,"Andre and Camilla make you feel welcome and offer you a home away from home. Everything is clean and tastefully furnished, within a few minutes you find shops and trendy restaurants (good suggestions from Andre and Camilla). The next metro station is 3-5 minutes away and the old town of Stockholm in about 20 min. by foot. For a short stay in Stockholm highly recommended :-) Thanks to Andre and Camilla to share this welcoming place with us!"
9832,1271843,253083164,2018-04-13,391687,Melina,"Andre is a fabulous host with a beautiful home. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The best part of our experience was getting to know Andre who is exceptionally kind, friendly, and caring. His home is immaculate, spacious, and very comfortable with very nice furniture and lots of happy plants in the windows. The location is very peaceful and also centrally located in the heart of Sodermalm. I highly recommend staying with him!"

André was super responsive and he had great tips for restaurants and things to do. The apartment is very clean and well equipped with everything you might need. I would highly recommend staying here.
And although we did not meet with André - checkin was super easy and he was always reachable when we needed something. Thanks for your hospitality!"
9835,1271843,266546343,2018-05-20,11964929,Katherine,"Andre's gorgeous apartment is everything you could want for a stay in Sweden. Insanely central (there is a metro stop literally around the corner) it is also quiet and peaceful. Everything is sparkling clean, and Andre is a responsive and friendly host. Had a fantastic time and would stay there again!"
9836,1271843,268938590,2018-05-26,907956,Ryan,"We had an excellent stay at André's place.
It's really well located and a very comfortable space.
We found it great for exploring the cool neighbourhoods of Södermalm, with heaps of great bars, restaurants and shopping within easy walking distance. The Mariatorget Metro station is also super close, for getting to anywhere else in Stockholm.
André was also a great host. We didn't get to see a lot of him because there is so much do in Stockholm and we spent every hour possible getting to know the city, but we did have a couple of great chats and he checked in a few times with us via email, to make sure everything was going well and with some really helpful tips. He's a genuinely lovely guy and we highly recommend staying here.
Our only regret is that we couldn't stay longer!"
9837,1271843,272796340,2018-06-04,50407120,James,"Gorgeous space. Beautifully decorated, super clean, plenty of room for two, you can be standing on a metro platform in 1 minute or can walk anywhere you need to be, room itself is quiet but only a block from parks and a lively street, I would live here if I could! André is a fantastic host, so kind, interesting, knowledgeable, and helpful. Nothing but great things to say about the whole experience."

9839,1271843,278953178,2018-06-19,13268041,Alisa & Andy,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for 4 nights and loved André’s place. He left us the whole apartment for most of our time there, but we were lucky to get to hang out and talk to him twice - he had a couple great recommendations and was generally just fun to talk to. The room was great and exactly as described in the listing. The apartment as a whole was beautifully decorated, and we appreciated being able to use the kitchen to cook for ourselves. Possibly the best part about this place was the location, though: easily reached from the airport by public transit and walkable from most spots we wanted to visit. We highly recommend staying here!"
9840,1271843,287307051,2018-07-08,38152974,Erica,"We stayed at Andre's flat during our visit to Stockholm.

The flat was clean and had a comfortable bed and a nice size bathroom/shower. The flat was in an amazing location. It was near to the metro, a supermarket, pharmacy and restaurants. We'd highly recommend staying at Andre's home."

First of all, communication with Andre was always quick, easy and smooth. It gave me an strong impression, that everything will go well in this trustworthy person’s place for sure, and it really went so. 

My friends really liked the beautiful apartment and told me that Andre was a super nice person :-) Location was, as many of others have written here also, perfect. Thank you very much Andre!!! "

Easy to find as it is right around the corner from a metro station - André gave very clear directions on how to find his home as well. His communication was GREAT, we could reach out whenever necessary and he would reply almost immediately! 
We loved his apartment, if we find ourselves in Stockholm again we are for sure staying with him!"

9856,1271843,325327708,2018-09-19,42672910,Sebastian,"I’ve been travelling around the world and staying at many airbnbs. My experience has almost always been great. But i’d never met a host as kind and thoughtful as Andre. here’s what happened: Whenever i book, i book “entire place”. This time i must’ve forgotten to turn on that filter, so it was a surprise when me and my wife learned, upon arriving, that we’d rented just a room. However, andre offered to crash at a friend’s house just to give us privacy. And he did. Communication with him was fluid, he’s the kind of person we could be friends with. The place itself is big, clean, nice, and the bed is really comfortable. Loved the sodermalm area as well, full of cafes and very well connected. Highly recommended!!!"

The apartment was fantastic, bigger than expected and if you're a fan of Scandinavian mid-century design then the perfect accompaniment to your experience. 
The location was also ideal for us, so much is walkable from his place we only ever needed to take public transport when getting to/from the airport and when there was a larger body of water requiring ferry!"

Il nous a même laissé un vélo pour flâner dans les vieilles rues de Stockholm et est de très bon conseil ! Je le recommande les yeux fermés.

9877,1271843,456632813,2019-05-22,6452404,Jasmine,"My husband and I stayed at Andre's place for 5 nights.  His place was extremly clean and organized. The bed was very comfortable and the location was very conveniently located. Andre is a thoughful host with a great sense of humor. 

 Right before we arrived Andre's place, we were terribly disappointed with our airbnb experience in London despite of the fact the host in London has over seventy five 5 star reviews.  

Staying at Andre's place restored our faith in airbnb again.  Andre is a true SuperHost and he deserves more than 5 stars!  I highly recommend Andre's place! He is a 10 star host!"

My bed was super comfortable and I really enjoyed the spacious bathroom. The apartment is located 30 seconds away from a subway station which made it really easy to get around.

Yesterday it was very windy and we came back earlier. Andre told us there was a jazz event in a bar “häktet” . Really fantastic experience !"

9895,1272348,62751178,2016-02-16,11687248,Ruben,"Magnus really went out of his way to help us celebrate valentines weekend in Stockholm. Check-in went effortless and communication was good at all times. Apartment is located in (in my opinion) the best part of town, literally 5 minutes from a subway station on a major line - 15 minutes from the central train station. It's more spacious than the pictures would suggest, apartment has everything anyone would ever need and the bed is easily big enough for two people.

Would definitely recommend Magnus' apartment for anyone looking to stay in Stockholm"

It's a couple of train stops out of time, but we picked it as it was such a good price compared to others that were more centrally located. You could walk to town if you're happy to walk half an hour. Or if your getting the hop on hop off bus then the stop is 5 mins walk away. Was bigger in person than I thought it looked in pictures which was nice. Everything we needed. Thanks Magnus "

It has a well equipped kitchen and a comfortable living area. The apartment is very close to the metro station and bus stops to take you to the city centre. There is also a lovely park, near the water about a 3 minute walk away, and there are also supermarkets, bars and shops nearby. Camilla even met us at the bus stop to bring us to her apartment.

The neighborhood was the perfect one to be in, especially on the weekend when we were but steps away from the awesome market. The access to both the city and a mini escape to nature with the waterfront paths was exactly what we wanted. 

Camilla was also super communicative and thoughtful, and bent over backwards to be sure our arrival and departure were smooth. We hope to stay here again! We'll most certainly be coming back to the great city of Stockholm. "

She was nicely communicative, gave us some tips, and we appreciated that she picked us up from the subway to lead us to her place and handover the keys. The subway provides a good connection to the city center, and the local neighbor has several shops, some good restaurants and coffee shops, and a few nice places to watch the sunset. The bus to Arlanda airport (Flygbussarna) can be picked up a few minutes walk away from the apartment.  The apartment itself was great; the kitchen is well equipped, the wifi worked without an issue. She made us feel very welcome in Stockholm! "

One can take a nice long walk along the lake and reach Gamla stan. Close to bus stops and walkable to T Bahn and the stop of airport bus.

The apartment itself is bright, cheerful, has a well equipped kitchen.  Very clean.  Was the perfect size for a couple.  Camilla communicated quickly, met us to show the apartment on our schedule and gave us some great tips about the area.  The building managers required copies of our passports.

The apartment itself is fantastic - very modern and well laid out, with plenty of space for us all (a family of four). It is only a few minutes from Langholmen and its small sandy beach, and about a 5-6 minute walk from Hornstull Metro, which makes getting into the centre of Stockholm very easy.

I'd definitely recommend staying here if you are thinking of coming to Stockholm. Takk! "
9933,1304431,13811132,2014-06-05,11633246,Patricia,"We stayed 5 days in Madeleine's apartment, we are a family of 5 (2 children, 3 adults) and it was perfect for us. the flat is spacious, clean, full of light, it has a nice balcony and is very child-friendly (with toys and even a little playground in the backyard). Shops are a few minutes walk away as well as the metro which takes you to the old-town Gamlastan in around 10 minutes. Madeleine left was not there when we arrived but everything went well, she came some days later to greet us in person. The only negative thing was the elevator which was to small for our double-stroller, but this is a very specific problem ;-). We can highly recommend this flat!! Thanks to Madeleine, everything was perfect!"
9934,1304431,14180451,2014-06-14,3812461,Luke,This apartment was lovely to stay in. We were three people sharing two rooms and very comfortable. Madeline was very responsive and the check-in process was very smooth. Our only issue was the curtains in the bedrooms didn't do a very good job blocking the sunlight ... Near midsummer in Sweden that's a bit of a problem lol. If you're staying here in the summer I'd recommend bringing some eyemasks!
9935,1304431,15313472,2014-07-07,13392693,Hilary,"We had a lovely time in Madeleine's apartment. Great setup for our Aussie family of 4, with everything we needed, including a garden with swing, which got the big thumbs up from our daughter!

Madeleine was easy to get in touch with throughout our stay and left ample information about the apartment and area.  We were disappointed to not have working Wifi available, but I believe this was a relatively new issue, and hopefully it will be resolved by the next time anyone comes to stay.

The flat was very nice, super clean, well equipped and does look even better than the photos. Very arranging (we were arriving very late at night), Madeleine has been a perfect host. Everything was clearly explained too.

The area is lovely. A very short walk to the closest tube station. Few shops and restaurants in the street. A nice 20 minutes walk to the Gamla Stan island along the river.

We would definitely recommend the flat to anyone going to Stockholm for a few days!"

The smiles on your faces when you will enter this place after battling in the cold snow!
Experience all the comfort and practicality of this great apartment where everything is well thought-of. There is plenty of room, the balcony is giving into a peaceful internal courtyard. The shower was very nice too!
Location is in a nice street, close to metro station, small park, and available restaurants. Moreover just going down the street is the beginning of a nice walk alongside the river, up the hill and to Monteliusvagen.
Madeleine & PO were very accommodating and even let us leave our luggage until the sunday night when we left. "

Loved it!"

The balcony and outdoor space were lovely additions to the apartment.  The beds were comfortable, although the single child's bed was a bit small for an adult.  The shower was excellent.  There was construction next door which began early in the morning and sometimes made sleeping difficult since we are light sleepers.  The kitchen was well-equipped and easy to use.

9961,1304431,93232945,2016-08-12,28963991,Konny,"The apartment was even nicer as shown in the pictures; it is a lovely place to spend some time in a great town. If you want, you can find everything to cook or to eat just around the apartment. Thanks a lot to Madeleine, we are so glad that we stayed there."
9962,1304431,94495367,2016-08-15,31019233,Jerome,"Appartement moderne et très agréable, confortable, avec beaucoup de charme. Le balcon fleuri, qui donne sur une cour arborée, est un vrai plus pour Stockholm. Le quartier n'a pas beaucoup d'intérêt, mais le métro est proche et rapide pour se rendre au centre."
9963,1304431,101352910,2016-09-12,25596408,Verena,"Unser verlängertes Wochenende in Stockholm war einfach wunderbar. Die Wohnung ist super schön eingerichtet und hat alles was man braucht. Die Lage ist optimal, da man ganz einfach vom Flughafen mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln anreisen kann, die Wohnung ruhig gelegen ist, aber doch genügend Lokale & Einkaufsmöglichkeiten in der Nähe sind. Gamla Stan erreicht man ganz leicht und schnell mit der Metro. Wir haben uns super wohl gefühlt. Check-in und Check-out haben auch unkompliziert funktioniert. Vielen Dank an Madeleine und Ihre Familie, dass wir zu Gast sein durften. "
9964,1304431,124221145,2017-01-01,27565896,Sarah,"Nous avons passé un excellent séjour en famille chez Madeleine. L'appartement est très agréable (fonctionnel et cosy), le quartier calme et résidentiel mais à tout juste 4 stations de métro du centre de Stockholm. "
9965,1304431,142257361,2017-04-07,17650008,Keith,"Madeleine's place was perfect for our family's vacation in Stockholm. The description is accurate and communication with Madeleine was fantastic. Check-in was a breeze. We loved the design and layout of the apartment. It is extremely clean, bright and airy, with a lot of natural light. We highly recommend this apartment and, given the opportunity, would definitely stay here again!"
9966,1304431,144209614,2017-04-15,40895808,Dirk,"we spent a week in this nice down - to earth apartment. very good communication, close to Hornstull Restaurants and bars and Tunnelbana. everything was as described/pictured, easy. Recommendable for up to 3 kids"
9967,1304431,165980627,2017-07-02,132082542,Esther,"Madeleine's home was perfect for my family of 4 (plus babysitter) traveling for business. The neighborhood is quiet but walkable to many shops, restaurants and parks. Madeleine left all the information we needed to feel comfortable and use the amenities easily. Our kids loved her adorable kids' bedroom with a little built-in ""shop"" to play! Thanks again for a wonderful stay, Madeleine!"
9968,1304431,167809393,2017-07-08,75806529,Eula,"Madeleine's apartment is nice for families with children. It is in a quiet residential neighborhood, and it's very close to public transportation. The apartment is very clean and tastefully decorated. The bathroom has a luxurious shower. We didn't meet Madeleine during our stay, but she did email to make sure everything's okay."
9969,1304431,169980403,2017-07-14,95629621,Norman,"We try to go on family vacations in foreign countries with hope to get as genuine as an experience as possible, not tourists living in an environment but living as a true local. Madeleine provided that to us not only through her beautifully and tastefully curated home, but her attention to detail, constant communication and information about the neighborhood. She helped us to acclimate without missing a beat. For the 5 days that we spend here, we felt like it was our home. From having breakfast in the kitchen with the morning light shining through the windows to the ease and accessibility of markets, restaurants and the subway in one of Stockholm's coolest neighborhoods. Upon our departure, one of the things we would miss most is this apartment in Sodermalm. Thank you Madeleine for making our trip so memorable. "
9970,1304431,180674424,2017-08-11,14934345,Mark,I can't recommend Madeleine's place highly enough. The apartment is really lovely and the location is excellent. Lots of restaurants/shops nearby and very easy access to the rest of Stockholm.
9971,1304431,224469037,2018-01-03,156021895,Helen,Lovely homely apartment in a great location
9972,1304431,283556956,2018-06-30,177894339,Daniel,Location was great!  Lovely apartment.   My family had a wonderful stay.
9973,1304431,286061014,2018-07-05,24555797,Vineet,"Madeleine’s place is conveniently located to explore Stockholm. We had a rather late checkin due to SJ rail but Madeleine stayed in constant touch with us and guided us through a remote checkin. We were traveling with a 4 month old infant and when I requested a late check out (again due to SJ rail), she graciously obliged.
The apartment is centrally located and close to lot of trendy eating joints and has all the conveniences you would expect. A great  courtyard facing balcony for your morning coffee. 
We would recommend her place to our friends."
9974,1304431,301946381,2018-08-05,26255205,Simon,"Our young family enjoyed a lovely stay in Madeleine’s apartment. Her style is fantastic and the apartment has everything we needed for us and our 2 little girls. Good location with parks, supermarket and subway nearby. Only a couple of stops to our favourite coffee shop in Stockholm (Drop Coffee) or an extra stop to Slussen where we caught the ferry across to Skansen, Junibacken, Vasa etc. Would definitely stay here again!"
9975,1304431,480199161,2019-07-02,3253089,Jordana,Our stay at Madeleine’s home was pleasant. We were expecting a little more but we got settled into the cozy apartment quickly. The beds in the kids room were very high bunk beds which were fine for our children but will be a problem for younger or less agile people. You have to really climb up into all 3 of them. We were disappointed by the complete lack of closet space available for our personal items for our week long stay. It was however a nice central location to visit Stockholm for the first time which was great!
9976,1304431,504099684,2019-08-07,13214346,Coralie,"C etait top d etre chez Madeleine. Elle nous a laissé plein de conseils.
Tout est beau et bien pensé. L appartement est tout refait, propre et vraiment agreable à vivre.
Dans un quartier sympa avec tout à proximité.
Je recommande vivement.
Vous pouvez y aller les yeux fermés!"
9977,1307331,5718664,2013-07-13,7161629,Maria Cristina,"Una gran bella sorpresa (ed un ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo) questa casa, accogliente e spaziosa, un assaggio dell'atmosfera che gli svedesi sanno creare con il loro eccellente gusto per l'arredamento. A 15 minuto dal centro di Stoccolma, immersa nella natura. Abbiamo avuto come ospiti due caprioli e uno scoiattolo (rosso!). Permette una diversa prospettiva sulla città, che è davvero a portata di mano, con l'abbonamento normale per i trasporti pubblici."
9978,1307331,6164026,2013-08-01,7645446,Marika,"We rented the house for a couple of days in July and had a wonderful stay. The house is spacious and the patio is wonderful. Fairly close to the subway and easy to park on the street.

Bref on y a passez un très bon séjour à 8 (dont 2 enfants)."

It is about 15 minutes by train from the center of the city and the trains run very frequently so it was not a problem.
I highly recommend this place!

9984,1307331,165773313,2017-07-02,13161571,Beata,"We are very happy to stay at Marcus's home. Close to the metro and close to  the center of Stockholm. Quiet and nice  place to stay in a group of friends. Breakfast on the terrace, in the sun, evenings in the large living room. We had a riddle - who would guess how the shower in the upper bathroom would run? Simple ! But surprising solution! Just move the faucet right! The winner had priority in the bathroom. But it was not embarrassing, because the bathrooms are two. Marcus very accurately described everything, left instructions. Thank you very much, best regards! We recommend!"
9985,1307331,181696460,2017-08-13,40604076,Joyce,"Although we didn't meet Marcus at the beginning, but he prepared breakfast to show his warm welcome. The house is cozy and very close to central Stockholm . Very recommend."

9988,1307331,251542421,2018-04-08,18792976,Margherita,"Marcus’ house was just perfect for a group of six people like us. It is very warmly welcoming, and the spaces are well organized, so it’s easy to feel like home. The house is not very central, but the metro station is easily reachable in five minutes and connects you quickly with the main attractions of the city; the neighborhood is also very nice, so we enjoyed going back here at the end of the day.
Marcus is also very reactive and helpful, we haven’t met but he answered fast in every situation, with lots of precious informations.
Everyone of us was satisfied and we had a wonderful experience in this house! 
Warmly recommended and thank you again Marcus and family!"

E' vicina ad un bel lago dove è possibile fare il bagno.

La casa è spaziosa, completa di tutto e con una stanza piena di giochi per i bambini."

The house is great for staying a little outside the centre (the area is very good for Kids - sweet neighbour kids, ballpark nearby and a Nice terrace to stay on for meals in the summertime) and it is very close to the metro to the city centre."
9992,1307331,318032040,2018-09-03,74328532,Paolo,"Marco è stato molto gentile ad accoglierci personalmente per il check in. La casa si trova in una posizione molto comoda per visitare il centro, visto che la metro è a pochi passi e in una decina di minuti si può essere già in zona."

It's cozy and has everything a family need. The kids could play basket outside and there's a beautiful view from the terrace. We really felt stockholm's spirits and way of living (just outside the windows we saw a hare, a squirrel and a fawn) had wonderful experience there!"
